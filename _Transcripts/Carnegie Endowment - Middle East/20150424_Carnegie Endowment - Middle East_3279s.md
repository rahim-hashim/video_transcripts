# Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu on Turkey’s Role in a Turbulent Middle East
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [April 24, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8)
*  Welcome ladies and gentlemen. My name is George Perkovich. I'm a vice president for studies [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=0.0s)]
*  here at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. I want to thank you for joining us [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  for this important afternoon and the opportunity to hear the remarks from the foreign minister [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=12.5s)]
*  of Turkey. He will be talking about absolutely vital issues today of the Middle East, Turkey's [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=17.82s)]
*  relationship with NATO, the Iranian nuclear negotiations, all super important issues [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=26.42s)]
*  in the United States, in Europe, Middle East, and with global implications. We are honored to have [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=33.940000000000005s)]
*  foreign minister Cavusoglu here in from Ankara. He will be making his remarks as we spoke and then [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=41.74s)]
*  we'll be taking questions and offering a discussion before he has to depart. As we mentioned, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=54.18s)]
*  there's no challenge of difficult issues confronting Turkey, its allies, and other states in the region. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=66.84s)]
*  He will be addressing those. One of them that we've worked on here at Carnegie in particular [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=73.74s)]
*  is the challenge posed by Iran's nuclear program and the diplomatic effort to deal with that. We've [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=82.34s)]
*  just published a book here with a colleague Sinan Uğurgan and I, and so it's available outside if [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=91.02000000000001s)]
*  anyone is interested on Turkey's nuclear future looking forward. But as I say, the minister will [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=99.42s)]
*  speak and cover a whole range of these issues and then we'll have a discussion from thereafter. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=105.94s)]
*  Minister Cavusoglu is minister since the last two years, but previously he was a minister of European [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=113.7s)]
*  Union affairs and also is one of the founding leaders of the JK party in Turkey. So with no [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=125.25999999999999s)]
*  further ado, Mr. Minister, please. Thank you so much for the introduction. Distinguished guests, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=134.68s)]
*  ladies and gentlemen, it's a real pleasure to be here with you all today. Let me thank [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=151.56s)]
*  Ambassador Burns in his absence and the Carnegie Endowment for the wonderful reception. I'm here [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=158.92s)]
*  in Washington, DC on an invitation from my good friend, Secretary Kerry. I will also meet with [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=168.83999999999997s)]
*  counterparts from the administration and have contacts on the Hill. Of course, I value all [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=177.39999999999998s)]
*  those meetings that I'm going to have during my stay, but I am equally pleased to address you at [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=186.04s)]
*  this century-old institution. Over the years, Carnegie Endowment turned into a truly global [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=191.88s)]
*  think tank. It has contributed to the international peace through creative ideas and strategic [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=199.56s)]
*  thinking. I am sure you know the famous quote, every great dream begins with a dreamer. The [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=206.88s)]
*  institution has been home to the many dreamers of the peace. That is why I am very happy to have [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=215.08s)]
*  an opportunity to talk to you under this roof about the state of play in Middle East and Turkey's [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  role. And this is a topic on which there has been much debate here in this town, and I know that [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=233.16000000000003s)]
*  not all the comments have been positive. So I appreciate the opportunity to speak about our [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=242.92s)]
*  dream, our vision of new and different Middle East, one that arises on peace, stability, and [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=249.0s)]
*  cooperation. Ladies and gentlemen, today the Middle East is largely in a state of turmoil, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=256.84s)]
*  but the same Middle East has contributed greatly to the philosophical, cultural, and scientific [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=264.68s)]
*  progress of humankind throughout history. President Obama himself highlighted some of these [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=272.52s)]
*  contributions in his historic Cairo speech, and we believe that this region still has the potential [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=279.47999999999996s)]
*  to create great things. So then the question is, how do we turn this potential into concrete [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=288.35999999999996s)]
*  achievements? After decades of oppression and wars, we witnessed the Arab Spring. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=296.44000000000005s)]
*  The people led transformation process started to shake the foundations, very foundations of the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=303.88000000000005s)]
*  century-old status quo in the region. In this process, we played a very positive and supportive [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=309.72s)]
*  role as Turkey. We extended around $3 billion of financial assistance, as well as political and [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=320.28s)]
*  technical expertise, to Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, and Yemen. We also contributed to the efforts of [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=326.84s)]
*  the European Union, as well as the Council of Europe, Venice Commission in all these countries. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=335.64s)]
*  But the transformation process is currently characterized by a massive challenge. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=343.55999999999995s)]
*  Let me identify some of them and also share my views for dealing with all these challenges. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=350.12s)]
*  The conflict in Syria affects Turkey the most. The situation has become more complicated with [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=357.48s)]
*  the emergence of Daesh, or ISIL, you say here in the United States. In other words, the situation [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=363.8s)]
*  in Syria has become a serious national security concern for my country, Turkey. We have provided [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=370.44s)]
*  significant contributions to the international coalition as an active member. We have mobilized [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=378.44s)]
*  our military and other resources in its support. So we agree on the existence of a major threat in [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=385.40000000000003s)]
*  our immediate neighborhood. But we also say that the selective approach focusing just on fighting [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=394.84000000000003s)]
*  terrorism will not remedy the situation in Syria and even in Iraq. The political vacuum in Syria [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=402.04s)]
*  has to be filled with a representative government based on the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=410.84000000000003s)]
*  people. This is the only way to bring a sort of stability in Syria. The Geneva Declaration clearly [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=417.8s)]
*  identifies the necessary roadmap for achieving this kind of political solution. The parties for [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=426.36s)]
*  any negotiations to end the conflict are clear. These are the Syrian National Coalition and the [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=434.28000000000003s)]
*  regime. The coalition is recognized by 114 countries and 13 international organizations [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=442.76s)]
*  as the legitimate opposition. However, after Geneva two negotiations, the regime thinks that [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=449.8s)]
*  it has a free hand to continue its violence against the people. This has to stop. The [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=457.48s)]
*  international community must exert pressure on the regime so that it will sit down at the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=464.04s)]
*  negotiation table. We have been working closely with the United States to find a way to move forward [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=471.96000000000004s)]
*  for a political solution in Syria. Our efforts on implementing training and a Q program is a [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=479.24s)]
*  clear testimony. This program aims to create areas inside Syria that are safe. It will also [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=486.6s)]
*  provide a foothold for Syrians willing to fight Daesh. Ladies and gentlemen, Iraq has been in [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=494.04s)]
*  continuous crisis for many years. Daesh is the latest episode in the drama and maybe the most [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=503.08s)]
*  complicated one. The terrorist organization has occupied more than one-third of Iraq, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=510.76s)]
*  which is equal to the size of Croatia in a short time. This was surprising for many, but we had [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=516.6s)]
*  been warning about this possibility for a long time. Why was Iraq faced with such a crisis? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=524.84s)]
*  What is the reason behind? Simply because of the sectarian and oppressive policies of the previous [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=533.96s)]
*  government after the departure of American troops. So there is a need for a policy that reaches [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=540.2800000000001s)]
*  out to oppress people and the regime and should regain their trust and confidence. I mean the [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=548.52s)]
*  current administration. And new Iraqi government under Abadi started well and gained international [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=557.8s)]
*  support. And Turkey has been also fully support this new inclusive Abadi government in Iraq. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=564.36s)]
*  But it is again our duty to remind the Iraqi government that it needs to do more for winning [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=572.52s)]
*  the others of the country. Promises must turn into concrete actions without further delay. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=578.4399999999999s)]
*  In Iraq, in a short term, there might be some military successes, but lack of confidence [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=587.8s)]
*  between the people and the government is unfortunately continuing. Military successes [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=594.68s)]
*  will not be enough. There is a need for political and humanitarian steps taken at the same time. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=602.04s)]
*  Tikrit and the other liberated cities should be held and run by the locals. People shouldn't feel [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=610.68s)]
*  that they have come under another term of oppression in Iraq. Iraq cannot be governed [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=618.04s)]
*  as before Daesh. It should evolve into the functioning federal state. This is not something [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=627.72s)]
*  new obviously. It was also foreseen in the Iraqi constitution. We know and we now [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=636.12s)]
*  know the task at hand is not easy. And we shouldn't put undue pressure on the new government. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=645.64s)]
*  But unfortunately the urgency is all too evident. That is why we are providing political, military, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=658.36s)]
*  and humanitarian support to Iraq. And we are carrying out a training program for the Kurdish [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=667.0s)]
*  regional government, KRG, and Mosul National Guard Units. We have already trained more than [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=674.28s)]
*  1,600 Peshmerga's in KRG. And on the humanitarian side, we are hosting nearly two million people from [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=682.12s)]
*  Syria and Iraq combined. Our expenditure has reached almost six billion dollars, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=693.88s)]
*  whereas we receive only 300 million dollar word support from the international community. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=700.76s)]
*  We are also doing our part to stop the flow of foreign terrorist fighters. We have taken all [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=709.3199999999999s)]
*  the necessary measures. We have set up a no entry list, which now involves more than 12,800 people. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=716.6s)]
*  And we have captured and deported around 1,300 people in this context. And about half of them, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=726.12s)]
*  we didn't have any information from the source countries. Thanks to the sensitive work of our [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=735.88s)]
*  security and also intelligence, we have captured and deported them to the source countries. And we [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=743.08s)]
*  informed all those source countries of these foreign fighters. But this is not an issue that [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=753.3199999999999s)]
*  Turkey can solve on its own. We need improved information sharing and more international [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=760.92s)]
*  cooperation, particularly from the source countries. And the source countries should also [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=770.92s)]
*  start asking themselves the hardest question, who is really the weakest link in this chain? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=776.92s)]
*  In addition to Syria and Iraq, we see sectarianism as a general threat to the region in the Middle [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=785.0s)]
*  East. There is a standard message that we give to all actors and parties. Sectarian based policies [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=791.8s)]
*  create no-win situation. All lose in sectarian struggles, including first and foremost those who [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=799.32s)]
*  favor these policies. Yemen is the most recent example pointing at such dangers. In both Yemen [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=807.8000000000001s)]
*  and Libya, what we need is political dialogue, meaningful political dialogue. We need political [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=818.12s)]
*  solutions based on the national compromise and consensus in both those two countries. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=826.12s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, as a cornerstone of peace and stability, the Middle East, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=832.68s)]
*  in the Middle East, Egypt is another potential risk for the region. Egypt is an important country [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=839.8s)]
*  for the Muslim world. Egypt is important for the Middle East. And Egypt is a very crucial country [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=847.64s)]
*  for not only Northern Africa, but for the whole continent. Egyptian leadership pushes those people. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=853.88s)]
*  They see as opposition underground and towards radicalism. Our concern is that if the current [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=862.84s)]
*  trend is left unchecked, a new and more violent social outburst in Egypt will be inevitable. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=870.2s)]
*  Egypt's deep and structural problems can only be solved in a liberal and efficient political [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=878.52s)]
*  environment. Therefore, we encourage all parties to advocate the establishment of an inclusive [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=885.4s)]
*  political system in Egypt too. Ladies and gentlemen, of course, one cannot speak about [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=892.3599999999999s)]
*  the Middle East without touching upon the Palestinian issue because it remains the core [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=899.88s)]
*  challenge in the region. And actually, we all know parameters of the solution. A state of Israel [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=908.04s)]
*  living side by side with an independent and sovereign state of Palestine on 1967 borders [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=916.76s)]
*  with East Jerusalem as its capital. Yet despite the best and most sincere efforts of my dear [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=925.56s)]
*  friend, Secretary Kerry, the two-state solution is in a coma. You all know the recent Palestinian [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=933.16s)]
*  initiative regarding UN Security Council resolution to initiate a peace conference. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=941.0s)]
*  Such a resolution will make the Israeli side sit down for serious negotiations for a two-state [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=949.88s)]
*  solution. Unfortunately, this initiative, like others trying to open the way to peace, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=957.5600000000001s)]
*  failed at the United Nations Security Council. The main body responsible for protecting international [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=964.5200000000001s)]
*  peace and security once again proved incapable of performing its task. Dear guests, ladies and [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=971.56s)]
*  gentlemen, yes, the general picture in the Middle East is not very promising, but there are also [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=981.7199999999999s)]
*  reasons for being hopeful and to be optimistic as well. Look at the political process in Tunisia. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=989.16s)]
*  This country shows us that a legitimate political solution is possible to the problems faced by the [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=996.36s)]
*  countries in transition. The Tunisian people deserve our full support and solidarity. We are [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1002.2s)]
*  also very pleased with the political understanding reached between the P5-plus-1 and Iran in Lausanne. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1010.52s)]
*  We always advocated diplomacy as the only possible option for a solution to the issue of Iran's [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1019.64s)]
*  nuclear program. That is why we hope that the ongoing negotiations result in a comprehensive [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1026.76s)]
*  agreement by the end of June this year. As always, we are ready to offer our active support to the [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1034.28s)]
*  process. We also hope that a final and satisfactory solution to the nuclear issue [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1043.8s)]
*  might motivate our Iranian neighbors and brothers to facilitate the resolution of other [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1051.72s)]
*  regional problems. In short, our approach in the Middle East is based on finding comprehensive, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1062.2s)]
*  political, and inclusive solutions. So let me put what we imagine into a picture. A secure and [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1069.8s)]
*  stable Middle East where the energy and trade rules interconnected East Mediterranean resources [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1079.4s)]
*  to all directions, a region which no longer makes the headlines with death tolls, but rather with [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1085.72s)]
*  cooperation projects and success stories. Turkey is doing its part to invest in a common future [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1093.6399999999999s)]
*  in the region. We are putting a lot of efforts in increasing and liberalizing trade, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1100.9199999999998s)]
*  lifting visas, expanding investments in the region. On the humanitarian side, being the third largest [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1106.9199999999998s)]
*  donor in humanitarian aid in the world, we continue to extend our helping hand throughout the region. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1113.8799999999999s)]
*  We are trying to ease the pains not only in Syria, but also in Iraq and Palestine. In Iraq, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1123.6399999999999s)]
*  we are among the first to come to the help by sending 750 trucks containing food kits, tents, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1131.08s)]
*  bedding, blankets, medicines, and medical equipment. Our official humanitarian assistance to Gaza only [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1137.56s)]
*  last year is more than $19 million. And we will continue to work for a better future for everyone [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1145.0s)]
*  in the Middle East. Ladies and gentlemen, dear guests, I know our topic is Middle East, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1153.96s)]
*  but speaking as the Turkish foreign minister in Washington, I will not be doing my job in full [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1160.9199999999998s)]
*  if I don't mention two other issues, two issues which have created mistrust and confrontation in [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1166.44s)]
*  our region for a long time. First, Cyprus. We have a window of opportunity to find a political [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1174.2s)]
*  settlement to a problem that has been with us for 50, more than 50 years. And we believe 2015 [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1181.64s)]
*  will be an important year for the settlement of the Cyprus issue. Our commitment for a solution [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1191.64s)]
*  is as strong as ever. We expect the negotiations to resume very soon after the elections in the [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1199.3200000000002s)]
*  north. And the Turkish side is ready to go to the extra mile to make a lasting settlement possible [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1206.76s)]
*  before the end of this year. But ultimately, it takes two to tango. And what is needed for [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1213.0s)]
*  a settlement is true political will. If Greek Cypriot side and the Greece show a similarly [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1220.44s)]
*  strong political will, there is no reason why a settlement cannot be reached by the end of [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1226.44s)]
*  this year. As always, the active involvement of the U.S. will be important in the critical period [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1233.3999999999999s)]
*  ahead. Second, the Turkish-Armenian relations. We have been working since 2009 to overcome the [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1243.32s)]
*  division between these two ancient peoples, two people who for centuries coexisted in peace and [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1251.48s)]
*  harmony. Let me underline this point. Turkey shares the suffering of Armenians. We try with [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1260.52s)]
*  patience and resolve to establish empathy between two peoples. We continue to believe that we can [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1267.48s)]
*  build a peaceful, common future only through dialogue. In this context, our president's message [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1279.96s)]
*  last year on the events of 1915 was a historic step. The recent statement of our prime minister [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1288.36s)]
*  in January, I mean, was another step forward representing our humane perspective. And a couple [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1298.36s)]
*  of hours ago, Prime Minister Davutoglu extended his condolences to the Ottoman Armenians who lost [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1307.4799999999998s)]
*  their lives under the tragic circumstances of World War I. And he also announced that [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1315.56s)]
*  in parallel to the remembrance ceremonies around the world, our ceremony will also be held at [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1322.9199999999998s)]
*  Armenian patriarchy in Istanbul on 24th of April. This is another step of historic significance. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1330.04s)]
*  And we will continue on this path. And we will continue to work for a framework that both [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1341.0800000000002s)]
*  addresses the historic aspects of the problem and also helps solve the Nagorno-Karabakh issue. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1346.2s)]
*  Dear guests, ladies and gentlemen, geography is destiny. And today we stand at the crossroads [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1354.44s)]
*  for the region. We in Turkey believe in the promise of our region and its peoples. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1362.76s)]
*  We are willing and able to stand up to the existing challenges, and so is the United States. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1370.68s)]
*  The history of Turkish-American relations is full of success stories we wrote by working together. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1378.04s)]
*  Our past achievements in Afghanistan, in the Balkans, and elsewhere is testimony [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1384.76s)]
*  to what we can do together in the future. That is what gives me the confidence to say that [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1389.48s)]
*  Turkey and the United States will continue to work as close partners. Because by working together, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1396.84s)]
*  we have a better chance of creating a bright future, we imagine, for the Middle East. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1405.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1411.1599999999999s)]
*  Can I answer the questions? If you don't mind? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1419.32s)]
*  Please, he's going to stay here. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1423.0s)]
*  For technical reasons, it's better. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1425.96s)]
*  It's much better for the vision. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1428.04s)]
*  I want to thank the foreign minister for those remarks. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1431.0800000000002s)]
*  We're going to take questions and we will do it in the normal way that we do things here, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1444.3600000000001s)]
*  which is raise your hand. I'll call on several questioners. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1449.8s)]
*  We'll take several questions together. The foreign minister has been kind enough to [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1454.84s)]
*  stay to address those questions. Please, again, there will be many people who want to ask questions, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1460.76s)]
*  so make your question very brief and also in the form of a question, please. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1465.8799999999999s)]
*  And also, please introduce yourself before you start. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1472.9199999999998s)]
*  Let's start with these three right here in this row. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1476.92s)]
*  Thanks, George. Barbara Slavin from the Atlantic Council and AllMonitor.com. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1487.0800000000002s)]
*  Mr. Minister, how do you square your views with those of the Saudis, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1491.8000000000002s)]
*  particularly when it comes to an issue like Yemen? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1496.1200000000001s)]
*  Your prime minister was recently in Iran. You've called for a political solution there. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1500.68s)]
*  But you are also, I believe, supporting the Saudi effort, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1506.52s)]
*  which is now bombing the country with no apparent result. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1509.96s)]
*  So how do you bring people to the table here? And if I may also ask a question, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1513.96s)]
*  another question, is Turkey taking a position on the direct supply of weapons to the Kurds in Iraq? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1519.8799999999999s)]
*  Thanks. Kurds in Iran? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1526.2s)]
*  Hold that question for one second and then pass it here. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1529.8s)]
*  Michael Gordon, New York Times. On a different subject, sir, you mentioned the [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1532.84s)]
*  negotiations with Iran. The details aren't known, but the basic principles are known. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1542.52s)]
*  It will extend breakout time to a year for a period of 10 years, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1548.36s)]
*  but breakout time will shrink after that. No facilities will be closed and Iran will be [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1552.2s)]
*  allowed to do research and development on centrifuges. What is Turkey's position on this [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1557.16s)]
*  agreement since the main elements are known? And are there any circumstances in which Turkey [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1563.16s)]
*  would feel that it should pursue the development of nuclear technology on its own as a precaution [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1568.52s)]
*  against an Iranian breakout? What would those circumstances be? Thank you. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1575.0s)]
*  Okay. Well, unfortunately, the situation is Yemen is a concern for all of us. And Houthis [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1578.6s)]
*  took the control of the whole country and a democratically elected president had to [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1593.9599999999998s)]
*  leave the country due to the security concerns. Of course, due to the invitation of the legitimate [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1600.68s)]
*  president, Saudi Arabia-led GCC countries had the operation. And this operation became legitimate. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1610.52s)]
*  And in principle, we supported this operation. And we announced that we can, if they need, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1621.3200000000002s)]
*  we can support, we can give them a logistic support and intelligence as well. But so far, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1628.76s)]
*  we haven't received any demand from the Saudi Arabia-led coalition. But at the end, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1635.8799999999999s)]
*  Turkey is for political solution and immediate ceasefire and humanitarian aid. We are very [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1642.84s)]
*  sensitive in that. And broad-based political dialogue, meaningful political dialogue, and [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1649.08s)]
*  possibly national unity, administration or government in Yemen. That is what we need. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1656.68s)]
*  And that is Turkey's position. And I was with Erdogan in Tehran, and he was very straight with [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1664.76s)]
*  our Iranian counterparts that what Iran is doing, their sectarian policies, ambitious in the region, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1673.48s)]
*  is not helpful and not helping their interests either. So we were very clear with Iran. But [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1682.68s)]
*  we can, Iran should be also involved in the process, in this process that I mentioned in Yemen. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1691.4s)]
*  They should also use their influence on Houthis that they should withdraw and there should be [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1699.4s)]
*  ceasefire and meaningful dialogue and so on. And regarding the [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1705.08s)]
*  basic principles, the current achievement between P5 Plus One and Iran, we are fully supporting this [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1714.52s)]
*  process and we are fully supporting the achievements. And we haven't underestimated, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1722.28s)]
*  we shouldn't underestimate the achievements made in this process. And we also spent a lot of [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1728.36s)]
*  efforts together with Brazil in 2010, and it was not easy to convince Iran. Iran is our brotherly [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1734.9199999999998s)]
*  country, our neighbor, but it is not always easy to make deal with Iran. We haven't even changed [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1742.9199999999998s)]
*  the gas agreement that Turkey signed long years ago, and hopefully we can find a solution to that [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1748.9199999999998s)]
*  as well. But we are fully supporting this process and we are against nuclear weapons [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1755.24s)]
*  in our neighborhood. Not only in Iran, but we are against nuclear weapons. And Turkey has no [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1764.2s)]
*  intention to have a nuclear weapon. We didn't and we will not have nuclear weapons. Thank you. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1770.84s)]
*  Yes, I'm Tom Deval here at the Carnegie Endowment. Minister, thank you for your remarks. I'm going [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1785.24s)]
*  to ask you an Armenian question without mentioning the word genocide apart from just now. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1789.64s)]
*  You already did. I already did, yes. But you yourself today and also the Prime Minister and [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1796.28s)]
*  the President have gone much further than Turkish officials in the past in acknowledging the [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1803.0s)]
*  suffering of the Armenians. But as you yourself would know, the situation on the ground is still [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1806.92s)]
*  very bad. The border is closed. And to give one other example, very few working churches, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1812.2s)]
*  Armenian churches in Turkey, many churches still in ruins. I wonder if you can share any [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1818.28s)]
*  concrete steps that your government will and can take to advance reconciliation with the Armenians? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1824.28s)]
*  Thank you. Well, first of all, regarding the Armenians living in Turkey, we have around 40,000 [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1831.16s)]
*  Armenian citizens. I think there are two candidates as well from different parties. One of them is [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1838.84s)]
*  from my party. They are enjoying all the rights. And they are also enjoying the rights that the [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1845.6399999999999s)]
*  Turkish government and state has been giving back. I mean, this is not something, not that we [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1851.24s)]
*  give it for free, but it was their rights taken in the past in Turkey. But it's not only them that [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1859.9599999999998s)]
*  all the religious minorities have been enjoying. We have been giving their properties back. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1868.6s)]
*  We have been renovating the church, chapels, and synagogues. We just integrated a grand synagogue [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1873.9599999999998s)]
*  in Edirne recently, and Turkey restored it. And we restored Armenian church in Akhtamar Island in Lake One. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1880.9199999999998s)]
*  And Armenians get together every year for worship in that church. And we need to do more, and we [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1889.96s)]
*  are supporting the patriarch as well, patriarchy in Istanbul, based in Istanbul, and also Armenian [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1900.6799999999998s)]
*  foundations. And our citizens plus another roughly 40,000 Armenian migrants also enjoying living in [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1907.96s)]
*  Turkey. We know that they had to leave Armenia because of unemployment and poor economy. And [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1917.24s)]
*  they are irregular migrants. I don't like to use the word illegal as the former president of the [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1925.88s)]
*  Parliamentary Assembly of Council of Europe. They are not illegal people, but they are irregular [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1931.4s)]
*  migrants. We tolerate that they stay in Turkey. And regarding the Turkey-Armenian issue and [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1936.04s)]
*  reconciliation, we are for reconciliation. And we have been spending a lot of efforts, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1945.16s)]
*  particularly since 2009. Of course, this year, Armenian-Armenian diaspora [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1953.72s)]
*  focus to influence the world public opinion on the events of 1915. So we are not expecting [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1962.92s)]
*  any positive response from our Armenian friends, but we understood that we have to look forward. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1972.36s)]
*  And we need to overcome all these issues. And the statements of President Erdogan and the [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1982.04s)]
*  President, Prime Minister Davutoglu's two statements are a kind of turning point in Turkey as well. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1989.56s)]
*  So we have been taking courageous steps towards reconciliation. I hope [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=1996.2s)]
*  Armenia and our Armenian friends also understand that we need reconciliation. And we will not give [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2003.72s)]
*  up as Turkey, and we should continue to spend efforts towards reconciliation. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2011.3200000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2016.76s)]
*  Thanks, George. I'm Mahir Zeynel from Turkey's Today's Saman Daily. Mr. Prime Minister, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2022.44s)]
*  I'm wondering if you remember last year your government... [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2027.48s)]
*  Did you call me Prime Minister? Thank you. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2030.04s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry. Mr. Prime Minister, I was wondering if you remember last year your [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2031.4s)]
*  government kicked me and my family out of the Turkey because I tweeted a single report on [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2036.04s)]
*  Twitter. And also, your government has recently arrested journalists Hidayet Karaca and Mehmet [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2041.64s)]
*  Baran. So how do you reconcile these incidents with the democracy and the media freedom in [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2046.12s)]
*  Turkey? Thank you. Thank you for being concise. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2050.7599999999998s)]
*  Thank you. This gentleman here will take the two and then... [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2053.96s)]
*  Hi. Thank you. I don't have a question, but my name is Abdul Halim Brigal. I'm originally from [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2056.6s)]
*  Somalia. I'm a Somali-American. And I thank Mr. Foreign Minister and welcoming him here. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2061.4s)]
*  The success for Turkey, everyone knows it's Somalia. So thank you for your government, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2068.7599999999998s)]
*  for your people. And Mr. Erdogan, who went to Mogadishu in 2011, during that time no one was [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2073.96s)]
*  going to Mogadishu. Today, Mogadishu and Somalia, it stands where we are because of that leadership [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2081.2400000000002s)]
*  and the vision that Mr. Erdogan showed. I went on the Somali, the Turkish Istanbul Conference [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2087.88s)]
*  on Somalia. And at that time, I met with Mr. Erdogan when he was the Prime Minister. And I [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2096.2s)]
*  promised him at the time, I say to him, I don't know what to give you as a gift because it was [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2102.04s)]
*  very quick. So today I have a gift here. I will give it to the embassy. Thank you. It's a book. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2107.16s)]
*  It's not any book. It's the Quran, our book, is the Defined Word of Allah, Subhanahu wa Ta'ala. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2112.52s)]
*  And this is where Daesh al-Shabaab is the same book that's read by 1. something billion Muslims [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2118.92s)]
*  that has been hijacked by a bunch of criminals. So thank you very much. And I will give it to the [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2125.88s)]
*  embassy. Thank you. Should I? Well, media freedom is crucial for democratic societies. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2131.72s)]
*  And as a former president of the Parliamentary Assembly, which is the home of rule of law, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2146.68s)]
*  democracy and fundamental rights, and I am fully for free media and freedom of expression. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2153.64s)]
*  However, in democratic societies and countries, nobody is immune from [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2163.24s)]
*  prosecutions because of his or her profession. And regarding the journalists in Turkey, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2170.6s)]
*  the latest Committee to Protect Journalists, CPJ, reported seven journalists imprisoned [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2177.72s)]
*  in Turkey. And when you look at the list, none of them are prosecuted for their journalistic work. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2189.3999999999996s)]
*  And as a matter of fact, five of them charged with serious crimes such as homicide, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2198.4399999999996s)]
*  causing injury with weapons, bank robbery, forgery, throwing molotov cocktails to the [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2203.7999999999997s)]
*  security officers. And two of these journalists have been released. And we see the similar cases [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2211.96s)]
*  in other democratic countries as well. For instance, following the news of the world phone [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2222.04s)]
*  hacking scandal in the UK, the news editor of the said newspaper, Ian Edmison, was sentenced to [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2227.48s)]
*  eight months. And Andy Colson, editor of the News World World, was also sentenced to 18 months [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2234.76s)]
*  in jail for conspiring to hack phones in 2014. And there are also other similar cases I have to give [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2243.0s)]
*  here in Italy, Greece, as well as this country, United States. For instance, Francesco Gangami, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2252.04s)]
*  the 79-year-old editor of the monthly magazine, Debattito, it means debate. And Alessandro [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2260.6s)]
*  Salusti, editor-in-chief of the Milan-based Daily, are present for charge of libel, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2273.96s)]
*  perjury, and criminal defamation. Let me give you another example. There is also another example [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2281.0s)]
*  in Greece, but since it is our good neighbor, I don't want to give this example. Another example [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2287.32s)]
*  from this country, Barack Brown, he is a U.S. journalist, and he has been sentenced to 63 months [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2292.44s)]
*  of imprisonment in January 2015 for involvement in activities of a hacktivist group called [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2302.04s)]
*  Anonymous. So for me, even one journalist in prison because of his or her journalistic words [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2311.32s)]
*  is unacceptable. So is for Turkey. Therefore, Turkey cannot tolerate any parallel structure, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2319.56s)]
*  particularly Oppostar structures in the state structures. And no democratic country can [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2328.92s)]
*  tolerate this either. Thank you. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2337.64s)]
*  Thank you very much. My name is Tyler Thompson. I'm with United for Syria. I was hoping that you [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2350.28s)]
*  could expand on, we've been hearing that Turkey backs the idea of either a no-fly zone or some [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2356.12s)]
*  sort of protected zone to save Syrian civilians along the Turkish border. And I'm wondering if [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2363.72s)]
*  you could sort of expand on what the Turkish policy is on that and also explain any roadblocks or [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2370.3599999999997s)]
*  obstacles that the United States may be presenting in the time for protecting civilians. Can you [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2377.0s)]
*  repeat the last part of your question, the obstacles in the United States? The obstacles [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2382.12s)]
*  that the United States might present to Turkey in implementing this type of protected area. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2385.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2391.5600000000004s)]
*  Thank you. Just pass the mic to the gentleman there and then we'll take the two together. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2393.5600000000004s)]
*  Karan Israelian, Embassy of Armenia. Thank you very much, Mr. Foreign Minister, for your address. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2399.2400000000002s)]
*  Given your extensive experience in the European affairs, in your tenure at the Council of Europe's [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2406.28s)]
*  Parliamentary Assembly, I just wonder if you can comment on the fact that on April 15, 2015, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2413.88s)]
*  the European Parliament has adopted a resolution which officially recognizes the tragic events that [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2421.7200000000003s)]
*  have faced Armenians during the Ottoman Empire as a genocide and where it calls upon the European [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2429.88s)]
*  Council and the European Commission and Turkey as well to recognize the event as the genocide and [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2439.16s)]
*  to come to terms with your past and thus pave a way for a genuine reconciliation between Turkish [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2445.3199999999997s)]
*  and Armenian people. Thank you very much. Thank you for the questions. Before I answer this question, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2453.64s)]
*  I forgot to respond my Somalian friend. Thank you very much for the gift first of all. And we are [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2460.52s)]
*  doing our best to support Somalian people and we just built a hospital with 200 beds and Turkey is [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2466.44s)]
*  running this hospital now but hopefully in five years time we will hand over to the Somalian that [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2474.04s)]
*  we are training them right now, the doctors and the staff and then hopefully they will be able to [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2481.08s)]
*  run that hospital. And we also build hospitals in other African countries including Sudan and [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2487.08s)]
*  serving not only those people of those those countries but citizens of other African countries [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2493.72s)]
*  and we are developing we are supporting the development projects in almost all African [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2500.2799999999997s)]
*  countries and we will continue. And thank you very much for the gift once again. Regarding the [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2505.64s)]
*  safe zone, Turkey proposed safe zone with air cover or no fly zone. We know the realities of the [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2512.7599999999998s)]
*  region very well. And as I mentioned in my introductory speech, we warned our allies and [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2524.3599999999997s)]
*  other countries in the coalition right now about the possible developments in Syria and also in Iraq. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2533.08s)]
*  Unfortunately, our recommendations or advices were not taken into account. Now including [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2541.3999999999996s)]
*  United States our friends regret that they didn't. Now we are proposing [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2547.88s)]
*  safe zone because it's a must in Syria. First of all we need safe areas. Now we are implementing [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2555.1600000000003s)]
*  the train and equip program and we need safe zones in Syria for the success of this program [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2562.92s)]
*  on in the ground. Secondly, you know how many refugees living in the neighboring countries, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2572.36s)]
*  Syrian refugees including Turkey, more than five four million. And you know how many IDPs [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2580.28s)]
*  in Syria, more than eight million. And who is helping these vulnerable people? Turkey is doing [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2588.1200000000003s)]
*  its best and we are supplying whatever they need particularly in the camps. Now [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2594.6s)]
*  around 240,000 of them living in the 25 camps that we built. Another 38,000 living in the camps, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2600.68s)]
*  three camps that we built in northern Iraq. And we are supplying education, health care, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2609.08s)]
*  and food and everything. Now the budget is budget of World Food Organization [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2616.52s)]
*  is run out and we have to support those vulnerable people living in Turkey not only in the camps but [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2624.04s)]
*  in all over the Turkey. But these people deserve better. Can we give proper education to the [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2631.16s)]
*  children? There are 500,000 Syrians in Turkey at the age of education and we have been able to give [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2638.36s)]
*  education to only 140,000 of them. What will happen to another 360,000 Syrian children? [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2645.48s)]
*  And we have more than 100,000 new born babies in, Syrian babies in Turkey. So what I mean, [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2655.56s)]
*  this zone is also essential to relocate all these refugees and also IDPs. Our guests in Turkey [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2664.68s)]
*  living in better condition than the ones living in other neighboring countries. I'm not blaming [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2674.52s)]
*  them because they are also doing best but they cannot afford actually particularly Lebanon and [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2680.36s)]
*  Jordan. So we need to relocate these people in this safe zone with all the infrastructure [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2688.6s)]
*  that they need, school, hospitals, and whatever they need. So that's why we propose this safe zone. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2696.04s)]
*  And the main problem is here how as the coalition is going to enhance the security for this safe [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2702.92s)]
*  zone. Whether it should be supported by no-fly zone or air cover. Obviously we think different [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2710.6s)]
*  here with United States or United States have different proposals or different ideas of this [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2721.8s)]
*  safe zone and no-fly zone. But if we agree we would, we should together, do together, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2729.72s)]
*  we should implement together with United States. So we are not, Turkey is not insisting to do, [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2736.76s)]
*  to enhance the safe zone or no-fly zone as its own self. So but unfortunately few [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2744.04s)]
*  uh coalition members like France gave full support but other uh the uh core countries, [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2753.32s)]
*  the core members of the coalition has uh or have different opinion on this safe zone. But uh we [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2761.1600000000003s)]
*  will continue uh try to convince our allies. And regarding the Armenian issue and the Europe [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2770.5200000000004s)]
*  decision of the European Parliament, it's uh Euro-skeptic party I think made this proposal. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2781.4s)]
*  It doesn't matter who did but this resolution is not legally binding and it's not binding. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2788.6800000000003s)]
*  And uh to our mind the politicians, national parliaments, and the European parliaments or [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2796.84s)]
*  international uh or parliamentary assemblies of international organizations [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2806.36s)]
*  shouldn't give such decision. We shouldn't politicize this issue. And I know as politician [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2811.48s)]
*  it is not that easy to decide about the history. I also wrote a lot of reports for the parliamentary [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2818.92s)]
*  assembly of the Council of Europe on missing persons in the Balkans and and so on. And I [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2827.2400000000002s)]
*  wrote one of the most difficult report for the parliament resum on mass famine, mass famine in [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2834.12s)]
*  1932 and 1933 or Holodomor or Golodomor. So it was not an easy job. And I visited Kazakhstan, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2842.68s)]
*  Russia, Caucasus part of Russia, Ukraine, and also Belarus for a fact-finding [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2852.92s)]
*  uh visit. And I met everybody. And then president of Ukraine, Yushchenko, was obviously for genocide. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2859.56s)]
*  And he arranged a group of scientists uh to meet me. And during the meeting at at the end of the [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2870.52s)]
*  meeting uh 40 percent of those scientists historians told me that it was a genocide. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2877.64s)]
*  And 30 percent of them said uh no it was not genocide. And another 30 percent said we don't [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2884.6s)]
*  have idea or I don't have idea. So as a politician how can I decide whether it was [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2891.2400000000002s)]
*  or it was not a genocide? But in my report I said crime against humanity for mass famine in 1932 [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2898.52s)]
*  and 1933. Well who is going to decide whether it was a genocide or not? [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2907.64s)]
*  Obviously genocide is not a generic term. It's a legal term. And to our mind historians should also [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2914.44s)]
*  decide. That's why we propose Armenia to step a joint to set up a joint committee of historians [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2925.16s)]
*  and scientists. And we should open we propose to open the archives. And this joint committee [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2931.96s)]
*  shouldn't be limited with Armenian and Turkish scientists and the scientists historians from [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2939.96s)]
*  third countries could also participate. And the third countries should also open the [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2945.32s)]
*  archives. And we committed in our letter in the letter of prime minister Erdogan [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2952.92s)]
*  uh we committed to accept the outcome of this study. So what else you expect from Turkey? [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2959.08s)]
*  Why don't we set up this joint committee of historians? Let them study. Let open the archive [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2967.0s)]
*  and we will accept the outcome. Otherwise it's easy to convince parliamentarians to sign the [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2973.0s)]
*  resolution or to adopt the resolution. But it doesn't help to solve the problem. It didn't. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2979.08s)]
*  In the past the national parliaments of some countries in Europe, in Latin America, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2985.4s)]
*  adopted such resolutions. But it didn't help. I think Turkey and Armenia and Turkish and [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2990.84s)]
*  Armenian people should solve this issue together. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks very much. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=2998.36s)]
*  Abdelrahim from Al Jazeera. You have peace and stability in Europe and then you have chaos in [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3010.6s)]
*  the Middle East. Do you ever regret having invested so much effort and attention in your [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3017.56s)]
*  Middle East policy? And are you ever concerned that Bashar al-Assad if he stays much longer in [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3024.12s)]
*  power is going to suck Turkey into the vortex of Middle Eastern chaos? Thank you. Thank you very [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3031.24s)]
*  much. It's true that despite all the challenges that European societies have been facing, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3038.12s)]
*  like economic and financial crisis, migration issues and integration, and also international [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3045.64s)]
*  crime and organized crime and international terrorism, climate change, you can, I can name [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3056.04s)]
*  more, despite all these challenges, the European continent is still the most stable and most [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3063.56s)]
*  developed and most democratic continent. And we never regret for investing in Middle East. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3070.68s)]
*  You cannot always succeed. But we should do our best to support the Middle Eastern people. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3078.68s)]
*  And we should support the countries suffering from all these [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3086.12s)]
*  crises. That's why we give full support to the new Iraqi government, inclusive government. And [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3092.52s)]
*  regarding Syria, yes, we have to eradicate the blooded terrorist organization Daesh. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3102.44s)]
*  But meanwhile, we should also eradicate the root causes of the problem. Yesterday, there was no [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3110.84s)]
*  Daesh in Middle East, in Iraq and Syria. There was Al-Qaeda. Daesh was emerged from Al-Qaeda in Iraq. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3116.84s)]
*  Then they got support from different circles and they moved to Syria and they got a lot of support [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3124.44s)]
*  from the regime. That's why they have this Russian, Chinese and Serbian made weapons in their hand. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3130.76s)]
*  And then when they feel themselves strong enough, they went back to Iraq, they captured Mosul, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3138.36s)]
*  and they also kept our consulate staff as hostage for 102 days. And at the end, we were able to bring [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3144.2000000000003s)]
*  them through a smooth operation. That's another story. But, and in Mosul, the Shia militias of [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3152.2000000000003s)]
*  Maliki, around 70,000 of them left Mosul and they left all these heavy weapons behind. And Daesh got [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3160.36s)]
*  them tanks, altruists, and even missiles and all these heavy weapons. American made one. Now Daesh [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3169.88s)]
*  has American and Russian made weapons in their hands. And they advanced in both Syria and Iraq [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3177.4s)]
*  with all this power. But if we don't eradicate the root causes, yesterday it was Al-Qaeda, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3185.16s)]
*  then Al-Nusra, then Daesh, and tomorrow we don't know who is going to be emerged as [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3191.96s)]
*  terrorist organization. So the current situation and the regime is the fertile ground [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3197.64s)]
*  for the radicalization and terrorism in Syria. Therefore, Assad must go and we cannot unite the [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3203.96s)]
*  people of Syria around Assad anymore because this regime is killing. As long as Assad stays, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3210.92s)]
*  they will continue killing people through the barrel bombs, through the chemical weapons, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3219.32s)]
*  through the crawling gas, and air bombings. And Aleppo is very strategic town and around 2 million [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3223.8s)]
*  civilians living there. Therefore, we never regret for where we stand for the Middle East. And [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3232.12s)]
*  Turkish foreign policy is multidimensional one anyway. And this multidimensional and [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3243.08s)]
*  proactive policy is complementary. They are not alternative to each other. Thank you very much. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3251.24s)]
*  On behalf of everybody here, I want to thank Foreign Minister Shavashola for [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3262.2s)]
*  your remarks and especially for your taking all these questions and addressing them. Wish [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3265.96s)]
*  you well on the rest of your stay here. And please come back and join us again. Thank you very much. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8RgG1lKd8&t=3272.04s)]
