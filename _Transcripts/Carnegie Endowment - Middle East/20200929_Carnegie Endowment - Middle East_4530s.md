Video Description: Lebanon is endowed with a rich and diverse national ecosystem, and has the potential and responsibility to fight pollution and deforestation, while investing in green spaces and clean energy. Moving forward, how can Lebanon ensure that the environment does not take a back seat in its national priorities, given the many other pressing issues facing the country today?

# Turning Black to Green
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [September 29, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc)
*  Okay. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=0.0s)]
*  Hi everyone. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=15.88s)]
*  I'm Dalal Mawad. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=16.88s)]
*  I'm a journalist with the Associated Press and I'll be moderating this afternoon's panel, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=18.96s)]
*  which is the fourth and the last panel of a series of panels organized by Carnegie Middle [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=25.76s)]
*  East and the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung about Lebanon and the centennial. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  Many issues have been discussed in the past, in the previous three sessions today. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=38.92s)]
*  The environment, which is a crucial and important topic, is on the table, despite everything [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=44.6s)]
*  that Lebanon is witnessing. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=50.7s)]
*  I'm going to leave the floor now to the director of the Carnegie Middle East Centre, Maha Yahya, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=55.400000000000006s)]
*  and then to Malte Geier from the Stiftung to talk about this series and then we'll go [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=60.92s)]
*  into our discussion. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=66.52000000000001s)]
*  Thank you, Dalal, and thank you Ziad, Nada, and Mark for being part of this final installment [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=70.84s)]
*  of the series. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=77.76s)]
*  I just wanted to say a few words of thanks to Malte in particular and to the Konrad Adenauer [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=78.76s)]
*  for a great partnership on this series. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=84.36s)]
*  As you, as Dalal just outlined, this was a four-part series that was looking at the centennial [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=88.55999999999999s)]
*  reflections on Greater Lebanon. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  The first session was entitled Cutting the Gordian Knot of Lebanon's Power Sharing System, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=97.91999999999999s)]
*  and perhaps the biggest takeaway from that one was should we really be talking about [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  cutting or untangling the Gordian Knot and which one would help lead Lebanon safely out [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=110.28s)]
*  of the mess it's in and prevent a civil conflict. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=116.84s)]
*  The second came, the second panel was about what came after the Merchant's Republic, what [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=122.2s)]
*  comes after the Merchant's Republic, which really focused on the economy and the need [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=127.0s)]
*  for, actually it was interesting because the panel ended up focusing on the need for an [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=133.08s)]
*  independent government that is able to implement a short-term fiscal stabilization plan as [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=138.84s)]
*  well as put together the beginnings of a more forward-looking economic path vision for Lebanon. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=145.6s)]
*  And it took a lot, I mean they really did focus on how decisions on the economic front [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=154.83999999999997s)]
*  are being paralysed by politics, in a sense politics trumping and economics repeatedly. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=159.28s)]
*  The third panel was on security and freedom, something that we're seeing, there's a considerable [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=166.2s)]
*  concern in Lebanon today that once more people are being put, kind of are being asked to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=171.83999999999997s)]
*  choose between their security and their freedom. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=179.6s)]
*  I think one of the panelists said something that Lebanon is known as a justice by phone, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=182.92s)]
*  where public prosecutors and justice are really literally one phone call away from politicians. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  What was interesting is that there was also a note of hope, a glimmer of hope that came [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=194.52s)]
*  out of that particular panel and that focused on the attempts for judicial reform, the efforts [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=200.04s)]
*  by younger judges to de-politicize the judicial sector, but also to, you know, the efforts [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=206.92s)]
*  of NGOs like Legal Agenda and others to also push forward on judicial reform as a fundamental [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=216.52s)]
*  pillar for protecting press freedoms. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=224.04s)]
*  And today we're looking at the green economy turning black to green and the idea really [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=227.48s)]
*  is that if we want to move, you know, for Lebanon to survive for the next 100 years, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=233.84s)]
*  a fundamental and key pillar of any vision for the country has to be not only about preserving [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=239.64s)]
*  its environment, it's not just about enhancing it, but actually there are ways and I know [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  that some of you will be discussing this to make this, you know, how do we green our [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=252.56s)]
*  economy? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=257.04s)]
*  How do we enhance green economies? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=258.04s)]
*  How do we make sure existing sectors become greener, etc.? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=260.48s)]
*  I will end here. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=266.4s)]
*  Again, I want to thank the panelists today. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=267.4s)]
*  I want to thank Malte for a great partnership. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=269.6s)]
*  I'm sure there will be many more partnerships to come on other projects and thank you, Dalal, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=273.04s)]
*  for agreeing to moderate this session. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=278.12s)]
*  I'll be listening very closely. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=280.56s)]
*  Malte, over to you. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=283.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you very much, Maha. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=288.03999999999996s)]
*  Thank you, Dalal, Mark, Siyab, Nada. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=289.28s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining today and thank you, especially Maha. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=293.2s)]
*  You mentioned it already. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=296.56s)]
*  It was an interesting process of forming, conceptualizing our topics. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=298.0s)]
*  We first had the idea to mark the special day with one day full of different panels. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=305.76s)]
*  I think it was a good decision also to give it a little bit of time. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=313.24s)]
*  You would probably agree with many issues that have been discussed, like we really had [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=317.72s)]
*  and still have difficulties to follow up on what is happening in Lebanon. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=322.88s)]
*  I think this also marks at the same time the importance of the issues. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=330.44s)]
*  Not only looking back, but especially now looking forward. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=336.32s)]
*  Maha, you also mentioned it with a sense of hope. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=340.40000000000003s)]
*  I also have the feeling, like when also seeing the interactions between the audience, the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=344.92s)]
*  participants and the speakers. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=351.56s)]
*  From our side, today's title comes in a very timely manner. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=354.52s)]
*  As you know, the issue of building up green economies is of course also of high political [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=361.71999999999997s)]
*  importance in Europe, especially in Germany. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=370.52s)]
*  We ourselves are struggling with that issue or trying to find new innovative ways to combine [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=373.68s)]
*  a safe and clean ecosystem with economy and innovation. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=381.92s)]
*  I think this is also something where we would love to see more synergies between Europe and [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=389.44s)]
*  the region. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=394.68s)]
*  Every new innovation could also mean an economic win-win situation. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=397.96s)]
*  I think focusing on Lebanon, we would all agree that it is really a beautiful country. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=404.24s)]
*  In the case of Lebanon, today's topic becomes of significant importance. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=409.96s)]
*  Thank you very much again. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=417.28s)]
*  I think we will have a very productive talk today. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=420.23999999999995s)]
*  It was really our pleasure to support and cooperate with Carnegie on this series. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=423.96s)]
*  From my side, I wish you an interesting conversation. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=430.76s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=434.08s)]
*  Thank you, Malte. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=436.59999999999997s)]
*  I would like to first introduce our panel for today very briefly. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=437.68s)]
*  We are joined by Nada Zarour, who is the former president of the Lebanese Green Party, currently [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=443.28000000000003s)]
*  heads its arbitration council. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=450.24s)]
*  Nada is also a veteran environmental activist and she has extensively worked with non-governmental [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=452.44s)]
*  organizations mainly on deforestation and the protection of Lebanon's environment and [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=460.24s)]
*  natural resources. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=466.96s)]
*  Marc Ayoub joins us as well. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=467.96s)]
*  He's a researcher with the Isan Therese Institute at AUB in the program of energy policy and [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=472.28s)]
*  security. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=479.28s)]
*  He's also a chemical engineer. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=480.28s)]
*  And last but not least, Ziad Abishakir, who's a pioneer in the world of recycling in Lebanon [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=482.71999999999997s)]
*  and was really at the forefront during the garbage crisis in 2015. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=490.67999999999995s)]
*  He heads Cedar Environmental, doing really extraordinary work when it comes to recycling [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=496.2s)]
*  in this country. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=504.08s)]
*  I'm very happy to see Nada and Ziad because I've worked with both of them in the past [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=506.08s)]
*  as a journalist and as an environmental activist myself. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=510.76s)]
*  Nice to meet you, Marc, virtually. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=515.76s)]
*  So today's panel is entitled Turning Black into Green. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=518.68s)]
*  And I think the big question is, how do we make sure that the environment does not take [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=525.28s)]
*  a back seat in the national priorities of Lebanon amid the myriad of crises that the [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=530.28s)]
*  country is grappling with, especially this unprecedented economic and financial crisis? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=537.8399999999999s)]
*  I mean, in this context, the question remains, how do we survive? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=543.4799999999999s)]
*  As we all know today in Lebanon, we're talking about the survival mode and things only worsened [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=550.36s)]
*  after the explosion on August 4th. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=557.16s)]
*  How do we survive? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=560.12s)]
*  How do we save our economy but also protect the environment? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=561.12s)]
*  And how do we convince policymakers but also average citizens that the two are not mutually [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=565.52s)]
*  exclusive? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=572.0799999999999s)]
*  My first question is to Nada. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=574.56s)]
*  Nada, you're in a political party. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=576.0799999999999s)]
*  So when we're contextualizing this and what I just mentioned, how do we really convince [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=579.48s)]
*  people that the environment and economic growth are not mutually exclusive? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=586.44s)]
*  And do we need today a new economic vision for Lebanon, not only to get it out of the [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=591.56s)]
*  crisis because we need one to get out of this economic crisis, but also an economic vision [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=597.56s)]
*  that takes into consideration the sustainability of resources, a green economy and the protection [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=603.52s)]
*  of our environment? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=609.2s)]
*  Thank you, Dallal. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=610.2s)]
*  Also, it's good to meet all Ziyad and you. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=612.2s)]
*  We've been activists a long time ago. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=618.4s)]
*  Yeah, for the Green Party and as an activist and as a politician, what we need is a mature [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=622.76s)]
*  government to put on the priorities on their agenda, the environment. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=631.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, the climate movement is already preparing plans to relaunch a global vision [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=639.72s)]
*  of sustainability as a way to recover from the economic drop caused by COVID-19 all over [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=645.76s)]
*  the world. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=652.76s)]
*  And for us as a Green Party, we are trying to work on a vision as a long term vision [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=653.8s)]
*  to add it to the Lebanon economic and social development. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=662.8s)]
*  This vision needs to be integrated into the existing economic strategy of Lebanon. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=668.8s)]
*  You know, they have an economic strategy and we're trying to integrate with the government [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=675.8s)]
*  strategy. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=681.8s)]
*  So our plan is to make our people ready and we are trying to promote it in a way that [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=682.8399999999999s)]
*  this document will provide a general outline of current trends in energy and transportation, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=694.8399999999999s)]
*  in waste management, in agriculture, etc. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=700.8399999999999s)]
*  So what we need exactly, as I told you, a mature government, a mature responsible politicians [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=704.88s)]
*  to listen to what are the needs exactly for our future, what we want for our future, what [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=713.88s)]
*  we need for our coming generation. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=721.88s)]
*  So all these are shifting to the green economy. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=724.88s)]
*  When we say that we want to shift to a green economy, we are talking about good quality [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=730.92s)]
*  jobs. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=736.92s)]
*  It's not about that we like green or we are passionate about green or we are committed [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=738.92s)]
*  to green issues. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=745.92s)]
*  But what we are talking, it's really serious. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=747.92s)]
*  It's about the green economy that we provide a better future to the other generation. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=750.92s)]
*  So in our discussion, I can talk more about our plan in this strategy. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=758.9599999999999s)]
*  I can tell you more. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=765.9599999999999s)]
*  How can we create jobs? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=766.9599999999999s)]
*  How can we invest in funds that are really can help us and can be invested in good green [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=768.9599999999999s)]
*  initiatives? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=777.9599999999999s)]
*  Yes, we will go sector by sector. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=778.9599999999999s)]
*  Of course, we can't cover all the environmental and the green sectors here, but the main ones. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=781.9599999999999s)]
*  So just to summarize, the Green Party is going to offer whatever government is formed, hoping [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=786.0s)]
*  it's a mature government, a new economic vision that will integrate the environment and the [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=795.0s)]
*  green economy as a main component. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=801.0s)]
*  Now I'm going to go to Ziad Abishakir. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=805.0s)]
*  Ziad, we're nearing the one year anniversary of Lebanon's so-called uprising. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=808.0s)]
*  However, we want to label this an uprising, a revolution. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=815.04s)]
*  And to me, this uprising did not start in 2019 in October. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=818.04s)]
*  It had seeds and roots in August or in the summer of 2015 when people took to the streets [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=823.04s)]
*  protesting the garbage crisis and the mismanagement of way by the political class. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=830.04s)]
*  Five years on, unfortunately, we feel that not much has been done. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=837.04s)]
*  And again, you can correct me. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=843.0799999999999s)]
*  There's no comprehensive, sustainable, green waste management solution that is being implemented [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=845.0799999999999s)]
*  or enforced throughout the country. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=850.0799999999999s)]
*  And we feel it's been a piecemeal approach. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=854.0799999999999s)]
*  And as they say in Arabic, we've heard about landfills, you know, being their lifelines [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=856.0799999999999s)]
*  being extended. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=865.0799999999999s)]
*  We've heard about incinerators. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=866.0799999999999s)]
*  And there's a big question mark. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=868.0799999999999s)]
*  We can talk about this. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=871.0799999999999s)]
*  Ziad, has anything been done when it comes to the garbage crisis, which is a major problem [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=872.12s)]
*  today in Lebanon in those five years? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=877.12s)]
*  And if nothing has been done, why? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=880.12s)]
*  Well, of course, nothing has been done, because if anything has been done, we wouldn't be here [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=884.12s)]
*  right now. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=889.12s)]
*  We wouldn't be repeating the same mistakes we've been doing for the last 25 years or so. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=890.12s)]
*  Why nothing is being done? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=895.12s)]
*  Because it is the same mentality, the same approach of creating monopolies for political [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=897.16s)]
*  cronies. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=905.16s)]
*  The waste management file is ripe with corruption. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=907.16s)]
*  We all know that. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=912.16s)]
*  Everybody knows that. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=913.16s)]
*  The waste management file is the prime responsible for bankrupting our municipalities. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=915.16s)]
*  Now we are on the brink of a new waste crisis, but most of our municipalities, all of them, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=923.1999999999999s)]
*  basically all of them, are bankrupt. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=929.1999999999999s)]
*  They cannot, even if they want to do anything on their own, if they don't want to wait for [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=932.1999999999999s)]
*  politicians, they don't want to, they want to take charge in that aspect, they can't [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=939.1999999999999s)]
*  because their money is being plundered. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=946.1999999999999s)]
*  I will say plundered by the central government. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=950.24s)]
*  This is all due to the corrupt way of dealing with the waste management file. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=954.24s)]
*  Ziad, and this is a question also for Marc and Nada, so we can take turns. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=964.24s)]
*  There were a few things that were put on the table for resolving the garbage crisis. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=971.24s)]
*  There were quite comprehensive solutions put by NGOs, including some policy makers, but [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=977.28s)]
*  for some reasons we kept going back to incinerators. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=985.28s)]
*  And this was the only thing that the politicians were serious about. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=989.28s)]
*  This is the only thing that makes them money. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=995.28s)]
*  This is, you know, when you present them with a comprehensive solution and they insist yet [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=997.3199999999999s)]
*  again on installing incinerators, and we all know how prohibitive an incinerator cost is, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1005.3199999999999s)]
*  and we all know how prohibitive the operation of an incinerator is, and you see there was [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1012.3199999999999s)]
*  one point in time during the last crisis, practically every member of parliament was [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1021.36s)]
*  pushing the incineration agenda because they had some connection with some foreign companies [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1029.3600000000001s)]
*  who wanted to sell us incinerators. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1036.3600000000001s)]
*  I've sat with probably half of the parliament and half of them were pushing, you know, they [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1039.3600000000001s)]
*  were preaching to me that incineration was the best solution for the country. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1047.3999999999999s)]
*  Again, this is a question of political corruption. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1053.3999999999999s)]
*  It is not a question of, we're not lacking behind when it comes to technology or to research [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1057.3999999999999s)]
*  and development. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1064.3999999999999s)]
*  We are way up there with most of the other countries and we can solve this crisis environmentally. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1065.3999999999999s)]
*  Ziad, before I go to Mark, can you give us like very briefly the percentages of how much [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1072.44s)]
*  do we recycle and what is the potential that we're missing out on? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1079.44s)]
*  How much can we put in a sanitary landfill, et cetera? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1084.44s)]
*  Where are we today in terms of figures and numbers? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1089.44s)]
*  Because this could be an indication of what the potential is for solutions. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1092.44s)]
*  Sure. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1096.48s)]
*  First of all, I'm only talking about household waste, you know, the municipal solid waste, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1097.48s)]
*  what comes out of homes and hotels and restaurants and this kind of stuff. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1102.48s)]
*  I'm not talking about the other six categories of waste. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1107.48s)]
*  If we're just talking about municipal solid waste, the biggest chunk is food waste. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1111.48s)]
*  And food waste, you can, you know, you can put in a lot of waste. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1118.48s)]
*  And food waste, you can, you can make a very good quality compost out of it. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1123.52s)]
*  And now we are on the brink of famine because we need to grow more homegrown foods and homegrown [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1128.52s)]
*  foods need fertilizer and we're importing all this fertilizer. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1138.52s)]
*  So and now we cannot import it anymore because it has become prohibitively expensive. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1143.52s)]
*  So any any sound plan would look at our municipal solid waste and say, listen, 70 percent of our waste is organic. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1148.56s)]
*  We have to turn it into a high quality compost. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1160.56s)]
*  Let's put in all the right parameters so that we value, we make it more valuable as a raw material [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1163.56s)]
*  and we produce a higher end fertilizer. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1171.56s)]
*  And then we can at least solve our own food shortages locally. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1174.6s)]
*  We have plenty of other plastics have become widely available in the waste stream. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1181.6s)]
*  And the immediate, if you want the immediate injection of hard currency would be to export recyclables. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1190.6s)]
*  Now there are many companies that work with me and they export PET flakes. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1200.6399999999999s)]
*  This is the the plastic of plastic bottles and soda bottles. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1205.6399999999999s)]
*  And this is why it is imperative that we put on a sorting at source national strategy. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1211.6399999999999s)]
*  We create as many sorting centers around the territory as possible so that all these raw materials can end up being exported [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1220.6399999999999s)]
*  instead of ending up being land trade. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1229.68s)]
*  Mike, I want to go back to you with the issue of incinerators, because you're an energy expert and what the politicians have been. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1235.68s)]
*  You're muted. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1245.68s)]
*  Sorry, can you hear me now? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1247.68s)]
*  So the politicians keep using the word waste to energy, referring or alluding indirectly to incinerators, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1249.72s)]
*  which in my understanding is something completely different as not always the same. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1258.72s)]
*  Is there a capacity in Lebanon to use waste to turn it into energy? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1263.72s)]
*  I mean, the landfill in Nami is sometimes referred to when it comes to that issue. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1269.72s)]
*  Of course there is. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1276.76s)]
*  And here I echo like what Ziad has just mentioned regarding the incinerator. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1278.76s)]
*  And I would like just to add on that from a government's perspective, like the waste or the solid waste management [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1283.76s)]
*  has been one aspect or one pillar of what we have been called the cost of corruption in Lebanon. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1290.76s)]
*  Like as long as we are going into this array of corruption, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1297.8s)]
*  like we cannot go or look into other solutions that bring just money for the political elite or for the surrounding people around them. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1304.8s)]
*  So on your question, yes, we have the example of Nami that has been producing around seven megawatts from waste to energy. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1314.8s)]
*  And it has been made and done according to the highest international standards. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1323.84s)]
*  And I think it could even produce more and use much more from the waste that has been used there. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1331.84s)]
*  On another hand, like we are facing, as Ziad has mentioned, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1338.84s)]
*  we are facing now another crisis in the near future regarding the quarantine or the Jadidah Bashamud dump [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1343.84s)]
*  and also the Costa Brava thing. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1352.8799999999999s)]
*  So even before the decision or the recent decision that has been made to extend or enlarge the quarantine dump, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1354.8799999999999s)]
*  there has been recent studies by the CNRS, the National Center for Remote Sensing, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1363.8799999999999s)]
*  as well as the Lumi Foundation for Renewable Energy on the quarantine dump or the Jadidah. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1368.8799999999999s)]
*  And here some results of this study has shown that we can produce. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1372.8799999999999s)]
*  And here it's something that is like recent and exclusive to this, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1377.92s)]
*  that if we use the solar energy on top of those, we can even produce for Beirut area. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1384.92s)]
*  And this has been done post the Beirut blast. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1389.92s)]
*  We can produce around 50 megawatts only from the quarantine or the Jadidah dump [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1392.92s)]
*  using around 490,000 square meters of the areas that have been covered with waste. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1399.96s)]
*  So yes, of course we can. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1408.96s)]
*  And there is a huge opportunity to turn this black, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1410.96s)]
*  like if we can use the title of our panel today, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1413.96s)]
*  and that, of course, Ziad can elaborate more on into something green. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1419.96s)]
*  So of course there is an opportunity and we should be benefiting from this [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1423.96s)]
*  rather than keeping it, seeing our sea like this area covered by waste [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1429.0s)]
*  and being extended year after year. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1436.0s)]
*  Thank you, Mike. Nada, I have a question for you. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1440.0s)]
*  Five years ago, I mean, I covered a bit the recycling industries in Lebanon. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1444.0s)]
*  There aren't that many because of all the constraints and there are no incentives. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1450.0s)]
*  But is there potential for recycling, more recycling industries, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1455.04s)]
*  companies that would create jobs and help with the crisis [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1460.04s)]
*  and what is needed to encourage these companies? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1466.04s)]
*  I mean, in the past few years, we've seen more and more and more initiatives, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1471.04s)]
*  but what is needed here to have more of that? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1474.04s)]
*  Yeah, before answering your question, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1478.04s)]
*  I want to make sure that there is no more money for the incinerators. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1480.08s)]
*  All the funding, I'm doubt and I'm surely doubt that they will be spent on incinerators. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1485.08s)]
*  Let's look about the busy and let's look about the positive way how busy is top. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1492.08s)]
*  So I don't think incinerators will be the solution. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1499.08s)]
*  So we are going back to the to the pyramid of recycling [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1503.12s)]
*  that we are purchasing in our daily life. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1509.12s)]
*  What what we have exactly and what we are [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1514.12s)]
*  injecting in our paper for the economy, sustainable economic paper [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1519.12s)]
*  that the supercharged plan for a strong local recycling industry [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1526.12s)]
*  by building recycling factories. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1531.1599999999999s)]
*  This is the most important and what Ziyad was saying [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1534.1599999999999s)]
*  and developing innovative ways to use recycled materials. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1537.1599999999999s)]
*  So in our paper, this would create ongoing manufacturing transport [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1542.1599999999999s)]
*  and constructions, jobs and help us protect our oceans, rivers and environment, etc. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1547.1599999999999s)]
*  So what I am saying, it is possible and achievable. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1553.1599999999999s)]
*  We can redirect the funds from damaging unnecessary [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1557.2s)]
*  and expensive projects, as I said, like Bisri. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1562.2s)]
*  Now we are witnessing a crime, an environmental crime in Jadadi, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1567.2s)]
*  Sad and Bush Hamoud enlarging the landfill by 40,000 meters square. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1572.2s)]
*  So they are not listening. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1580.2s)]
*  They are taking the things that they are because they are corrupted [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1582.2s)]
*  and they are looking for other resources. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1586.24s)]
*  Everything they are like Dracula taking the money from [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1589.24s)]
*  from all the municipalities. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1594.24s)]
*  This is really bad, but it's not going to continue. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1597.24s)]
*  There is no money for them anymore. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1600.24s)]
*  Khalas episode. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1602.24s)]
*  This is the final episode. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1603.24s)]
*  I am sure about it. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1606.24s)]
*  And I'm very excited to watch this final episode, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1608.24s)]
*  the last episode of this criminals, what they are doing to our country. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1611.28s)]
*  Ziad, thank you, Nada. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1616.28s)]
*  To build on what Nada said, based on your experience, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1619.28s)]
*  what are two or three things we need to do to encourage [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1624.28s)]
*  the growth of recycling industries? [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1628.28s)]
*  I am assuming that consumer and household behavior is crucial [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1631.28s)]
*  because you need this recycling material to get to these industries. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1635.28s)]
*  And unfortunately, maybe this culture is being built, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1640.32s)]
*  but we're still not there at the household level. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1644.32s)]
*  But you need to start probably two or three steps above the household [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1649.32s)]
*  is you need to put in the administrative framework [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1655.32s)]
*  and the administrative framework to get out of the garbage crisis [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1659.32s)]
*  is to fully embrace decentralization [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1663.32s)]
*  We have 26 administrative regions in this country. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1669.36s)]
*  We should approach the waste management plan [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1673.36s)]
*  by saying each administrative area, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1677.36s)]
*  that is, Qadha, is responsible for their own waste management. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1680.36s)]
*  Once you break it down, you don't have to create those mega landfills [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1685.36s)]
*  that now we are seeing. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1690.36s)]
*  So you break it down onto the administrative area, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1692.36s)]
*  administrative region, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1696.36s)]
*  and then you empower municipalities. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1698.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, if anyone is listening now, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1701.3999999999999s)]
*  the only way we can get out of the crisis, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1703.3999999999999s)]
*  40,000 square meters of an expanding landfill [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1707.3999999999999s)]
*  will only give us six months' time. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1711.3999999999999s)]
*  That's it. Six to eight months. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1714.3999999999999s)]
*  Six to eight months is not even enough [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1717.3999999999999s)]
*  to lay down the infrastructure for Qadha al-Matin [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1720.3999999999999s)]
*  to have its own recycling facility for Qasr Wain, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1725.44s)]
*  for Qadha al-Gharata. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1729.44s)]
*  We need time to lay down those infrastructures [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1732.44s)]
*  and we need money. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1737.44s)]
*  What I'm working on right now is to bypass government funding [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1739.44s)]
*  and to go directly to international donors [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1744.44s)]
*  and work on scenarios where those international donors [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1748.44s)]
*  with the Union of Municipalities [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1752.48s)]
*  and people from the private sector [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1754.48s)]
*  who are willing to assume full responsibility [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1757.48s)]
*  for the success of the project [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1760.48s)]
*  to at least give a prototype model of what should be done. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1762.48s)]
*  And one part, to come back to your household parameter, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1767.48s)]
*  one part of that plan, once you adopt decentralization, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1773.48s)]
*  you have to make way. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1778.48s)]
*  You take away all the garbage bins from the streets. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1780.52s)]
*  You stop allowing people to dump their garbage [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1785.52s)]
*  in bins on the streets. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1789.52s)]
*  You adopt a plan where the municipality goes door to door [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1791.52s)]
*  and collects waste from households. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1796.52s)]
*  And they will ask you to sort your waste in two bags only. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1800.52s)]
*  One for organics and Kleenex and baby diapers [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1805.52s)]
*  and what have you, and the other one for everything else, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1809.56s)]
*  plastic, glass, metals. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1813.56s)]
*  And if they come to you to collect the waste [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1815.56s)]
*  and you have not sorted them properly, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1819.56s)]
*  the first couple of times they will say, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1822.56s)]
*  listen, we cannot take this, you need to re-sort it again [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1825.56s)]
*  and then we can take it back. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1828.56s)]
*  If you insist on not sorting your garbage, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1830.56s)]
*  then the municipality has the right to fine you. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1833.56s)]
*  Take the garbage. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1836.56s)]
*  And then once you have control on the source of material, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1839.56s)]
*  you leave it to the industrious Lebanese population [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1843.56s)]
*  who will always find ways to come up with good... [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1849.56s)]
*  And there are successful recycling industries in Lebanon. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1856.56s)]
*  I mean, few, but there are, and the work you have done. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1861.56s)]
*  I don't want to... [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1864.56s)]
*  I just shared with you a huge list of... [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1865.56s)]
*  Yes, the list. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1868.6s)]
*  Yes, and there are also initiatives [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1869.6s)]
*  who are doing the role of the mediator [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1871.6s)]
*  taking the recycle, like Recycle Lebanon and others. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1873.6s)]
*  I don't want to stay too long on the waste management issue, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1878.6s)]
*  although it's a very big file and it's very important. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1881.6s)]
*  And I feel sorry because I've covered this issue for five years [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1885.6s)]
*  and I'm hearing you, Ziad, now say what you said five years ago [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1889.6s)]
*  and nothing has been done. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1893.6s)]
*  Nothing has been done. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1895.6399999999999s)]
*  It's really frustrating. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1897.6399999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately, the waste management crisis [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1900.6399999999999s)]
*  and the garbage crisis has aggravated another problem, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1903.6399999999999s)]
*  which is water, pollution of water. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1909.6399999999999s)]
*  And I will go to Mark about this. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1913.6399999999999s)]
*  In Lebanon, when it comes to the water sector, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1916.6399999999999s)]
*  we have two problems. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1918.6399999999999s)]
*  One that is the management of water supply. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1920.6399999999999s)]
*  People wonder how come in a country like Lebanon, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1923.68s)]
*  households still need to buy water [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1926.68s)]
*  to cater for their daily needs. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1929.68s)]
*  So there's a water management problem. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1934.68s)]
*  It feels like the supply is not enough, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1936.68s)]
*  although it's supposed to be enough. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1938.68s)]
*  And then there's a quality problem. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1941.68s)]
*  The water is polluted [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1943.68s)]
*  and the garbage crisis has contributed to that, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1946.68s)]
*  but we also have the sewage system. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1949.68s)]
*  That is another issue, tons of problems. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1951.72s)]
*  So, Mark, how would you describe [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1953.72s)]
*  the water sector situation today? [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1957.72s)]
*  What are the issues at stake [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1960.72s)]
*  and what do you think is the solution? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1962.72s)]
*  So I can look at this in a combined, if you want, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1966.72s)]
*  or dual aspect. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1970.72s)]
*  So we have the water and the wastewater [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1971.72s)]
*  that are connected in a way or another [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1974.72s)]
*  and also an additional layer [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1977.72s)]
*  that comes at the top of this [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1979.76s)]
*  and exacerbates this problem [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1981.76s)]
*  is the energy as well for water [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1983.76s)]
*  and service provision. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1985.76s)]
*  So for water and wastewater service provision. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1986.76s)]
*  So as we, like many of us know, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1990.76s)]
*  we have in the new law [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1993.76s)]
*  regarding the water, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1996.76s)]
*  the four water establishment [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1998.76s)]
*  that are trying to get their [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=1999.76s)]
*  independency or monad [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2001.76s)]
*  and to work under the supervision [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2002.76s)]
*  of the ministry in order to [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2005.76s)]
*  supply or present this water service [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2007.8s)]
*  to the citizen. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2010.8s)]
*  But we are facing here several technical [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2011.8s)]
*  and also a mentality [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2015.8s)]
*  from the citizen side as well. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2018.8s)]
*  So if we want to start from the technical, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2020.8s)]
*  we know the connections [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2022.8s)]
*  and all the network that we had, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2025.8s)]
*  the old network that we have here in Lebanon [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2027.8s)]
*  and just one number, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2030.8s)]
*  like half of what is generated [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2033.8s)]
*  or half of the water that is pumped [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2035.84s)]
*  is lost on the way before reaching the citizens. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2038.84s)]
*  So around 50% we call non-revenue water [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2042.84s)]
*  and this number has a range [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2045.84s)]
*  like depending on the areas, on the region. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2047.84s)]
*  But let's assume like this. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2049.84s)]
*  So 50% is lost is non-revenue. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2051.84s)]
*  Sorry, why? [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2053.84s)]
*  Because of how old the networks are [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2054.84s)]
*  that haven't been changed? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2055.84s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2056.84s)]
*  And on the other hand, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2058.84s)]
*  there is also a mentality like [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2060.84s)]
*  and this comes at the top of the water [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2062.84s)]
*  and this comes again to the finding [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2064.88s)]
*  or how the billing system is done [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2066.88s)]
*  that Ziad has just mentioned on the waste sector. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2068.88s)]
*  But we also think or people think [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2071.88s)]
*  of the water as granted [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2075.88s)]
*  or take water as granted. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2077.88s)]
*  So we don't usually use the energy, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2079.88s)]
*  the water efficiently. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2082.88s)]
*  And as long as there is water, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2084.88s)]
*  they think that this is available all the time [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2086.88s)]
*  and as many quantity as we want. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2089.88s)]
*  So this is something that also needs [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2092.92s)]
*  to be worked on and awareness [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2094.92s)]
*  on how to efficiently use our water resources [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2096.92s)]
*  because the way we are moving today [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2100.92s)]
*  is towards another crisis [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2103.92s)]
*  in a decade or two [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2107.92s)]
*  and we will be facing shortages [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2109.92s)]
*  in water supply to the cities, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2111.92s)]
*  to the main cities [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2114.92s)]
*  and to the Beirut area specifically. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2115.92s)]
*  So and on top of this, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2117.92s)]
*  we have the energy like the energy crisis [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2120.96s)]
*  that also exacerbates the water. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2123.96s)]
*  So today if EDL, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2125.96s)]
*  if the water establishments [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2127.96s)]
*  are not paying EDL their bills [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2129.96s)]
*  and they are not paying [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2131.96s)]
*  for the electricity they are using [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2132.96s)]
*  and EDL cannot demand [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2134.96s)]
*  from those water establishments [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2136.96s)]
*  to pay their bills. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2138.96s)]
*  So how can those water establishments sustain [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2139.96s)]
*  and how can we speak about like [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2143.96s)]
*  remove those losses from the EDL [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2147.0s)]
*  if you want numbers or EDL budget. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2151.0s)]
*  So this is really correlated [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2155.0s)]
*  but we see a lot [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2157.0s)]
*  and we have worked here a lot [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2158.0s)]
*  over the past two years on energy efficiency [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2159.0s)]
*  in water and wastewater services. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2162.0s)]
*  So wastewater is really an untapped sector [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2164.0s)]
*  where we have a lot of loss potential [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2167.0s)]
*  in terms of water reuse [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2170.0s)]
*  and treatment of wastewater. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2171.0s)]
*  So imagine as well [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2173.0s)]
*  all of the wastewater [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2175.04s)]
*  are sent to our sea [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2176.04s)]
*  and specifically on the shore [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2178.04s)]
*  and in the main cities. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2181.04s)]
*  So we have a limited number [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2183.04s)]
*  of wastewater treatment plants [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2185.04s)]
*  in Lebanon and even if [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2187.04s)]
*  they are fully operational [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2190.04s)]
*  they are not like [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2192.04s)]
*  the process is not really working [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2194.04s)]
*  as needed because not all of the villages [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2196.04s)]
*  or all of the cities [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2199.04s)]
*  are connected to those [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2200.04s)]
*  wastewater treatment networks. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2201.04s)]
*  So this is a combined [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2203.08s)]
*  if you want problem [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2205.08s)]
*  we cannot look at water alone [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2206.08s)]
*  without looking at the wastewater [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2208.08s)]
*  and how we can benefit [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2210.08s)]
*  from this wastewater [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2211.08s)]
*  and on top of that [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2212.08s)]
*  there is the energy crisis [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2214.08s)]
*  that is exacerbating this [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2215.08s)]
*  on all sectors [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2217.08s)]
*  and not only on water alone. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2218.08s)]
*  Nada what about water pollution [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2221.08s)]
*  whatever water we are getting [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2224.08s)]
*  I mean we hear a lot [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2226.08s)]
*  that the water is polluted [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2228.08s)]
*  our sea is polluted [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2229.08s)]
*  the water that we get [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2230.08s)]
*  in our households [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2231.08s)]
*  is polluted [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2232.12s)]
*  is this related to [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2235.12s)]
*  the sewage networks [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2237.12s)]
*  is this related to the garbage crisis [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2238.12s)]
*  what is the problem [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2240.12s)]
*  when it comes to the quality [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2241.12s)]
*  of the water that we are getting? [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2243.12s)]
*  It's the infrastructure [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2245.12s)]
*  it's all about the infrastructure [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2247.12s)]
*  and plus the citizen [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2249.12s)]
*  is responsible too [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2252.12s)]
*  we are not concerned [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2254.12s)]
*  as if we are living in a [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2256.12s)]
*  you know in a small hub [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2259.12s)]
*  and all around us [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2260.16s)]
*  everything around us [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2262.16s)]
*  we are not responsible [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2263.16s)]
*  it's all depending on [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2264.16s)]
*  on the government [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2266.16s)]
*  the government has its responsibility [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2267.16s)]
*  but when we throw our sewage [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2269.16s)]
*  garbage or the [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2272.16s)]

*  into the Bistri dam [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2423.36s)]

*  in India [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2437.4s)]

*  a green solution [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2449.4s)]

*  are also putting them on a table [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2452.4s)]

*  yes [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2466.44s)]
*  dams in the water sector [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2469.44s)]

*  of the waste management sector [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2474.44s)]
*  yeah [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2476.44s)]
*  okay [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2477.44s)]
*  it's a way [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2478.44s)]
*  to just make money [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2479.44s)]
*  by pouring cement [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2480.44s)]

*  for political croonies [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2484.44s)]
*  and what really pisses you off completely [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2486.48s)]
*  is that [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2490.48s)]
*  we move from one failed dam [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2491.48s)]
*  to another [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2494.48s)]
*  and yet another [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2496.48s)]
*  we've built so far [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2497.48s)]
*  how many? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2499.48s)]
*  starting with the Brisa [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2500.48s)]
*  with the Brisa dam [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2502.48s)]
*  that cost 13 million dollars at the time [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2503.48s)]
*  did not even [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2506.48s)]
*  gather 13 litres of water [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2509.48s)]
*  and then we kept on building dams [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2513.48s)]
*  and all the geologists are saying [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2515.52s)]
*  stop building dams [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2518.52s)]
*  the land that we live on [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2520.52s)]
*  the nature of this land [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2523.52s)]
*  the geological nature of this land [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2525.52s)]

*  you are lucky that [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2529.52s)]
*  we live on a surface [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2530.52s)]
*  that filters water through [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2532.52s)]
*  and you are living on the largest water basin [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2535.52s)]
*  in this whole area [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2540.52s)]
*  so start investing [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2542.56s)]
*  in smart Cartesian wells [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2545.56s)]
*  and stop wasting [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2548.56s)]
*  and plundering public funds [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2551.56s)]
*  for failed projects [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2554.56s)]
*  that's it [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2558.56s)]
*  this is all I'm gonna say about water [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2559.56s)]
*  Amir, Nader, you want to add anything about the dams [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2560.56s)]
*  because this is the last topic in the water sector [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2563.56s)]
*  I want to move to another sector [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2565.56s)]
*  Nader, you are mute [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2569.56s)]
*  can you unmute yourself please [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2570.6s)]
*  I agree with Shekhar and with Ziad [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2573.6s)]
*  what I'm saying that as a green global [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2578.6s)]
*  global members [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2583.6s)]
*  in all over the world [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2585.6s)]
*  they are against the dam [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2586.6s)]
*  in all over the world [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2588.6s)]
*  because the dam they execute them [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2590.6s)]
*  in 50 years [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2592.6s)]
*  after 50 years [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2593.6s)]
*  so all the money that they are investing in dams [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2594.6s)]
*  it looks that they are not getting proper water [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2598.64s)]
*  the water needs more filtering [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2602.64s)]
*  and it costs a lot [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2605.64s)]
*  so for them [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2607.64s)]
*  they reach to a solution [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2609.64s)]
*  that the dams are not the right way [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2611.64s)]
*  to keep or save water [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2614.64s)]
*  from the [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2617.64s)]
*  for the other seasons [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2619.64s)]
*  so dams for all over the world [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2620.64s)]
*  they execute all the dams after 50 years [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2624.64s)]
*  so what we are saying in Balaa [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2627.68s)]
*  they are keeping [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2630.68s)]
*  dumping the cements in this Belua [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2631.68s)]
*  to try to cover the land for it [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2635.68s)]
*  and they couldn't [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2640.68s)]
*  so there is no study [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2641.68s)]
*  it's corruption everywhere [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2643.68s)]
*  in every detail [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2644.68s)]
*  there is corruption [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2646.68s)]
*  and that's what you're facing here [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2647.68s)]
*  not to mention that most of these dams are [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2649.68s)]
*  the environmental assessment [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2652.68s)]
*  the impact assessment is done [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2654.68s)]
*  by the same contractor company [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2656.72s)]
*  there is conflict of interest [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2658.72s)]
*  which we've also seen [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2660.72s)]
*  in other sectors [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2663.72s)]
*  so now I want to move to power [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2665.72s)]
*  and energy [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2669.72s)]
*  and to alternative energy [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2670.72s)]
*  and I think this is the specialty of Marc [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2672.72s)]
*  and I will give you some time [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2674.72s)]
*  to talk about this [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2676.72s)]
*  but maybe Marc [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2677.72s)]
*  as Zia did with the waste management [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2678.72s)]
*  can you map the situation today [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2681.72s)]
*  in terms of the usage [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2684.7599999999998s)]
*  and production of alternative green energy [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2686.7599999999998s)]
*  and what the potential is [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2690.7599999999998s)]
*  sure [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2694.7599999999998s)]
*  so just allow me to take few minutes [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2695.7599999999998s)]
*  to explain to all who are listening to us today [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2697.7599999999998s)]
*  about the current situation [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2701.7599999999998s)]
*  and what are like [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2703.7599999999998s)]
*  when we speak about [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2704.7599999999998s)]
*  really about the topic of this session [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2705.7599999999998s)]
*  is how to turn black to green [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2707.7599999999998s)]
*  so when we speak about black [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2709.7599999999998s)]
*  I can list three main aspects [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2711.8s)]
*  of this black [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2713.8s)]
*  we are speaking about [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2715.8s)]
*  so first is the economy [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2716.8s)]
*  or the economic aspect of it [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2718.8s)]
*  and here I am speaking about [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2720.8s)]
*  the impact of the financial crisis [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2722.8s)]
*  we are living [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2724.8s)]
*  on the citizens access to electricity [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2725.8s)]
*  and the electricity services [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2728.8s)]
*  and here also [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2731.8s)]
*  when I speak about this [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2734.8s)]
*  we can [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2735.8s)]
*  this is meant by the drop in dollars [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2736.8s)]
*  in foreign currencies [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2740.84s)]
*  and the inability of the BDL [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2742.84s)]
*  or the central bank [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2745.84s)]
*  to continue supporting the import [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2746.84s)]
*  of such fuel [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2749.84s)]
*  the heavy fuel oil [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2750.84s)]
*  and diesel oil for the ADL [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2752.84s)]
*  and the same time [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2755.84s)]
*  in parallel [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2756.84s)]
*  we have [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2757.84s)]
*  this shortage in liquidity [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2758.84s)]
*  is reflected as well [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2760.84s)]
*  at the level of the owners [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2761.84s)]
*  of the diesel generators [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2763.84s)]
*  or private diesel generators [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2764.84s)]
*  so they are really having several challenges [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2766.84s)]
*  and extreme challenges [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2768.88s)]
*  in accessing also funds [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2770.88s)]
*  to get their diesel as well [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2772.88s)]
*  so this is on the economic part [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2774.88s)]
*  second is on the technical [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2776.88s)]
*  and here when I mean technical [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2778.88s)]
*  we have this unmet demand [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2779.88s)]
*  we have this deficit [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2781.88s)]
*  and shortage in generation [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2782.88s)]
*  and we have lived [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2784.88s)]
*  during this summer in July [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2785.88s)]
*  or around the end of July [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2787.88s)]
*  this almost complete blackout [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2788.88s)]
*  in electricity supply [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2790.88s)]
*  like around 20 [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2792.88s)]
*  over 24 hours of complete blackout [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2793.88s)]
*  and this is mainly due [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2796.88s)]
*  to the incapacity [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2797.92s)]
*  of the current [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2798.92s)]
*  also first [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2799.92s)]
*  the inaccessibility to the fuel [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2800.92s)]
*  and second [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2802.92s)]
*  the old [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2803.92s)]
*  and the producing also power plants [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2806.92s)]
*  EDL power plants [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2808.92s)]
*  the third aspect [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2810.92s)]
*  and this is like [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2811.92s)]
*  one key pillar as well [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2812.92s)]
*  and it is part of our discussion [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2815.92s)]
*  is the environmental [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2816.92s)]
*  and health cost of it [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2817.92s)]
*  like a recent study [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2819.92s)]
*  from the Greenpeace [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2820.92s)]
*  has placed Lebanon [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2821.92s)]
*  along with Egypt [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2823.92s)]
*  as one of the highest [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2824.92s)]
*  countries in the Middle East [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2826.96s)]
*  and North Africa [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2827.96s)]
*  and the MENA region [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2828.96s)]
*  with premature death [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2829.96s)]
*  caused by the use of fossil fuels [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2831.96s)]
*  and here when we say about [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2833.96s)]
*  if we want to see [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2835.96s)]
*  tell numbers [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2837.96s)]
*  we can speak about [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2838.96s)]
*  1800 to 4200 death [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2839.96s)]
*  in 2018 [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2844.96s)]
*  caused by this [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2845.96s)]
*  use of fossil fuels [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2846.96s)]
*  and of premature death [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2848.96s)]
*  so [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2849.96s)]
*  three main aspects of this black [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2850.96s)]
*  and on top of that [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2853.96s)]
*  like the Beirut blast [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2854.96s)]
*  Beirut blast on August 4th [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2856.0s)]
*  came as a devastating event [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2857.0s)]
*  to which [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2859.0s)]
*  we could not like continue [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2860.0s)]
*  the same in the same way [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2862.0s)]
*  after that [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2864.0s)]
*  so the recent also report [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2865.0s)]
*  by the World Bank [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=2867.0s)]

*  these initiatives [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3597.96s)]
*  what can we do [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3598.96s)]
*  so can you briefly [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3599.96s)]
*  talk about this [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3600.96s)]
*  listen [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3601.96s)]
*  of course [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3602.96s)]
*  you know [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3603.96s)]
*  there are a lot of people [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3604.96s)]
*  all over the country [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3605.96s)]
*  problem is they need support first of all and the major obstacle here is the municipalities. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3606.96s)]
*  They need to own this file and they need to be a bit more proactive in dealing with the waste in [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3616.08s)]
*  their own areas and unfortunately most of our municipalities are an extension of the political [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3626.2400000000002s)]
*  parties that are an extension of the politicians and that showcase a major incompetencies and [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3634.8s)]
*  ineptitude and what have you. So now you have a lot of private citizen or civil society initiatives [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3642.88s)]
*  that are working but for them to be sustainable in the long run they need to be financially viable [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3653.44s)]
*  and to be financially viable then there is a parameter of industry that needs to be involved [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3660.4s)]
*  there is a parameter of circularity. I mean you can go collect as much plastic as you want from an [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3667.1200000000003s)]
*  area if you cannot find an outlet for them that's gonna pay you back to offset a bit of the cost of [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3674.8s)]
*  of doing this exercise eventually it's gonna stop. This is why adopting decentralization and [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3682.64s)]
*  empowering municipalities to at least I don't want to say assume full responsibility for these [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3691.12s)]
*  actions but at least help support the local initiatives that are being done in their municipal [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3700.96s)]
*  constructions then there is hope there is hope and I've seen a lot of initiative doing [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3707.84s)]
*  wonderful work wonderful work you know especially sorting at source and collecting recyclables and [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3718.32s)]
*  channeling them to the various recycling or conversion. Can you repeat the initiative like [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3724.88s)]
*  four or five initiatives maybe you know that people can check them out? [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3729.44s)]
*  Check them out. Yeah like association L'Ecoute they are doing a good job [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3734.0s)]
*  Arc'en Ciel is doing a good job I've seen a lot of initiatives in the Chouf area [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3740.72s)]
*  also that are collecting recyclables there's always there's also Choua Al-Dia and see this [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3748.88s)]
*  for care there's plenty of players trying to do as much as they can within their means [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3757.84s)]
*  but it remains it remains outside the legal framework or the administrative framework if [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3766.4s)]
*  you want that what that we are hoping for. The last question Nada since you're back I wanted to [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3774.8s)]
*  ask that earlier but we lost you and this is a topic that I personally think is very important [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3780.2400000000002s)]
*  is deforestation and Lebanon losing its green spaces I mean we have less and less green spaces [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3787.7599999999998s)]
*  we've seen the fires last year unfortunately the ravaging fires the unbelievable absence of response [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3796.16s)]
*  from the government and the authorities what can be done today to protect what is left of Lebanon's [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3805.44s)]
*  green spaces and can you hear me now Nada? No she cannot hear me. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3813.6s)]
*  Okay let me maybe I can type this and you can answer it so I'm okay [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3825.8399999999997s)]
*  Okay do you want to tune off and then try again disconnect and connect maybe [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3836.1600000000003s)]
*  No still no I'm typing okay [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3848.6400000000003s)]
*  Okay unfortunately we don't have Nada with us. Nada try to unmute yourself. She can hear us. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3855.1200000000003s)]
*  She's you're muted but it's the microphone I think has nothing to do with her microphone is [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3862.6400000000003s)]
*  not working. Yes she's having electricity and connection problems which is another [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3868.7200000000003s)]
*  big issue the connection in this country is a big problem. If she's back and she can hear us maybe [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3875.28s)]
*  I'll ask her I don't know if Ziad or Mike you want to talk about this the issue of green spaces, [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3883.28s)]
*  deforestation, fires, the lack of response, the lack of protection. I mean Lebanon used to be [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3890.24s)]
*  labeled as a green country, it's a myth at least personally to me when I go around in Europe or [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3897.12s)]
*  other places even. What can be done? I mean this is the last topic I want to discuss before we wrap it up. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3904.7999999999997s)]
*  Well again I mean if we have good urban planning and then there was a national plan on the uses [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3912.32s)]
*  of land and how this government and this country and this state should be managing its green spaces. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3920.48s)]
*  Now forest fires are a thing of nature you know but also it can be man-made and I've seen a lot [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3929.1200000000003s)]
*  of studies now coming where they tie wastewater management to combating forest fires where [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3937.52s)]
*  whenever they have wastewater stations they always they don't dump the water in rivers [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3947.52s)]
*  they take them and they fill them in reservoirs where they have quick access to forests. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3954.4s)]
*  So in case you have any kind of fire going on you can use that treated water immediately like they [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3962.56s)]
*  have waterways running in the forest. I've seen in Turkey where they built roads just for their [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3970.32s)]
*  fire vehicles where they can hook up to those reservoirs and then they can drive through the [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3977.6s)]
*  forest and then they can sprinkle water all over. It's not rocket science you know it's [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3984.08s)]
*  all a matter of. As you mentioned it's nature but the response also makes a big difference. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3989.6s)]
*  Nada this was a question to you but unfortunately we lost you. We're talking about deforestation. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=3994.3199999999997s)]
*  I know this is how you initially started in environmental activism and I was saying that [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4000.0s)]
*  unfortunately I feel like we're losing day after day whatever is left of Lebanon's [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4006.72s)]
*  green spaces deforestation fires are a big problem. What is the problem? [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4012.0s)]
*  What is the solution today to protect what is left of Lebanon's forests and green spaces [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4018.0s)]
*  and can that solution include the creation of jobs again going back to the green economy? [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4025.76s)]
*  Yeah of course restoring our natural resources would create thousands of jobs for regional [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4031.36s)]
*  communities and young people but how can we help? We need the law to protect us. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4040.48s)]
*  Without a law we can't. Let's say we want to implement the law to make it really a [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4048.48s)]
*  a fact law. So if we don't implement our law we have many laws in the environmental law [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4064.48s)]
*  but it's not implemented. What we need of course we need the people to be [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4073.52s)]
*  wise enough that these resources it's for them and they should protect it. Let's see what's [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4080.56s)]
*  happening in Bisri the last week. It was really the fireworks they [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4087.68s)]
*  make it. It's a crime. It's a crime all over the world so we can't turn our face about the [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4097.12s)]
*  responsibility of the local citizens about the farmers about the municipality. These should be [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4104.64s)]
*  in the time of fire and the seasons of fire between July and November we should be all alert. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4111.76s)]
*  So we need an education at the end and there is many labs like in Balaman. We know there is a [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4119.76s)]
*  fire lab that we are it's connected to the municipality and you can see the hot areas [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4127.4400000000005s)]
*  the hot zones it can give you that this is our risky in this time. It depends where are you [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4133.12s)]
*  and which or any governor. So to interrupt do we have today the means to respond to these fires? [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4140.16s)]
*  We know that there were no no actually we don't. No no no we have a problem with the civil defense. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4147.68s)]
*  They need the volunteers. They need the we have only around the five thousand volunteers and they [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4155.5199999999995s)]
*  are coming on their own. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4163.44s)]
*  These rights for a long time. Yeah and we were putting for them yes exactly and there is only 500 [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4169.28s)]
*  you know administrative issue that they can't do anything behind their desks and who is fighting [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4178.16s)]
*  on the ground. They are youth and young and they need all the equipments to fight the fire. They [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4184.48s)]
*  are on the front line. So we need to you know to make a budget for them to to make them to have [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4190.88s)]
*  their rights in all its aspects. So what what's the question here is that we have some responsibilities [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4199.12s)]
*  that we need to really judge ourselves and our behavior and we need to educate ourselves as [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4208.56s)]
*  citizens because this country needs us. We cannot take it for granted anymore. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4216.16s)]
*  We cannot. I'm gonna end the conversation here but I want to ask Ziyad and Mike if you have [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4225.04s)]
*  anything at all to add. I need to add something about the renewable energy because I missed this [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4231.84s)]
*  part. Yes yes yes because I wrote it down when the experts were talking and the [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4238.4s)]
*  Carla he gave a big picture about it but there is now an urgency to shift to a green economy [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4245.2s)]
*  and this will increase providing a new investment opportunities for future. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4252.4s)]
*  So there is a two questions I want to ask for the audience. Do we want to venture into the risky [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4256.879999999999s)]
*  fossil fuel sector? This is a question we need to ask ourselves and another question will it create [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4263.04s)]
*  actual profit and jobs the fossil? I need to give an example about the world called fleets. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4269.6s)]
*  What's happening in this sector? They are being electrified and expectations in the coming years [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4276.8s)]
*  are that the combustion engine will be gone before the mid of the century. So it's [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4285.68s)]
*  all the business around this car sectors the car fleet. It's changing. This is an example [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4292.32s)]
*  how things are shifting to a green economy. So that's what I wanted to say. What kind of world [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4300.4s)]
*  will be living in the future? This is a question we should ask ourselves about. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4308.24s)]
*  To shift and adapt to the future. Amir Ziyad very briefly if you have anything to add. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4312.4s)]
*  So yeah quick note just an ending point from my end. We did not need to have the Beirut blast [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4322.5599999999995s)]
*  to say or to decide or even to wake up and say no we need this transformation and we need those [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4329.839999999999s)]
*  structural reforms to be won. Even before that we were calling and everyone has been calling for [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4339.6s)]
*  this transformation and energy transition. So a post Beirut blast cannot be the same as before and [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4347.68s)]
*  if we are today speaking about reconstruction and rebuilding activities it is this opportunity today [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4355.120000000001s)]
*  to move from black to green and it is time to build better and to build greener. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4362.4s)]
*  And this is one ending point like at all levels. If we think at waste or water or solid waste, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4369.599999999999s)]
*  water, energy or anything else this is the main takeaway that we should be focusing on and [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4376.0s)]
*  keeping it in our minds for any planning or any future planning for the country. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4383.04s)]
*  I would add to that what my industrial engineering professor used to tell us [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4390.16s)]
*  in class is that when things are bad in the factory don't blame the workers always blame [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4397.28s)]
*  the management. So and this country lacks management and lacks leadership for the last [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4404.5599999999995s)]
*  30-40 years. You know we've only been ruled by crooks and by incompetent [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4411.44s)]
*  people and now it shows and now is the time and I see the potential of a whole new young political [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4416.96s)]
*  class coming through the ranks and then will hopefully assume responsibility for the next [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4430.0s)]
*  hundred years to build a new republic. Thank you Ziad and thank you Nada and thank you [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4437.04s)]
*  for your valuable input and yes in summary it seems after this discussion that the only way [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4444.64s)]
*  forward to build a green economy is through political change and political will and having [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4451.52s)]
*  better managers as you said Ziad and we hope that's going to be done because these are resources [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4457.76s)]
*  that we leave for our children and our children children and we hope that we can do that. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4467.12s)]
*  We need to make sure that they have something left and I am certain that we can and with what you said [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4475.12s)]
*  we can create jobs and we can even create money through a green economy. Today we're no longer [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4484.56s)]
*  talking about only protecting the environment there's a profit at so many levels including [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4491.360000000001s)]
*  an economic profit in protecting the environment and in using you know sustainable ways of moving [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4498.8s)]
*  forward. Thank you for joining us thank you for those who tuned in to listen thank you [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4506.320000000001s)]
*  Carnegie and the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung for this very valuable topic and I do hope [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4512.56s)]
*  that the environment does not sit on the backseat of our national priorities in the future. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4520.16s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHmPe3zhGc&t=4526.8s)]
