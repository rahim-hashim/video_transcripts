# Frederic Wehrey and Anouar Boukhars on ‘Salafism in the Maghreb: Politics, Piety, and Militancy’
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [December 19, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak)
*  For centuries, the countries of the Arab Maghreb, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=0.0s)]
*  Mauritania, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=3.0s)]
*  have been a rich melting pot of Islamic cultures. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=6.0s)]
*  Today, this region, which sits at the crossroads of Africa, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=9.0s)]
*  the Middle East, and Europe, is more important than ever. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=12.0s)]
*  It was the birthplace of the Arab Spring, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=15.0s)]
*  which started in Tunisia and spread across the region. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=17.0s)]
*  It's also the hub for tens of thousands of migrants [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=20.0s)]
*  who are making a perilous journey across the Mediterranean [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=23.0s)]
*  in search of a better future. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=26.0s)]
*  It's a big and energetic youthful population [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=28.0s)]
*  that's searching for better opportunities. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=30.0s)]
*  And it's a major center for a conservative Islamist movement [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=32.0s)]
*  called Salafism, which is transforming the region's politics. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=36.0s)]
*  We wanted to know who are the Salafists, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=41.0s)]
*  in what way does the movement reflect [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=43.0s)]
*  each country's distinct politics, history, and social makeup, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=45.0s)]
*  and how will this transnational, ultra-conservative Islamic current [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=49.0s)]
*  shape these dynamic, complex societies? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=54.0s)]
*  What we found, and we run counter to many stereotypes, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=58.0s)]
*  often misunderstood as a Saudi militant export, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=62.0s)]
*  Salafism is in fact molded by local contexts and opportunities. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=67.0s)]
*  So we found blurred boundaries between different Salafists. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=74.0s)]
*  Some were militant jihadists, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=78.0s)]
*  others were politically active pragmatists, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=80.0s)]
*  yet others were pro-authoritarian pacifists, known as quietists. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=83.0s)]
*  They're loyal to the states, and they don't participate in elections. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=88.0s)]
*  Yet they all had one thing in common. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=92.0s)]
*  I mean, they have upended Western assumptions [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=95.0s)]
*  about what Salafism or radical Islam looks like today. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=98.0s)]
*  Our book takes readers inside the heart of the Salafi movement. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=105.0s)]
*  You'll hear from battle-hardened jihadis and iconoclastic imams, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=108.0s)]
*  but also everyday adherents. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=112.0s)]
*  By the end, you'll have a better understanding of what makes Salafis tick. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=114.0s)]
*  You'll also learn how this important Islamic current [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=118.0s)]
*  is shaping the region's politics. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNo2vEcEak&t=121.0s)]
