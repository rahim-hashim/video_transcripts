# Trump’s Iran Escalation
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [April 29, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA)
*  Good afternoon. I'll just give everyone a minute to get seated. We can get going. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=30.0s)]
*  All right, welcome. Thank you very much for coming today to the Carnegie [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=43.2s)]
*  Endowment. I'm Karim Sajidpour, a senior fellow here. Our discussion today is about [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=46.96s)]
*  the state of US-Iran relations. This month marks the 40th anniversary of the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=51.24s)]
*  advent of the Islamic Republic in Iran, so we'll talk a little bit about the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=57.0s)]
*  past, present, and future of US-Iran relations. I wanted to also welcome our [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=59.92s)]
*  audiences who are watching on television, both a C-SPAN audience and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=65.28s)]
*  for the first time we're broadcasting this simultaneously in Iran version [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=70.0s)]
*  translation with Iran International. So welcome to audiences in Iran and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=74.6s)]
*  throughout the US. Our panel is well known to most of you here, so I'll just [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=79.2s)]
*  introduce them very briefly. Let me start off to the far right, General [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=84.72s)]
*  David Petraeus, who was formerly the commander of US forces in the Middle [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=89.1s)]
*  East, the former director of the CIA. He's now in the private sector in New York [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=93.58s)]
*  with KKR. To General Petraeus' left is Suzanne Maloney at the Brookings [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=98.17999999999999s)]
*  Institute, one of the most thoughtful scholars of Iran over the years, who was [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=103.17999999999999s)]
*  previously also at the State Department. And to my right is Ambassador Bill [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=108.3s)]
*  Burns, who was formerly Deputy Secretary of State. He's the president of the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  Carnegie Endowment and he's the author of a terrific new book called The Back [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=117.66s)]
*  Channel. And I'd like to start with a two-part question for all of you. I'll [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=120.82s)]
*  start with you, Bill. And you had several decades working on the Middle [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=125.22s)]
*  East at the State Department. You were never obviously based in Tehran, but in [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=132.66s)]
*  your book you recount two interesting memos that you wrote to both Secretary [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=136.7s)]
*  of State Condoleezza Rice and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, advocating for [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=141.57999999999998s)]
*  a different approach to Iran. So I'm curious, when you look back over the last [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=146.73999999999998s)]
*  four decades, do you think that there were examples, there were opportunities [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=151.5s)]
*  whereby we could have, the United States could have engaged Iran, taken a [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=156.66s)]
*  different approach towards Iran, that may have changed the adversarial nature of [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=161.89999999999998s)]
*  US-Iran relations as they are now? Well thanks. First let me say it's great to be [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=167.26s)]
*  here at Carnegie. I guess I'm supposed to say that as the president of Carnegie, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=171.82s)]
*  but it's especially nice to share a stage with Dave Petraeus and Suzanne and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=175.38s)]
*  Kareem, three people from whom I have enormous respect. You mentioned the two [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=179.66s)]
*  memos that I had done when I was the number three in the State Department at [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=185.01999999999998s)]
*  the end of the George W. Bush administration, the beginning of the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=189.22s)]
*  Obama administration, in which I made, you know, a quite consistent argument, I [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=192.22s)]
*  guess, demonstrating that the deep state is capable of making the same arguments [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=196.66s)]
*  to both Republican and Democratic administrations. But, you know, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=201.58s)]
*  essentially the argument was, even though the situations are not at all analogous [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=205.5s)]
*  of containment as it was applied in the Cold War toward the Soviet Union in [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=209.78s)]
*  American strategy, and dealing with Iran since the Iranian Revolution 40 years [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=215.26000000000002s)]
*  ago, that I think in many ways you can borrow from that original concept. And by [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=220.02s)]
*  that I mean both in terms of diagnosis. In other words, we're dealing with, you [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=226.06s)]
*  know, a leadership and a country with whom we have profound differences that's [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=230.78s)]
*  capable, in the case of Iran in a regional, not a global context, inflicting [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=234.58s)]
*  a fair amount of damage on us and our interests, but also a regime that has its [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=240.06s)]
*  own internal contradictions, its own historical insecurities, a huge amount of [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=245.38s)]
*  baggage and mistrust and grievance on both sides. So that's the diagnosis. The [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=249.94s)]
*  prescription, I think, is similar in the following respects, that what I thought [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=254.86s)]
*  then and continue to think today is that what you need to do in terms of American [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=258.90000000000003s)]
*  strategy is push back against external overreach by that leadership, in this [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=264.02000000000004s)]
*  case Iran and the Middle East. You need not to be shy about your concerns about [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=268.74s)]
*  human rights, but it also makes sense to selectively engage on areas where you [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=273.26s)]
*  can help manage a largely adversarial relationship. In the case of Iran, it had [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=278.3s)]
*  to do, you know, in the Obama administration, especially with the most [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=283.58000000000004s)]
*  imminent threat, which was an unconstrained nuclear program. So the short [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=287.34000000000003s)]
*  answer to your question, in my view, is that I was always skeptical that there [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=291.26s)]
*  was some grand bargain out there, some overnight transformation in the U.S.-Iranian [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=295.02000000000004s)]
*  relationship that was possible. I do think we missed some tactical [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=300.1s)]
*  opportunities to better manage the relationship. One example is right after [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=304.02s)]
*  9-11, when we dealt pretty seriously and extensively, Brian Crocker was the first [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=308.5s)]
*  of the American diplomats whom Dave and I both know well, working with the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=314.66s)]
*  Iranians who had both a stake in what came after the Taliban in Afghanistan [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=319.42s)]
*  and a fair amount of leverage as well. And that was a useful cold-blooded [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=323.82s)]
*  partnership in that era. We might have used that as the basis to begin engaging [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=328.58s)]
*  on the nuclear issue, remembering that at that point, you know, Iran was spinning [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=334.06s)]
*  dozens of centrifuges, not the thousands that they were spinning when we later [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=339.3s)]
*  engaged. So I do think we missed a moment then because after the Axis of [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=343.34s)]
*  Evil speech in early 2002, that effectively cut off that channel. So that's [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=348.17999999999995s)]
*  one example of a place where we weren't in a position, I think, to transform the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=353.17999999999995s)]
*  relationship. It was going to be largely adversarial, but I think we could have [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=357.7s)]
*  managed it in a more effective way in the cold-blooded interests of both sides. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=361.9s)]
*  So you played a critical role in the back-channel negotiations with Iran and [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=367.5s)]
*  Oman, which then led to the JCPOA, which you negotiated the first part of that. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=372.06s)]
*  And I'm curious, what was your biggest one or two takeaways from your dealings [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=376.54s)]
*  with Iran that perhaps you would share with the current Trump administration? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=381.38s)]
*  Sure. Well, I'm not sure anybody's looking for my free advice these days as [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=385.1s)]
*  a recovering diplomat. You know, I think the lesson for me anyways, that not [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=388.98s)]
* withstanding the largely adversarial relation, nature of the relationship, it [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=395.38s)]
*  was possible through selective, hard-nosed engagement to produce tangible [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=400.06s)]
*  results. And I think what I took away from, you know, long experience in [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=405.26s)]
*  dealing with senior Iranian officials was several things. First, that you had to [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=409.46s)]
*  deal with Iranian leadership as a unitary actor. We always got ourselves in [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=414.14s)]
*  trouble in previous administrations when we tried to gain the Iranian political [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=418.42s)]
*  system, searching for moderates and hardliners and others. We're not very [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=422.22s)]
*  good at that. And I think it's important to deal with the leadership as a unitary [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=426.1s)]
*  actor, recognizing that there are all sorts of factions and differences, but it [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=430.82s)]
*  doesn't make sense, I think, to try to game it. Second, leverage matters. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=434.5s)]
*  It wasn't a coincidence that when we began the secret talks, direct bilateral [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=439.82s)]
*  talks with the Iranians in early 2013, their oil exports had dropped by 50%. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=443.78s)]
*  The value of the Iranian currency had dropped by 50%. So you had set the stage, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=449.42s)]
*  I think, for a more serious negotiation. But then third, and not least, you had to [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=453.54s)]
*  connect that leverage to realistic aims. And that's where I get concerned about [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=458.38s)]
*  the current approach, which, at least on the face of it, seems to suggest that [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=463.38s)]
*  the aims are either capitulation or implosion. And I think those are aims that [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=467.94s)]
*  are not tethered to history, at least as I've understood it. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=473.14000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. General Patrice, I want to ask you the opposite question I asked [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=476.26s)]
*  Ambassador Burns, which is, were there opportunities, in your opinion, that we [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=479.74s)]
*  missed perhaps to either counter Iran, to check the regional ambitions? In [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=484.42s)]
*  particular, one of the questions which comes up was perhaps an opportunity for [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=489.97999999999996s)]
*  the United States or Israel to assassinate the Iranian Revolutionary [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=494.62s)]
*  Guard commander Qasem Soleimani. So I'm curious how you would respond to that. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=497.74s)]
*  Well, first of all, let me also say that I feel privileged to be on stage with [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=502.34s)]
*  three individuals for whom I also have great respect. Second, I want to add a [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=506.18s)]
*  tiny bit to what Bill said, because as he will recall, we actually did reach [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=513.14s)]
*  out and conduct negotiations with the Iranians in Baghdad during the course of [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=517.9s)]
*  the surge. Ambassador Crocker was the negotiator. The challenge was we had [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=523.9s)]
*  three rounds of this, and we thought there might be some opportunity to make [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=529.26s)]
*  some headway with them. But the fact was that it was very clear that there was [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=533.74s)]
*  no room at all for the negotiators. They literally would have to leave the [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=540.22s)]
*  room and make phone calls back to Tehran, literally to ask, how do we respond [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=543.5400000000001s)]
*  to this particular point or question from Ambassador Crocker? So they had [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=547.94s)]
*  no latitude. They weren't true negotiators. They were just a mouthpiece. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=552.82s)]
*  And that was disappointing. We thought there was some opportunity. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=558.1400000000001s)]
*  Beyond that, you know, look, I couldn't either confirm or deny that we ever [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=562.02s)]
*  contemplated doing something to Qasem Soleimani. I can tell you that Qasem [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=566.38s)]
*  Soleimani never set foot in Iraq during the time that I commanded the surge, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=572.26s)]
*  nor the time that I was at CENTCOM. I forget where he was during Afghanistan, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=576.78s)]
*  and he was very careful when I just happened to be the director of the CIA. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=582.82s)]
*  He really traveled only in two countries that I recall, and those were [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=587.9s)]
*  obviously Iran and then in Syria. There were some other opportunities. You [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=591.5s)]
*  know, if you... You always got to get the big ideas right, and I think the biggest [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=597.9399999999999s)]
*  of the big ideas with Iran was that you have to be firm. They will probe you, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=601.5799999999999s)]
*  they will test you. If you don't respond, they'll push a little bit further. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=605.98s)]
*  And there may have been some opportunities. The challenge was always the [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=610.74s)]
*  politics within Iraq. So for example, when the Erbil 5 were detained by our [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=615.98s)]
*  Special Operations Forces in January of 2007, these were five Quds Force operatives [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=621.74s)]
*  who were up to no good in a very significant way. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=627.3000000000001s)]
*  And I was not yet the commander. I was still going through the confirmation [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=632.0600000000001s)]
*  process at that time. I remember it though, and I remember the pressure was [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=636.7800000000001s)]
*  enormous from, I believe, from both the president and the prime minister of [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=641.42s)]
*  Iraq at that time that we had to release them. And I talked to General Casey [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=646.06s)]
*  and my predecessor about that later on, and it seemed as if we just had [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=650.14s)]
*  no real choice. Again, it was a moment of real inflection. Here we are, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=654.38s)]
*  we need the prime minister's support for the surge. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=658.3399999999999s)]
*  The biggest of the big ideas of which were all contrary to what he had [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=663.3399999999999s)]
*  just agreed to accelerate with President Bush in a meeting in Amman, Jordan [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=666.6999999999999s)]
*  in late November of 2006. So again, I think the politics were just very, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=672.3s)]
*  very difficult. The same is true when it came to releasing Ali Musa [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=677.38s)]
*  Daqduk. Remember, he was a very high ranking Lebanese Hezbollah official [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=681.9399999999999s)]
*  who was detained together with [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=687.5s)]
*  Qais Qazali and Laith Qazali who were part of the Asab al-Haq later on. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=690.14s)]
*  They were militia leaders who had carried cold blooded murder of five [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=694.9s)]
*  of our soldiers. We found the very detailed evidence, not just intelligence [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=698.66s)]
*  on that. That's what prevented, frankly, the prime minister from demanding [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=703.78s)]
*  that we release them after they were detained. I was very disappointed [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=707.4599999999999s)]
*  to see some five years after they were detained that they were tried [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=711.62s)]
*  by an Iraqi court and basically found not guilty of anything despite [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=716.5s)]
*  the extraordinary evidence that we had connecting them with those murders. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=720.66s)]
*  Frankly, the same with Qais Qazali who is now a militia leader and despite [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=725.9399999999999s)]
*  a constitution that prevents militia leaders from being in the... [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=730.8199999999999s)]
*  Or the law that prevents them from being in the council representatives [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=734.9s)]
*  is a member of the COR. So welcome back to the land of the two [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=737.9399999999999s)]
*  rivers. It's an interesting place as always. So I think there were some [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=742.74s)]
*  of those. Those are still pretty tactical opportunities. In the same way [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=748.22s)]
*  Bill, I think, talks about the others. There was the outreach from, of course, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=752.0600000000001s)]
*  Qasem Soleimani to me through President Talabani in March of 2008 when we [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=757.34s)]
*  were fighting against the Shia militia, a very significant battle in Basra. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=764.7s)]
*  And he wanted to be sure that I knew that he, Qasem Soleimani, also [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=770.7s)]
*  Haji Qasem, controlled the policy for Iran when it came to Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=776.94s)]
*  Gaza, and Afghanistan and now presumably probably put Yemen in there as well. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=785.9000000000001s)]
*  Let's never forget that it is the Quds Force that controls the policy, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=790.86s)]
*  not the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or some other state organization. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=795.9000000000001s)]
*  Again, there was no real opportunity for constructive dialogue at that point [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=800.1400000000001s)]
*  in time. There's, as I said, audiences watching in Iran and as the former [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=804.3s)]
*  director of the CIA, I think they'd be very curious to know, I'm curious, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=810.8599999999999s)]
*  frankly, to know how you would rate American intelligence on Iran, both in [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=815.18s)]
*  terms of our assessment, our understanding of Iranian societal political trends and [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=819.9s)]
*  our technical capacities. First, let me actually say hello to the [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=825.5s)]
*  Iranian people. Believe it or not, we used to have a lot of interaction with them [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=830.78s)]
*  because I would go to the border crossings between Iraq and Iran. There were a lot of [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=834.62s)]
*  reasons to inspect those, frankly, and we had quite careful procedures for that and [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=839.42s)]
*  I wanted to make sure that they were being followed. But inevitably, we would encounter [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=844.4599999999999s)]
*  a flood of Iranian religious tourists who were going to Najaf, Karbala, the other holy [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=849.66s)]
*  sites of Shia Islam. Of course, Najaf is the holiest and coincidentally, it was the [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=856.46s)]
*  division I was privileged to command, the 101st Airborne Division, that liberated those [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=862.46s)]
*  sites during the fight to Baghdad when I was a two-star general. So I felt a certain [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=866.7800000000001s)]
*  continuing connection to Najaf and to Karbala and it's pretty well known that we worked [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=870.86s)]
*  very hard to make sure that there wasn't even a nick in the famous Gold Dome Mosque [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=875.98s)]
*  in Najaf, even though we were being shot at quite significantly from areas near that. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=881.4200000000001s)]
*  So we used to engage with them and it was fascinating. They actually were very positive. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=887.4200000000001s)]
*  In fact, old Iranian women would come up and they would always want to grab you by the cheek and, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=892.38s)]
*  you know, General Petraeus, you know, so good to see you. And my security, needless to say, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=898.94s)]
*  thought they were going for the jugular on most occasions. It was not the case. When it came to [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=904.3000000000001s)]
*  our intelligence, I have always felt that it was really quite solid. There are some very specific [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=910.9399999999999s)]
*  examples of this, that the so-called secret site, say at Fordow, near Gold, I mean, we knew about [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=918.54s)]
*  that for, I think it was years and it was, they declared it when they discovered somehow that we [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=925.58s)]
*  were about to out them on this. We were going to announce it to the world that there was this [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=931.8199999999999s)]
*  secret site that they had not declared. And generally, again, it comes and goes as methods [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=935.9s)]
*  and sources and all the rest of that are good or, you know, not turn out to be not so good over time, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=942.54s)]
*  inevitably, but together with other countries who also have really quite good intelligence [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=950.06s)]
*  inside Iran. I felt that we had quite a solid understanding. There's a tiny degree of [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=956.46s)]
*  sense of black box about the supreme leader and the inner circle, needless to say. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=966.3000000000001s)]
*  But I think that's not unlike other countries where, again, trying to truly read the mind of a leader [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=974.38s)]
*  has always been more than an imperfect science. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=981.82s)]
*  Suzanne, I want to ask you to bring us to the present state of play. Obviously, you can [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=985.74s)]
*  feel free to reflect on some of General Petraeus and Ambassador Burns' comments about the context, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=990.0600000000001s)]
*  but in particular, I'm curious for your assessment of the Trump administration's current [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=995.58s)]
*  approach towards Iran. I wrote a piece this morning in which I argue I think there's perhaps [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1001.34s)]
*  never been a greater discrepancy between a president and his national security advisor, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1006.06s)]
*  and that President Trump has made it pretty clear that he has no interest in conflict in the [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1011.66s)]
*  Middle East. He's not a democracy guy. He has an affinity for autocrats, whereas John Bolton has [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1017.3399999999999s)]
*  a long history of advocating for conflict regime change with Iran. So your assessment of the Trump [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1023.02s)]
*  administration's approach and then how you think Iran is most likely to respond in the coming weeks [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1028.46s)]
*  and months. Great. Well, thank you so much, and I'm really honored to be part of this discussion [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1035.58s)]
*  with such a distinguished group of speakers. I think it's important to talk about the Trump [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1041.1s)]
*  administration's policy with this backdrop of the history of U.S.-Iran relations and with the [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1047.6599999999999s)]
*  awareness that while there have been moments in time in almost every administration since 1979, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1053.58s)]
*  that the U.S. and Iran might have come into a different opportunity for some kind of more [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1061.18s)]
*  productive dialogue. I think it's overly romanticized often that if only we had accepted [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1066.0600000000002s)]
*  or permitted the oil deal that was offered to Conoco, the first upstream deal in Iran [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1071.98s)]
*  since the revolution in 1995, or if only we had made good on talks that began or avoided language [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1077.66s)]
*  like axis of evil, somehow things would have been different. We have been confronting with Iran [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1086.3s)]
*  a regime which is very much formulated around a presumption of anti-Americanism, a regime that [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1093.74s)]
*  for most of its post-revolutionary history has been unwilling to engage directly in public, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1100.46s)]
*  authoritative fashion with the United States, with only a couple of exceptions, which of course have [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1105.98s)]
*  already been referenced here in the post-911 opportunities, some of the dialogues that took [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1112.38s)]
*  place when General Petraeus was in Baghdad, and most recently of course the negotiations that led [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1116.7s)]
*  up to the JCPOA. We have become accustomed I think to seeing Javad Zarif on our television screens, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1124.14s)]
*  the Iranian foreign minister speaking directly to the American people and to the American president, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1129.74s)]
*  but of course that is a relatively new feature of the bilateral dynamic and it's important to [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1134.5400000000002s)]
*  remember that for most of the past 40 years we've been laboring with the difficulty of an [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1139.66s)]
*  adversary that has often sought to avoid any direct dialogue with us. I think that's no longer the [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1145.1000000000001s)]
*  case today and that is one of the few advantages to the situation that we find ourselves in in the [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1151.5800000000002s)]
*  aftermath of the Trump administration's decision to walk away from the Iran nuclear deal. As Kareem [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1157.5s)]
*  points out very eloquently in the piece that he's published today in the Atlantic, there is this [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1164.62s)]
*  divergence that's very obvious between the president and his national security cabinet and it's been a [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1170.6999999999998s)]
*  consistent one almost since the the campaign period. Remember President Trump campaigned on [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1177.58s)]
*  renegotiating the Iran deal. He distinguished himself even back then in 2015-2016 from the other [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1183.02s)]
*  Republicans in the race who were all promising to rip up the deal on day one. The president sees [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1189.82s)]
*  himself as a negotiator, this is his background as a wheeler dealer in the real estate business [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1194.86s)]
*  and he is quite convinced I think genuinely that he could somehow produce a better bargain with [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1201.1799999999998s)]
*  the Iranians than was negotiated after more than a decade of talks through two administrations from [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1206.46s)]
*  both parties here in in Washington and with the cooperation of the other permanent five members [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1213.82s)]
*  of the UN Security Council plus Germany. President Trump thinks he can do better than that, let him [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1219.74s)]
*  have his opportunity. Of course what he has staffed himself with is a national security cabinet and I [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1225.02s)]
*  limit this simply to the national security advisor John Bolton but a cabinet that really [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1233.34s)]
*  is invested in this notion that pressure on Iran will work if sufficiently applied [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1239.58s)]
*  and I think we're living in a real-time experiment. You know we all remember at least those of us in [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1245.42s)]
*  Washington and certainly those of you in Iran will remember the intense debates that took place [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1250.54s)]
*  around the negotiations that began with Iran at least in public fashion in 2013 [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1255.5s)]
*  and then around the nuclear deal once it was concluded in 2015. Was it enough? Should we have [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1262.22s)]
*  gone for broke? We for the first time in post-revolutionary history had assembled [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1267.9s)]
*  a multilateral coalition that was in fact applying real economic pressure to Iran. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1271.9s)]
*  This had never happened before in any serious fashion not even when American diplomats were [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1278.3000000000002s)]
*  held hostage in Iran. For the first time this economic pressure was working it was appearing [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1283.26s)]
*  to produce some new readiness on the part of as I said a regime that had been unwilling to engage [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1289.3400000000001s)]
*  in a serious way on this issue or many others for many years. Why didn't we simply push it to the [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1295.02s)]
*  natural limit and try to get everything try to get a much bigger better deal? I think what you're [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1300.62s)]
*  seeing right now in terms of the kind of strategic impasse that this administration is facing with [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1305.98s)]
*  respect to Iran is that's fine rhetoric and that pressure for the sake of pressure may keep Iran [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1311.66s)]
*  in a box for a period but it doesn't actually produce a resolution of the situation and so long [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1317.26s)]
*  as you have Iran facing a virtual economic war with its back against the wall with no serious [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1323.26s)]
*  opportunity for engaging with this administration although obviously Foreign Minister Zarif's recent [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1330.22s)]
*  appearance on Fox News and his trip to New York last week I think was evidence that they're open [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1336.14s)]
*  to trying. As long as this regime is backed into a corner we are all very much at the mercy of the [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1341.02s)]
*  decision making in Tehran and that is quite a worrisome thing because there's really only one [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1347.74s)]
*  alternative that the regime has to its at its disposal at this point in time that can work to [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1353.9s)]
*  its advantage. People worry about will Iran break out of the nuclear deal will they retaliate against [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1358.78s)]
*  U.S. forces in the region. These are all reasonable concerns legitimate concerns but the real advantage [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1365.3400000000001s)]
*  to Iran doesn't come from either of those moves the real advantage comes to Iran if in fact they [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1371.8200000000002s)]
*  take some step to disrupt energy supplies coming out of one of their neighbors. It's a long-standing [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1376.86s)]
*  strategic precept for the Iranians that if we can't export our neighbors won't be able to export [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1382.6999999999998s)]
*  either and the one thing that any disruption to energy supplies would do for Iran is raise the [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1387.34s)]
*  price of oil improve their own bottom line in terms of whatever revenues they're able to repatriate [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1393.1799999999998s)]
*  and hurt the president's political capital here at home in terms of being able to continue to [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1399.02s)]
*  apply sanctions and that's a real risk that we face. Well I think that is a real risk. I think [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1403.26s)]
*  though that the prospect of President Trump responding with military action against Iran [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1411.98s)]
*  in Iran proper rather than elsewhere which has generally been the approach that we have taken [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1419.9s)]
*  not always obviously there's certainly reports of alleged covert action in various locations [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1425.34s)]
*  but I think that the situation is different. I think President Trump presents sort of an unknown [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1433.02s)]
*  risk to them. He has taken action in Syria when red lines were crossed it was proportionate measured [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1440.22s)]
*  and so forth but I think that's a concern but there's no doubt that this is going to hurt a [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1447.18s)]
*  country that already is in a very significant recession already has very significant inflation [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1454.62s)]
*  really substantial inflation and already is watching the real its currency decline very [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1461.58s)]
*  precipitously and so it is going to be in a very tough spot and the question I think is just whether [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1468.1399999999999s)]
*  or not they're going to grit their teeth and try to bear this and tough it out noting that there are [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1474.3s)]
*  there have been lots of signs of unrest not coordinated but just somewhat spontaneous [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1481.1s)]
*  demonstrations throughout the country unlike in the past where there generally was some organizing [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1487.5s)]
*  feature or function or you know in the wake of the election for example in Tehran. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1494.54s)]
*  In this case and there's also environmental degradation that's now starting to cause real [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1501.58s)]
*  movement of people inside with again mismanagement of water on and on the challenges I think are very [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1506.94s)]
*  very substantial and again do they just tough it out till November 2020 hope for someone other than [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1514.14s)]
*  President Trump to be elected or do they actually come to the table sometime next year and say hey [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1520.46s)]
*  well let's let's talk about this. Then you wrote a book about Iran's political economy you worked [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1526.8600000000001s)]
*  at Exxon what's your sense of whether they can sustain they could conceivably go below or at [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1532.6200000000001s)]
*  500,000 barrels per day exported is that something that Iran can sustain until November 2020? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1539.8999999999999s)]
*  I think it's an unanswerable question in the sense that Iran can muddle through an enormous amount of [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1547.82s)]
*  economic duress we've seen this over the past 40 years on repeated occasions most notably during [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1553.82s)]
*  the 1980s when the war with Iraq was raging and the Saudis for reasons that had more to do with [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1560.7s)]
*  market share than to do with Iran decided to try to break OPEC and expanded production to the point [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1567.18s)]
*  that drove Iranian oil revenues down to less than 10 million less than 10 billion dollars a year. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1575.5800000000002s)]
*  This was an enormously painful episode for Iran and yet it did not produce a change in Iran's [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1583.8200000000002s)]
*  approach to the war with Iraq at least not in the near term and it did not at that time provoke the [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1589.74s)]
*  internal debate within the system about what are the choices that we face today because that [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1596.7s)]
*  simply wasn't permissible. I think that we are in a different position today in Iran we've seen these [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1602.14s)]
*  kinds of debate about the choices available to the regime and the alternatives that the system [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1608.38s)]
*  faces if in fact it cannot sustain the degree of economic productivity and at least some sense [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1615.1000000000001s)]
*  that there are going to be that there's a light at the end of the tunnel. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1623.34s)]
*  There is a debate both within the regime but there's also a debate on the streets as General [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1627.34s)]
*  Petraeus suggested Iran has been experiencing a considerable degree of very small scale but [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1630.9399999999998s)]
*  persistent unrest almost entirely driven by economic considerations and so to the extent that [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1636.78s)]
*  the sole priority for the leadership of the Islamic Republic is the preservation of the system [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1643.98s)]
*  they have to recognize that any amount of economic duress particularly one that doesn't have a [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1650.22s)]
*  natural end state there is an award that can be ended there isn't a drought that can simply be [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1656.3s)]
*  resolved by a change in weather patterns that this is in fact a long-term economic siege that [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1660.94s)]
*  the system has to muddle through. My sense is that the leadership will not try to simply wait it out [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1667.42s)]
*  until 2021. They are trying to demonstrate that they have some staying power that they're not [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1674.62s)]
*  going to collapse immediately and I think it was important you know you didn't see Zarif here in [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1679.82s)]
*  September saying that they were open to a prisoner negotiations they waited until it was clear [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1684.78s)]
*  that maximum pressure had been applied but if you think back to the 20 to the 2013 negotiations [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1690.78s)]
*  even the the back channel conversations that wasn't it was a period of months between the [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1697.34s)]
*  application of the full weight of American financial sanctions targeting Iran's energy exports [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1702.94s)]
*  and the beginning of some of those more productive conversations with the Iranians and I think it [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1709.8200000000002s)]
*  was a recognition at the time that they simply while they might be able to muddle through they [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1713.66s)]
*  simply didn't want to because it endangered the long-term vitality of the system. Today those [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1718.7s)]
*  pressures are even more acute with 80 million Iranians and 160 million sim cards a cell phone [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1724.6200000000001s)]
*  in every hand the fact that information disperses very quickly the fact that there is already a [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1731.34s)]
*  jockeying for succession around the future of the supreme leader who has recently turned 80. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1737.5s)]
*  This is a system that recognizes that it doesn't have time to spare and so I think they're looking [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1743.98s)]
*  for a way out of the impasse that they're facing. Unfortunately the administration despite the fact [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1749.6599999999999s)]
*  that the president himself may be interested in a negotiation hasn't created any kind of a credible [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1755.82s)]
*  platform or framework for negotiations. It's possible they're doing this behind the scenes [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1762.3s)]
*  via Oman there were many who worried about what the Obama administration was doing back in 2012 [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1767.8999999999999s)]
*  before it became clear that some of these conversations were already underway but it [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1773.8999999999999s)]
*  we don't see any evidence of it either from Iran's behavior or from this administration and I think [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1778.7s)]
*  again that lack of a direct channel to try to find a way out of this impasse is going to be [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1784.06s)]
*  something that turns the Iranians away from potentially some kind of diplomatic dialogue [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1790.3s)]
*  and in the direction of trying to provoke a crisis. General did you want to weigh in? Well I think it's [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1795.98s)]
*  entirely possible this time that they're driven down to below 500,000 barrels maybe even lower. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1801.1s)]
*  I mean there are going to be some that are produced by Sinopec and another Chinese company they're [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1806.7s)]
*  actually doing the production presumably export maybe that slides through but I think again the [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1812.54s)]
*  situation is different. This administration is different the waivers that were allowed [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1818.62s)]
*  obviously are going away there were still some there and you know both Bill and I were in [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1824.1399999999999s)]
*  position back the last time this was done and this was very carefully calibrated and then as [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1828.54s)]
*  we were reminiscing I was the one who went to the Saudis and asked Al-Jabbar the ambassador [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1834.7s)]
*  to convey the need to produce an additional 1 million barrels and to either tell the market [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1841.02s)]
*  or go out and individually tell countries so that the market wouldn't spook and by the way it did not. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1846.3s)]
*  I think the Saudis will pick up the slack again this time along with the Emiratis perhaps the [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1852.06s)]
*  Iraqis and then our shale producers but I think you're going to see this it's entirely likely [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1857.02s)]
*  that it could go well below 500,000 barrels. The Chinese at a time of these very sensitive trade [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1863.98s)]
*  negotiations don't want to pick a fight with the U.S. over a few hundred thousand barrels of oil [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1869.9s)]
*  that probably can be replaced again by the Saudis, the Emiratis or others. India I don't think again [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1874.8600000000001s)]
*  wants to to get crosswise either so I think this is a very different situation for the Iranians and [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1881.82s)]
*  the other factor I didn't mention of course is as a result of all of the developments that I mentioned [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1889.18s)]
*  there's increased unemployment in the country that already was suffering from a lot of unemployment [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1895.18s)]
*  so this is a very very difficult situation that they face. I'm sure we'll get back to some of [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1899.98s)]
*  those in the Q&A but I want to move to the JCPOA Iran deal which was one of the most hotly debated [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1905.18s)]
*  geopolitical decisions over the last decade in the U.S. I noticed that. I noticed that and is coming to [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1911.66s)]
*  the fore again and certainly the democratic primary debate it seems to be one of the chief [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1918.22s)]
*  foreign policy questions the decision whether or not the United States should should go back to the [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1924.3s)]
*  JCPOA in the event that the JCPOA sustains itself over the next couple years so my question to you [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1929.82s)]
*  is how would you how do you see the future of the JCPOA imagine it is able to survive which is not a [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1937.18s)]
*  foregone conclusion over the next two years and a democratic administration comes to office what [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1946.78s)]
*  would you be what would be your advice in terms of how to think about the future of the JCPOA? [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1952.54s)]
*  Sure well let me before I get to that question let me just make two points on on what Dave and [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1958.22s)]
*  Suzanne have been saying first I do think the situation is in some ways different today I do [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1963.98s)]
*  not underestimate the capacity of the United States through the unilateral re-imposition of sanctions [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1969.82s)]
*  to do an awful lot of economic damage to Iran and you're right the energy market is different too [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1975.82s)]
*  however I come back to a point I made at the start and that is that that kind of leverage and [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1981.5s)]
*  pressure only works if it's connected to a realistic set of aims and my concern right now [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1986.06s)]
*  is what's on offer for the Iranians the 12 points that Secretary Pompeo laid out is in effect aimed [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=1992.54s)]
*  not at producing a better deal but at producing either the capitulation of this Iranian regime [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2000.62s)]
*  or its implosion neither of which I think is is tethered to history as I suggested before [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2006.4599999999998s)]
*  so that's one point the second is just simply to state that you know I believe that the president's [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2012.62s)]
*  decision to pull out of the JCPOA was an historic mistake and I think that for the following reasons [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2017.9799999999998s)]
*  first you know it's done a lot of collateral damage not just to our credibility in terms of [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2024.86s)]
*  negotiating with other countries against a pattern of retreat not just from the Iran nuclear agreement [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2030.2199999999998s)]
*  but from the Paris climate agreement from the trans-pacific partnership the big trade agreement [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2036.4599999999998s)]
*  in Asia that's first second I think it does actually widen the fissures between us and our [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2041.4199999999998s)]
*  closest European allies who are trying to hold the agreement together in effect doing Vladimir [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2047.58s)]
*  Putin's work for him third I think it is eroding over time the efficacy of sanctions because [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2053.9s)]
*  sanctions worked in the run-up to the talks that began in 2013 because they were widely shared [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2060.78s)]
*  however grudgingly on the part of Russia and China and some others it was it was an international [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2067.34s)]
*  effort that brought real pressure to bear and I think by unilaterally reimposing sanctions you [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2073.1s)]
*  have even the foreign minister of Germany one of our closest allies standing up a year ago and [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2079.1s)]
*  saying all of us need to reduce our vulnerability to the US financial system so that's a cost that's [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2083.74s)]
*  not going to be seen overnight or next year but we'll wake up five or six years from now and find [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2089.58s)]
*  that that tool which was not always used wisely in the past is less effective so to answer your [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2095.2599999999998s)]
*  question if you assume that the agreement holds together which is a big assumption because I do [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2100.8599999999997s)]
*  think there's a real danger of inadvertent collisions I take general Petraeus's point that [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2107.1s)]
*  the Iranian regime may be very careful in dealing with this president but you know as we both know [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2112.78s)]
*  the Middle East is the land of where stuff happens things happen you can escalate very quickly we've [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2118.38s)]
*  been all very fortunate in the last two and a half years in this administration that the United States [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2124.1400000000003s)]
*  has not faced a prolonged international crisis I never served an administration where you went [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2128.6200000000003s)]
*  that long without a prolonged international crisis but I worry about the incoherence that [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2134.1400000000003s)]
*  Kareem mentioned you know between the president and some of the senior advisors and our capacity [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2139.66s)]
*  to manage that kind of an escalation so but if you assume that the agreement is still living [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2144.7799999999997s)]
*  and breathing you know in January 2001 and you have a different administration I think you would [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2150.3799999999997s)]
*  make sense to do two things first to resume you know our compliance with the JCPOA to rejoin it [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2156.46s)]
*  but simultaneously you would have to start you know a serious negotiation a kind of follow-on [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2164.94s)]
*  negotiation which you know I've always experienced in any arms control process that I've been involved [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2171.02s)]
*  in which would deal with some of the obvious challenges in the JCPOA some of the provisions [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2176.86s)]
*  in that agreement the so-called sunset clauses would be much closer to their expiry we'd have [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2182.78s)]
*  to begin a conversation about a range of other issues that are not dealt with in that comprehensive [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2188.3s)]
*  nuclear agreement on ballistic missile development to begin a conversation about challenges where we [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2193.26s)]
*  bump into each other across the middle east so I think so long as we were able to couple [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2198.94s)]
*  a resumption of US participation in that agreement with a serious negotiation simultaneously [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2204.1400000000003s)]
*  about follow-on understandings I think that's what would make sense thank you I want to move [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2211.1000000000004s)]
*  in a second to audience questions so please think about what you'd like to ask but I'd be remiss for [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2216.2200000000003s)]
*  if I neglect following question which I'll oppose to all of you two part and you can feel free to [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2222.38s)]
*  to take each question or ignore them but is the decision to trump administration's decision to [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2229.1s)]
*  designate the revolutionary guards a terrorist organization this is a decision that I know the [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2235.42s)]
*  bush administration was contemplating um the administration was contemplating um but it was [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2240.06s)]
*  uh you know revolutionary guards have over the last decade become Iran's most important economic [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2247.74s)]
*  political institution what are the ramifications of that designation do you agree with it and then [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2253.9799999999996s)]
*  second what we've seen over the last decade and a half in the middle east is kind of Iran trying to [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2259.5s)]
*  McDonaldize the Hezbollah model you know to franchise Hezbollah from Lebanon to Iraq to Syria [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2267.3399999999997s)]
*  to Yemen and at a time when most Americans don't want a greater presence in the middle east [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2273.66s)]
*  how do we contend with you on so perhaps general portrays we can start with you and then we'll come [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2279.3399999999997s)]
*  well sure first of all I am not sure that the this latest designation is as significant as it sounds [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2283.2599999999998s)]
*  because they had already IRGC had already been designated by the treasury department which is [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2291.8199999999997s)]
*  the one that frankly most counts and there are already some uh if you call them exceptions or [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2296.54s)]
*  explanations of what the latest designation actually means given how entwined the IRGC is as [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2304.54s)]
*  you mentioned in the economy the diplomacy and all the other activities so I'm not so sure that this [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2313.9s)]
*  is a this is very important in rhetorical policy and that does matter that is not insignificant [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2319.26s)]
*  for the state department and so forth but again the big designation is the one that generally [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2327.34s)]
*  follows the treasury and that had already identified the IRGC not just the Quds Force [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2334.1400000000003s)]
*  again as a essentially a terrorist entity the second look I think it's very important to [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2340.46s)]
*  understand that Iran has for some time wanted to Lebanonize Iraq and Syria as you described it and [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2347.58s)]
*  in other words they want to do in those countries what they have done successfully in Lebanon which [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2357.34s)]
*  is to create a very powerful paramilitary force which gives them enormous muscle on the street [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2363.74s)]
*  particularly in shia areas of a country and then to follow that by getting that same force [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2370.7s)]
*  enormous power in the parliament in the legislature of a country to the point that in Lebanon its [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2378.22s)]
*  coalition around Hezbollah actually has a blocking veto if they choose to use that [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2385.02s)]
*  more difficult to do this in in Syria certainly where there's always been some differences to [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2392.2999999999997s)]
*  begin with and it's not quite the same kind of structure and so forth but Iraq I think this is a [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2397.58s)]
*  significant challenge the council of representatives does have some members as I mentioned earlier [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2405.58s)]
*  who actually are leaders of the militia the Hashd al-Shabi the popular mobilization forces [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2411.34s)]
*  one of the big challenges that this very impressive leadership team of the president the [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2418.06s)]
*  prime minister and speaker of the council of representatives in Iraq have is how to deal with [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2423.5s)]
*  the fact that not all of the entities that have the force if you will as you all know you know [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2429.5s)]
*  government has to have a monopoly on the legitimate use of force this is a problem if you have an [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2437.18s)]
*  element such as those in the Hashd al-Shabi noting by the way and we should all acknowledge that they [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2443.18s)]
*  did serve Iraq at a time when the Islamic state was literally knocking on the doors [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2449.58s)]
*  or on the walls of Baghdad and did come to the service of their country and tragically [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2455.1s)]
*  the situation was allowed to reach that point where the grand ayatollah in Najaf actually had [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2461.1s)]
*  to essentially say now is the time to come to the aid of your country which legitimized the return [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2467.8199999999997s)]
*  of these militia to the street militia that you will recall have been destroyed [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2474.46s)]
*  back during the battles of march and april 2008 in bosra throughout the southern provinces in [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2481.42s)]
*  sadr city and kademi and a variety of other places so with that understanding again what do we have [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2487.42s)]
*  to do it comes back to what bill was talking about with actions to undermine the effectiveness of [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2496.06s)]
*  elements that would like to again take control of iraq in iraq a country that has to have a [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2503.58s)]
*  relationship with iran again it's always going to be its bigger neighbor to the east we have [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2510.94s)]
*  to understand that we have to try not to be an obstacle to that but it should be a mutually [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2515.18s)]
*  productive mutually beneficial relationship not one in which iran can lean on iraq and get what [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2520.94s)]
*  they want done through various levers of power that they control now what else do we need to do [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2527.74s)]
*  well we should certainly make sure that whatever our plans for syria are that we do not allow the [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2534.62s)]
*  establishment of a ground line of communication and i'm talking now about a hardball road you [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2542.06s)]
*  can go through the desert and various places for iraq and into syria but we're talking about big [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2546.54s)]
*  trucks that would carry major items of equipment and we should ensure together with our iraqi [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2553.74s)]
*  partners that iraq does not become a line a ground line of communication from iran through iraq [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2560.06s)]
*  through syria and down into southern lebanon and hezbollah or to iranian military industries [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2567.66s)]
*  in syria which clearly israel our ally has shown that they will not allow so to avoid that turning [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2574.14s)]
*  into a bigger crisis again i think we can make a major contribution by staying as we have at the [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2581.42s)]
*  border crossing at al-tomf which is one of the two hardball crossings the other one obviously being [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2587.1800000000003s)]
*  up at al-qaim and husayba and and is reasonably well covered i think by iraqi security forces [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2593.1000000000004s)]
*  together with some of our coalition forces so that's a very very significant goal it was [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2600.2200000000003s)]
*  something that could have been called into question by a complete withdrawal from syria [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2607.1s)]
*  but reportedly is very much in the forefront of the mind in the white house state and defense [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2612.22s)]
*  then i'd also like to ask both you and bill there there are some concerns you know arab gulf officials [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2620.38s)]
*  claim that they've picked up intelligence that iran is planning to go after them in the region [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2627.8199999999997s)]
*  as a reaction to u.s escalation obviously go after them via proxy so in addition to the [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2634.94s)]
*  earlier questions i posed it you can talk about maybe some of your concerns of possible escalation [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2641.26s)]
*  in the coming months well in terms of the designation itself i tend to agree with general [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2647.26s)]
*  petraeus i think it doesn't really change the game in terms of pressure on iran i think some [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2653.1s)]
*  of the reaction here in washington and elsewhere may have contributed to this over hyping of the [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2660.06s)]
*  of the issue itself both from the administration but also from its critics those who immediately [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2667.02s)]
*  leapt to the presumption that this was a slippery slope to war i think are reading far too much into [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2673.5s)]
*  the reality of this mechanism and there is a temptation a tendency that i've seen at least [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2680.06s)]
*  for the past dozen years for every group in washington and it again it's deep state it's [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2686.38s)]
*  applied both to republican and democratic administrations to see every evidence of pressure [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2694.94s)]
*  on iran as a step toward war i don't think that has been the case it hasn't proven to be the case [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2700.3s)]
*  to date and i think the fact that you have a commander in chief that for whatever his other [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2705.58s)]
*  flaws seems to be deeply averse to any kind of military u.s military intervention in the [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2710.38s)]
*  middle east is at least something of a check on a deliberate move toward a military crisis [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2716.1400000000003s)]
*  in the region as i said i have great concerns about the risks of inadvertent escalation but i [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2722.94s)]
*  don't think this administration is trying to jump into a war and i'm i don't quite buy into the the [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2729.42s)]
*  hype that the president's advisors are trying to trick him into a war because that's what they're [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2736.86s)]
*  after so i think we have to be careful to analyze the specific steps and their particular implications [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2741.98s)]
*  rather than to read too much into them in terms of the broader regional influence question and [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2749.26s)]
*  how iran may retaliate against some of its adversaries across the region i think we're [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2755.42s)]
*  left with this you know perennial dilemma what we've found is that engagement with iran hasn't in [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2760.3s)]
*  fact ameliorated iran's capacity to extend its influence often in ways that are destabilizing [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2766.94s)]
*  often in ways that are inimical to u.s interests and to the broader interests in a peaceful [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2775.5800000000004s)]
*  prosperous middle east but we've found that pressure hasn't yet produced a significant change [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2780.54s)]
*  for the better either whether it was under the bush administration whether it's under the current [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2788.62s)]
*  administration there is some evidence that the sanctions are having an impact on iran's capacity [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2792.7799999999997s)]
*  to provide financial support to hesbollah possibly also on the oil subsidy that has been a long [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2798.7s)]
*  standing feature of the relationship with syria but ultimately it's not really undermining iran's [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2804.7s)]
*  posture across the region and what we've seen you know if you thought back 20 years ago when i first [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2810.46s)]
*  started working on iran the idea that iran could in fact be the ascendant power across the levante [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2815.82s)]
*  would have been inconceivable and so i think we have to begin to look at the other factors [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2821.1800000000003s)]
*  obviously they're there and obviously there are lots of folks who spend a lot of time thinking [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2826.54s)]
*  about this but we often have these conversations almost in disjointed ways about iran that is [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2830.1400000000003s)]
*  inevitably hegemonic and one that is seemingly all-powerful but we ignore the rest of the [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2837.26s)]
*  the factors that our friends like michelle dunn spend a lot of time on in terms of [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2845.58s)]
*  leadership and governance across the broader middle east and i think if we want to really [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2850.22s)]
*  address the crisis that iran has contributed to is benefiting from it really is incumbent upon us [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2854.86s)]
*  to think about how we address the vacuum of good governance and and enlightened leadership in the [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2862.22s)]
*  arab world because that's exactly those those vacuums that iran moves into takes advantage of [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2868.62s)]
*  sets up these parallel institutions that then in effect hijack and strangle the institutions [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2874.06s)]
*  of the state itself very good points bill yeah and i guess that returns me to the original point [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2880.2999999999997s)]
*  i've made about containment as a sort of framework for thinking about american strategy toward iran [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2885.42s)]
*  however imperfect the analogy to the soviet union in the old cold war because what um suzanne said [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2891.02s)]
*  is exactly right i mean part of what animated containment in george kennan's view was the [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2898.06s)]
*  importance of shoring up you know neighboring countries reducing their vulnerabilities and [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2903.66s)]
*  you know i think right now in an era in which you can see the deeper drivers of change throughout [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2909.8199999999997s)]
*  much of the sunni arab world in particular accelerating and the dysfunctions getting worse [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2915.2599999999998s)]
*  you know we're doing too much indulging i think of authoritarian regimes who aren't paying attention [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2921.18s)]
*  to those internal problems which create opportunities for what is essentially a [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2926.54s)]
*  counterpunching regime like iran which is not 10 feet tall but takes advantage of the vulnerabilities [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2931.42s)]
*  and dysfunctions of others so that's an extremely important part i think of a sensible american [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2937.7400000000002s)]
*  strategy which you don't see much in evidence today beyond that i think it's the point also [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2943.1800000000003s)]
*  i've made that of course pressure matters you have to push back against external overreach but that [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2948.94s)]
*  has to be combined with a willingness to selectively engage and not see diplomacy as a favor or a [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2953.9s)]
*  reward for bad behavior but rather as a smart investment because by engaging you're better able [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2960.94s)]
*  to mobilize lots of other countries who when we can demonstrate we're not the problem that's iranian [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2967.58s)]
*  behavior that's the problem that's what animated you know a large part of what president obama tried [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2974.14s)]
*  to do in the run-up to the nuclear negotiation good point so we have about 20 or so minutes for [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2979.18s)]
*  questions and if we can get quick questions we can get quick answers and fit in as many as possible [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2985.18s)]
*  so i'll try to take two at a time this gentleman in the front wait for the microphone and if you can [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2991.2599999999998s)]
*  be brief and introduce yourself as well my name is sufi lagari with the sindhi foundation [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=2996.62s)]
*  just report today came in religious freedom and iran has 300 sufis for sentences [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3004.2999999999997s)]
*  bahá'ís in problem kurdish is in problem avaz is in problem baloch is in problem [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3012.14s)]
*  i think administration should take not just to as a regime but this mullah is a problem everywhere [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3019.42s)]
*  if we countering the iran we should not forget about the wahhabi islam i'm from that region [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3026.62s)]
*  both are major problem i don't know how to when you're countering the iran also we have to not [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3033.58s)]
*  forget about this wahhabi slum okay thank you very much there was a gentleman here in front [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3040.14s)]
*  hi my name is benjamin weill up until recently the international policy advisor the israeli [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3048.22s)]
*  minister of energy who's a security cabinet member my question is regarding the peace talks [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3053.42s)]
*  that we were talking about in the agreement that seems to tackle one of the legs that iran stands [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3060.62s)]
*  on which is the nuclear program but then there's the other regional problem whether it's his bala [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3066.46s)]
*  hamas houthis etc and i think that these sanctions are geared to tackle that problem i was wondering [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3070.54s)]
*  if you see one solution for both those problems or maybe there needs to be a more complex solution [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3079.02s)]
*  that'll tackle the internal nuclear problem and the more regional one of support to terrorist [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3086.14s)]
*  activity in the region thank you why don't we take one more is there any anyone in the back [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3092.06s)]
*  please in the front here [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3097.26s)]
*  barbara pladasher from the bbc could you all maybe just briefly talk about what you think the game [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3101.7400000000002s)]
*  plan of this administration is you've you've alluded to it in different ways but if you would [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3109.1s)]
*  just say what you think the administration is actually up to if indeed it does have a game plan [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3114.38s)]
*  um sure just very quickly i mean on game plan um you know on on the face of it the game plan [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3119.4199999999996s)]
*  would be as i was suggesting before uh producing through maximum pressure either the capitulation [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3126.7s)]
*  of this regime not the negotiation of a better deal or its implosion now i don't think i share [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3133.4199999999996s)]
*  the views of my colleagues i don't think president trump himself is a military interventionist [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3139.58s)]
*  but it remains um you know sort of opaque to me about whether there's a serious negotiating [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3144.2999999999997s)]
*  strategy here or not um so that's how i'd respond to that question [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3151.02s)]
*  i think that there is a a consensus within the administration that includes the president that [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3158.86s)]
*  pressure is good and pressure for the sake of pressure may produce a desired outcome now the [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3164.94s)]
*  president would prefer negotiations um much of the rest of the senior cabinet appears to prefer [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3170.38s)]
*  either something that looks like a capitulation or an implosion but for the moment they're all [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3176.14s)]
*  agreed upon a strategy of maximum pressure and it plays into this presumption that that many hold [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3181.26s)]
*  that you know iran will bend but it won't bend to a little bit of pressure you need a lot on the [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3187.34s)]
*  question about whether there's one solution for everything with iran i think that's a good [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3192.94s)]
*  solution for everything with iran i think again this is the experiment we're living out in real [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3197.9s)]
*  time the criticism of the jcpoa was that it didn't deal with the non-nuclear issues and that was of [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3203.02s)]
*  course by design it was designed in fact by the bush administration president obama took most of [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3208.94s)]
*  the criticism for it but the negotiations were never intended to address the wider array of [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3213.5s)]
*  issues what i worry about is the fact that the trump administration's action in terms of [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3219.26s)]
*  withdrawing or walking away from the jcpoa has tainted the idea of transactionalism with iran [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3224.06s)]
*  the concept that you can solve one problem continue to disagree on others and look for [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3230.14s)]
*  solutions on them i think it's going to be much more difficult to strike and sustain a narrow [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3235.02s)]
*  bargain narrows meaning to one set of issues rather than the others and i say that though i'm [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3242.06s)]
*  completely uh uh an completely pessimistic throughout the course of my career that there [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3247.58s)]
*  is a grand bargain to be had with iran it simply isn't there but i think we are facing a structural [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3253.9s)]
*  problem in engaging with iran in the future in that we have now i think validated the the fears [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3259.5s)]
*  and the paranoia of the senior leadership that one small set of concessions will only lead to pressure [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3267.98s)]
*  for concessions on everything else on the first question i think look there is a legitimate [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3274.14s)]
*  concern about wabas influence the saudis in the past obviously have funded a variety of initiatives [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3282.22s)]
*  that promoted that we have seen all of us i think have seen the effects in places in europe bosnia [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3294.14s)]
*  where i spent a year there was an influence of this what has been encouraging certainly there are [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3301.74s)]
*  some issues that give you great disquiet but what has been encouraging with the vision 2030 [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3310.7799999999997s)]
*  in saudi arabia is an explicit commitment to dial that back quite considerably and to promote a [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3318.54s)]
*  degree of moderation in the practice of islam even inside the kingdom and it's not as widely [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3325.82s)]
*  recognized because it was not broad news but the the crown prince also replaced some 50 or so [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3332.6200000000003s)]
*  clerics hardline clerics i don't know a year a year and a half ago somewhere around that time [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3341.5800000000004s)]
*  as part of the effort to again promote a degree again everything is relative of moderation [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3347.58s)]
*  on the the regional activities of iran i do want to just build a little bit on what suzanne said [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3358.7000000000003s)]
*  about this earlier i do think it's a reasonable question to ask whether or not the sanctions are [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3368.2200000000003s)]
*  finally going to reduce iran's capacity to continue to fund lebanese is bala bishar al-assad [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3375.1s)]
*  militia in iraq militia perhaps the houthis in yemen some other actors in bahrain or wherever [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3385.8199999999997s)]
*  again a smaller scale this is going to become i think increasingly difficult in a sense to sell [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3393.3399999999997s)]
*  to the public not that they do have to sell it but it does ultimately come out there have been [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3401.18s)]
*  disclosures about how much money has gone to these different activities and the iranian people are [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3406.2999999999997s)]
*  going to say my gosh look what you have done to our economy because of your nefarious activities [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3411.98s)]
*  or your support of these different groups abroad we're the ones who are tightening the belt [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3417.8199999999997s)]
*  at least spend the money at home and don't keep digging ourselves a bigger hole [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3424.7799999999997s)]
*  and then when it comes to the game plan for the administration i think the big question here is [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3430.3s)]
*  are the 12 demands that secretary pompeo announced in his speech i guess at heritage [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3436.54s)]
*  not long after he became the secretary of state are these opening positions for negotiation [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3442.46s)]
*  or are these absolutely non-negotiable i tend to think that they are the former [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3450.3s)]
*  but again we will have to see over time whether that's the case and i don't expect anything in [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3456.8599999999997s)]
*  the next few months perhaps even in the remainder of this year the big question is at a certain [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3462.3799999999997s)]
*  point in time in the next year whether or not the iranians calculate that they just again [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3468.3799999999997s)]
*  grit their teeth until the election in hopes of a change or if they agree to come to the table then [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3473.8999999999996s)]
*  some more questions this gentleman here in the center [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3481.74s)]
*  working [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3486.22s)]
*  thank you uh peter shutley retired state department foreign service what is the risk that net and yahoo [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3501.4199999999996s)]
*  will look at the situation and say we have a limited window of opportunity [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3508.7799999999997s)]
*  uh trump may not be around after two more years now is the time to take some military action [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3513.8999999999996s)]
*  against iran and we've got the u.s on our side what's the risk of that can i answer that very [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3520.06s)]
*  quickly and just say that the window of opportunity closed back when bill was i think still the [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3525.8199999999997s)]
*  undersecretary and i was the director of the cia gentleman here in the front microphone [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3531.58s)]
*  that's slightly tongue-in-cheek but not entirely [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3538.7s)]
*  several years following chairman howard berman's leadership of the foreign affairs committee [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3544.54s)]
*  maybe you didn't have the mics just briefly introduce yourself uh jim moran uh and uh serving [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3548.8599999999997s)]
*  the congress for the law uh i wanted you to address uh a couple of issues one is the concept of an [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3556.06s)]
*  arab nato and whether this is not problematic in terms of our long-term objectives another is [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3564.14s)]
*  the fact that the president has supported mbs's support of general hafter's assault on the [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3574.06s)]
*  government of libya which we have supported as has the united nations seems to be a precedent for [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3581.9s)]
*  further mischief and uh and dissolution of our long-term plans for the region but let me just [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3589.98s)]
*  say i couldn't agree more with your insight that iran seizes opportunities that are created by [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3596.7000000000003s)]
*  these authoritarian unenlightened arab leaders and and that may be the source much of the source of [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3605.26s)]
*  the problem we have thank you thank you i was just going to say i guess my answer to your two [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3611.42s)]
*  questions congressman would be first i think the first is an illusion the idea of an arab nato in [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3616.06s)]
*  any formal sense we've seen this movie before going back 60 years it rarely pans out that's [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3620.94s)]
*  not to suggest that there aren't as general petraeus knows better than anybody lots of ways in [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3626.7799999999997s)]
*  which we can coordinate militarily but the idea of a formal alliance like that is an illusion and [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3630.38s)]
*  the second on support for general heftar i think is foolish um you know i think you know libya lord [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3635.82s)]
*  knows has more than its share of fragilities and insecurities right now but i think it's foolish [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3641.82s)]
*  to assume that there's a military solution here the general heftar is going to produce and so i [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3646.7000000000003s)]
*  think all anybody who's supporting him is doing right now you know including the president's phone [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3651.1800000000003s)]
*  call to him and you know apparent support um is just going to produce more hardship more trouble [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3656.54s)]
*  for a society that has more than its share already i just build on the first one and great to see you [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3663.26s)]
*  again congressman and former chairman um you know when i was a central command commander we thought [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3669.1s)]
*  that the most important way in which you could integrate capabilities and this is without any [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3676.62s)]
*  kind of alliance structure or military force was just to start by integrating the ballistic missile [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3682.2999999999997s)]
*  threat warning system which was not integrated by the way it was a common system generally [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3693.18s)]
*  built on u.s. early warning radars and patriots and a variety of others and we had a lot of [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3699.1s)]
*  as you may recall we had batteries of patriots in just about every country up and down the gulf [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3706.38s)]
*  this was at a time when cutter was still a member in good standing of the gcc that is obviously not [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3711.18s)]
*  the case now and frankly we could never actually get them to even allow the others to see their [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3717.9s)]
*  feeds in other words what their radars the radars on their soil that they owned were actually [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3724.7799999999997s)]
*  identifying and so i mean that seemed to me to be a relatively low bar to get over if you really [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3731.2599999999998s)]
*  wanted to coordinate activity there's nothing offensive about it it's entirely defensive [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3737.4199999999996s)]
*  and in the end central command ended up by default being the integrator in other words we had the [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3743.3399999999997s)]
*  feeds of all of them and then we would put it together in our own ballistic missile defense [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3749.18s)]
*  system so gosh if you can't get to that back in the days when again generally the gcc was together [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3754.62s)]
*  there were always some reservations by some of the the gulf states that cutter had relationships [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3762.3799999999997s)]
*  with iran that were a bit concerning some of that again is just reality they share the biggest oil [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3770.22s)]
*  one of the biggest gas fields in the world and had to have a relationship [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3776.38s)]
*  but if you couldn't get that gosh it's really hard to envision something like a nato and [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3780.62s)]
*  especially now that one of the key gcc members has really been cast out from the fold not from [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3787.34s)]
*  the gcc but certainly is being cut off in a variety of other ways we have time for two quick more [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3793.42s)]
*  questions in the way back i see a hand [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3801.66s)]
*  hello this is gabriela barbati with voice of america for general petraeus i would like to [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3808.8599999999997s)]
*  know what's your take about the comments by iran's foreign minister jawad zarif about the fact that [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3813.5s)]
*  the u.s administration may be lured into war by quote accidents and i would add also what if [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3819.74s)]
*  iran intervened somehow in the straight of her moves thank you very much [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3827.82s)]
*  anyone else okay why don't we start with you and over trace and then suzanne and sure any final [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3833.02s)]
*  thoughts i look i think it would be very very unwise uh were iran to precipitate some kind of [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3838.7s)]
*  activity in the straight of her moves in general iran has been quite restrained in the kind of [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3848.86s)]
*  activity that characterized some of their actions in the past where they've run a lot of speedboats [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3855.98s)]
*  or these high capacity speedboats at our ships and all the rest of that and turn out off at the last [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3863.02s)]
*  minute they did however run a apparently put a uav unmanned aerial vehicle over one of our large [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3868.86s)]
*  ships in the past week or so at least according to a press report and i haven't had that confirmed [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3876.38s)]
*  from elsewhere but i think they've got to be very careful about this action again as was mentioned [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3883.02s)]
*  earlier president trump from their perspective presumably a bit less predictable perhaps less [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3889.34s)]
*  restrained if they provoke something and you don't know where that goes as we all well know i mean [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3899.9s)]
*  when you roll the iron dice who knows where tell me how this ends as someone said on the road to [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3906.54s)]
*  baghdad in the idea that that the administration will be lured into war again i again think that [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3913.5s)]
*  that is pretty unlikely as i mentioned earlier i think opportunities by any other country [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3925.5s)]
*  in the region to [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3935.98s)]
*  do significant damage to some of the components of the iran program [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3939.66s)]
*  this was limited all the way back in again 2010 or 2011 and the idea that again that [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3945.74s)]
*  that when someone would try to calculate what could happen i think is is really somewhat [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3954.7s)]
*  questionable i i just don't see this happening then bill uh we're in as i said the 40th anniversary [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3962.78s)]
*  of the islamic republic and i guess for both of your final thoughts i'm curious and it's never [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3970.2200000000003s)]
*  wise to make predictions about iran but where do you envision we could potentially become the 50th [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3975.9s)]
*  anniversary the societal political trend lines and for bill what would be a wise u.s policy to [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3982.46s)]
*  ensure that it's it does transition to something more positive i have tried to steer away from [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3989.26s)]
*  making predictions because as anyone who knows iran knows it's absolutely impossible to predict [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=3997.5s)]
*  with any degree of accuracy what may happen in that country i also recall being part of a group [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4003.34s)]
*  of people who are watching uh the iranian president addressed the un secure the un general assembly [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4008.94s)]
*  back in 2000 when it was the year of the dialogue of civilizations and we took a set of predictions [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4015.58s)]
*  about when a u.s embassy might reopen in tehran i was the least optimistic of the group and i [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4021.34s)]
*  predicted 2009 and i will note that one of the one of the people who was part of that conversation [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4027.34s)]
*  is now sitting in a prison cell in iran so let me with that caveat say that i think that iran is [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4032.2999999999997s)]
*  well positioned to make a stable transition to some sort of better governance it's [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4039.74s)]
*  it's simply unparalleled in terms of the the capacity of a system that has already had this [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4047.4199999999996s)]
*  sort of wrestling with authoritarianism wrestling with the role of religion and politics in which [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4053.4199999999996s)]
*  there is a now a really well-honed experience with the mechanics of democracy if not the the realities [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4059.9799999999996s)]
*  of a truly representative government there's been more than a century of debate among iranians about [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4067.1s)]
*  how to get accountability from its from their own leadership but that said when and how that [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4072.22s)]
*  transition happens i think is entirely impossible to predict and i think it's very unlikely to come [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4078.06s)]
*  under the type of catastrophic economic pressure that is being applied to iran today and is going [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4084.62s)]
*  to be applied for the foreseeable future there's simply no precedent for that kind of hardship [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4090.7799999999997s)]
*  producing a transition to a more responsible set of leaders and what i think we haven't really [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4097.0199999999995s)]
*  thought through are the potential inadvertent consequences of the current policy outside of [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4103.5s)]
*  the the real risks of some kind of military escalation what does it do to the the prospects [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4109.099999999999s)]
*  for some kind of much more positive transition in iran in the long term and if regime implosion [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4115.66s)]
*  brings regime change of a type that actually produces a less responsible and a more dictatorial [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4124.0599999999995s)]
*  and a more dangerous set of actors led by some of the people that general petraeus has had to deal [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4131.0199999999995s)]
*  with before i think in fact we could be facing a potential outcome which is much worse than the one [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4137.18s)]
*  that we faced today general did you want i actually just wanted to qualify the very quick [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4144.7s)]
*  response i gave earlier about the window of vulnerability that's based basically on an [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4150.22s)]
*  assumption that there is not a resumption of the nuclear program but it i mean it is a reality [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4154.86s)]
*  about the cape of through the qualities of the different elements of that program [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4161.9s)]
*  but assuming there's not something now if that happens then i think all bets are off perhaps [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4168.22s)]
*  even with the united states and that's when i think you start to get really concerned [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4174.62s)]
*  so build your diplomatic efforts help prevent iran from becoming like north korea is there [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4178.94s)]
*  us policy that could help iran become like south korea no i mean i think the one thing i've learned [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4184.38s)]
*  over many years in the middle east is the limits of us agency and our ability to affect regime [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4190.7s)]
*  change in a sensible way or even to predict as susanne was trying to do the evolution of [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4196.86s)]
*  another society having said that i share susanne's view that you know i do think we ought to approach [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4204.219999999999s)]
*  iran's future with a certain amount of confidence in the following sense i don't think the [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4210.219999999999s)]
*  current theocratic leaders in that regime have answers for what's on the mind of a very young [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4215.179999999999s)]
*  population 70 percent of which today is under the age of 30 having said that i just think there's a [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4220.7s)]
*  smart way and a dumb way for the united states to manage what is a very complicated and largely [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4226.38s)]
*  adversarial relationship between now and then and you know as i've suggested before i think the [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4232.38s)]
*  smarter way is not to operate with illusions to push back on behavior which threatens us in the [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4237.9800000000005s)]
*  interests of our friends not to be shy about human rights issues but to selectively engage and as [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4243.5s)]
*  susanne said be transactional in places where you can reduce not eliminate but reduce some of the [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4249.02s)]
*  most imminent dangers that an unconstrained iranian nuclear program would pose and i think [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4256.3s)]
*  that's that was the essence of the iranian nuclear agreements both the interim agreement and then [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4261.900000000001s)]
*  the comprehensive one they did not solve the totality of threats that this iranian regime [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4267.18s)]
*  posed but i think they were a way of managing that relationship and i think that approach that broad [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4273.26s)]
*  strategy still makes sense for the united states well i want to thank you all very much for coming [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4279.42s)]
*  and thank those who have been watching online in iran and in the u.s and join me in thanking the [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aauLS5TVGGA&t=4284.94s)]
