# Security Challenges and Governance: Egypt, Morocco, and Yemen
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [September 07, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU)
*  Our Carnegie Stanford workshop on security, prosperity, and governance in the Middle East [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=0.0s)]
*  and North Africa. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=6.1000000000000005s)]
*  My name is Ambra Hamzawi. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  I'm a senior fellow at the Center for Democracy, Development, and Rule of Law at Stanford and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=8.6s)]
*  a non-resident fellow at Carnegie. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=14.96s)]
*  And I'm happy to be with you and happy to moderate our second panel. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=19.3s)]
*  We had a first panel which tackled primarily economic issues as they relate to governance [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=24.82s)]
*  and human security. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=33.64s)]
*  And in the second panel, we are devoting our attention to security. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=35.9s)]
*  I wouldn't say security proper, but we will tackle security challenges, human security [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=40.66s)]
*  challenges, as well as other security challenges in three key countries in the Middle East [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=47.0s)]
*  and North Africa in the order beside me, Egypt, Morocco, and Yemen. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=53.58s)]
*  And we have three excellent panelists who will enlighten us and share their remarks and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=62.739999999999995s)]
*  then engage with you in hopefully what's going to be a vibrant Q&A session. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=67.08s)]
*  We have Nancy Aukail to my right. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=73.18s)]
*  Nancy is the executive director of the Tahrir Institute based in Washington, D.C. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=76.88s)]
*  Samia Arzouhi, she is a PhD candidate at U.S. Davis in the history department. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=84.58s)]
*  And she worked for a few years as a writer's correspondent in Morocco. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=94.17999999999999s)]
*  And we have also a colleague in Beirut, who is a fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=101.02s)]
*  in Beirut and a co-founder of the Sanaa Center for Strategic Studies. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=105.06s)]
*  Let me welcome all of you. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=111.97999999999999s)]
*  We are very happy that you could all make it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=112.97999999999999s)]
*  And let's start right away by asking you, Nancy, to reflect on – and I'm going to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=117.89999999999999s)]
*  ask Samia and Farah to do exactly the same. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=125.5s)]
*  If you can, Nancy, reflect on the current security situation in Egypt in 2017, if you [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=128.58s)]
*  could share with us what you consider to be the main security challenges, main improvements [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=136.18s)]
*  with regard to human security or lag thereof since the last major political shift in Egypt [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=142.02s)]
*  took place, which was in 2013. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=149.54000000000002s)]
*  Thank you, Amin. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=153.14s)]
*  Thanks for inviting me. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=157.61999999999998s)]
*  It's really great to be on a panel with Samia and Farah. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=160.61999999999998s)]
*  She's got great experience in this. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=163.29999999999998s)]
*  Should I raise my voice more? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=165.82s)]
*  Maybe – is that better? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=168.77999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=172.77999999999997s)]
*  OK. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=173.77999999999997s)]
*  So, well, the short answer to your question, the security situation is going down. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=175.62s)]
*  I mean, it's not improving. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=185.26s)]
*  And it's a huge disappointment for a lot of people who basically supported President [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=188.26s)]
*  Sisi in 2013 mainly on the nexus of the idea of security and economic improvement. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=193.58s)]
*  And we see – I mean, in 2017 today, both indicators of both areas are not looking good [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=203.5s)]
*  at all. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=212.01999999999998s)]
*  The economy is going down. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=213.01999999999998s)]
*  And also the security situation is deteriorating, particularly in Sinai. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=215.38s)]
*  Since 2013, more vigilant and more established terror organizations are forming and finding [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=221.62s)]
*  place in a home in Egypt. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=229.89999999999998s)]
*  The level of terror attacks that are – that we have been tracking at the Tahrir Institute [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=232.46s)]
*  shows that an upward trend, even, for example, when sometimes the number of terror attacks [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=238.98000000000002s)]
*  – if we're talking quantitatively first before we go into the analysis. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=246.66000000000003s)]
*  So for example, the last – the first quarter of 2017 saw a bit of a decline of the number [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=251.14000000000001s)]
*  of attacks in Egypt, going around 136 attacks during that time. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=257.3s)]
*  However, the number of fatalities of these attacks have increased. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=264.3s)]
*  So it's – if in economic terms, that looks like the terror groups are being more efficient, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=269.94000000000005s)]
*  doing less and achieving more. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=277.1s)]
*  So looking at these numbers qualitatively, the number of attacks, the number of fatalities, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=279.78000000000003s)]
*  the targeted attacks, it's going up. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=285.02s)]
*  So that's not looking good. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=287.5s)]
*  But also symbolically, how these organizations or terror groups are being established, feeling [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=289.74s)]
*  comfortable, and they are innovating their ways of communicating and improving their [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=296.18s)]
*  media propaganda. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=304.14s)]
*  They know exactly what are the issues that they play on when they are, for example, trying [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=305.14s)]
*  to recruit. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=312.9s)]
*  So they know exactly what are the most contentious issues, particularly political issues, that [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=314.1s)]
*  they play on when they send on the propaganda video inviting people to join the groups. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=319.74s)]
*  Now a lot of people – and this is a simple correlation between – it's not really that [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=326.34000000000003s)]
*  simple that it's not every country that has an economic decline suffers terrorism. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=337.66s)]
*  At the same time, not every person with a fundamentalist view acts upon it with violence. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=342.3s)]
*  It's a combination that a formula that exists right now in Egypt that is taking the country [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=348.14s)]
*  into this very worrying and concerning situation. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=353.66s)]
*  So just to speak about Sinai, and you're going to find some comparable situations in [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=357.7s)]
*  Yemen and Morocco. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=363.94s)]
*  So in Sinai, the idea of isolation is not just an economic isolation. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=365.9s)]
*  It's about, first of all, communications. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=372.3s)]
*  Communications going in and out. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=375.98s)]
*  So for example, the northern Sinai have had the communications completely cut – just [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=377.58s)]
*  actually came back today, that the communications started to come back to it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=384.06s)]
*  Electricity has been cut for two months. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=390.78000000000003s)]
*  It only came back on the 30th of August. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=393.5s)]
*  Today, there was a statement that was distributed by the company of Walter Utility saying that [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=397.62s)]
*  they're going to evacuate everything and all the services. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=405.14s)]
*  So this is a situation that from one side is putting the populations there at distress. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=409.74s)]
*  But this combination works particularly well for the terror groups because the terror groups [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=416.78000000000003s)]
*  are not good at governance. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=423.7s)]
*  They are good at inflicting harm, but they're not able or good at building societies. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=426.02000000000004s)]
*  So it's a situation for them that they don't have to – there are no civic services that [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=433.82000000000005s)]
*  are there that they have to keep, that they have to serve. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=439.94s)]
*  They are dealing with a situation of basically for them warriors, and it's normal to be [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=442.86s)]
*  in that situation. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=448.94s)]
*  So it's a combination from the side of the government unable to serve the population [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=450.74s)]
*  there, and it works very well for the people there. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=455.94s)]
*  So it further leads to the deterioration of the situation, and also it's an opportunity [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=459.94s)]
*  for the terror groups to recruit. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=467.18s)]
*  Now the other thing that works then, when you have nothing to offer – I mean, you're [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=471.34000000000003s)]
*  not offering things – and I'm talking – this situation is ironically very comparable [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=478.58s)]
*  between the government and between the terror groups. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=483.06s)]
*  And the biggest terror group in Sinai that formerly known as Ansar Bitelmaqdis, now [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=486.06s)]
*  Wilaid Sinai, that is affiliated to ISIS. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=491.62s)]
*  And despite of the defeat in ISIS everywhere, it still symbolically gives them a prestige [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=495.66s)]
*  to pose themselves this way. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=500.9s)]
*  And although, as I said, when you don't have something to offer, you work very hard [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=505.94000000000005s)]
*  on the narrative, on the media narrative. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=510.3s)]
*  So from the side of the government, there is an intense effort to control the media. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=512.34s)]
*  From one side, there are 125 websites in Egypt that's been fucked. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=521.62s)]
*  And on the other side, the government is investing very heavily on controlling the media and [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=526.62s)]
*  creating new channels. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=533.9s)]
*  intelligence itself has created its own TV channel to control the message. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=534.9s)]
*  On the other hand, when you have this information gap, because there is no communication, particularly [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=539.9s)]
*  I'm talking now about Sinai, this gives an opportunity for the terror groups to dominate [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=546.9s)]
*  the net, because they're very clever at doing this. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=551.9s)]
*  They're not really that powerful. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=554.9s)]
*  Their numbers, by the highest estimate, does not increase 1000 people. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=558.3s)]
*  But because they are very good at working on social media, over Twitter and things, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=564.3s)]
*  and there's no counter-narrative, they are able to exaggerate their presence. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=570.3s)]
*  They, for example, would set up a checkpoint for 15 minutes, take videos of it, and show [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=576.3s)]
*  that they are in control. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=581.3s)]
*  And they show an appearance of governance rather than actual governance. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=583.6999999999999s)]
*  They also, in April, they showed this, they launched this propaganda video showing how [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=587.6999999999999s)]
*  systemic they are. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=596.6999999999999s)]
*  The snipers. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=599.6999999999999s)]
*  Showing, for example, in the course of the video of 17 minutes, 35 military people. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=601.6999999999999s)]
*  Showing that their capabilities are very low. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=609.1s)]
*  Where, at the same time, in the same video, showing those from the side of the Egyptian [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=614.1s)]
*  military looking very informal, not even wearing the formal attire, army, just being shot randomly. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=621.1s)]
*  So this is a certain message showing, basically, the bottom line, we are in control. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=630.1s)]
*  So that's really problematic. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=636.1s)]
*  Maybe later when we talk about Yemen, and I don't want to take much time, but also the [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=638.5s)]
*  way of the tribal relations, like tribes like the Caribbean, and their infighting with ISIS [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=643.5s)]
*  outside of the control of... [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=651.5s)]
*  also makes the situation. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=654.5s)]
*  Thank you very much, Nancy. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=657.5s)]
*  Samia, headlines coming out of Morocco in recent days have been related to two issues. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=659.5s)]
*  One, the long period of negotiation between different political actors represented in [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=667.9s)]
*  parliament to form a government, which is finally in place. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=674.9s)]
*  And the second piece of news was related to a wave of protests which has unfolded primarily [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=678.9s)]
*  in the reef region. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=685.9s)]
*  So you get a different picture when compared to Egypt, when compared to many countries [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=687.9s)]
*  in the region. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=693.9s)]
*  Morocco seems to be a country where we do have a degree of formalized politics and political [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=696.3s)]
*  dynamics being carried out in democratically-legitimated institutions. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=701.3s)]
*  Parliament was elected recently. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=706.3s)]
*  And on the other side, it seems that Morocco faces a great deal of governance deficits [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=709.3s)]
*  that have eroded human security and have led to that wave of protests which unfolded in [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=714.3s)]
*  the reef region. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=722.3s)]
*  If you could reflect on the current security situation, different challenges, and how they [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=723.6999999999999s)]
*  relate to governance and the role of politics and political actors, government and other [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=727.6999999999999s)]
*  political actors, that would be great. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=733.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=735.6999999999999s)]
*  So it's funny that you bring these two major developments in Morocco because they actually [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=737.6999999999999s)]
*  coincided with one another. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=741.6999999999999s)]
*  The protests in the reef region started in late October after a fish vendor, Mohsin Fikri, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=743.6999999999999s)]
*  was caught selling fish, swordfish specifically, which was illegal to fish during that time [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=750.1s)]
*  of the year. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=754.1s)]
*  His stock was confiscated by police, thrown into a garbage truck where he was subsequently [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=755.1s)]
*  crushed to death. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=759.1s)]
*  The incident was documented on a video and it went viral overnight and automatically [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=761.1s)]
*  immediately triggering protests. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=767.1s)]
*  At the same time that this happened in October, Morocco just had legislative elections that [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=770.1s)]
*  yielded results where the outgoing government led by the party of justice and development, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=775.5s)]
*  Prime Minister Ben-Hiren, not only winning elections but actually gaining seats which, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=780.5s)]
*  you know, despite the unpopularity of his policies, a lot of people were sort of raising [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=785.5s)]
*  questions about what future that would entail for the fact that Ben-Hiren would have been [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=789.5s)]
*  the first prime minister in Moroccan history to serve two consecutive terms as a result [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=794.5s)]
*  of relatively free and transparent elections. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=799.5s)]
*  To sort of put the protests into context first of all and then the government negotiations [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=802.9s)]
*  blockage issue, when the protests started happening in the reef, the rallying cry was [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=807.9s)]
*  hugra, and hugra is essentially this concept of the deprivation of dignity. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=813.9s)]
*  And as a result, a group of locals from Al-Husayma decided to form a small little movement which [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=818.9s)]
*  would be now referred to as Hirak Al-Shaabi or the Popular Movement. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=825.9s)]
*  And they drew lessons from the failures of past protest movements in Morocco, namely [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=829.3s)]
*  the February 20th Movement. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=833.3s)]
*  They did this by actually spending three months knocking door to door in the city of Husayma [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=835.3s)]
*  and the neighboring towns and villages asking people what their grievances were. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=841.3s)]
*  And the result of this was a manifesto with very succinct demands that included having [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=845.3s)]
*  a cancer facility because the reef region has the highest rate of cancer. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=850.6999999999999s)]
*  This is actually attributed to the use of chemical weapons during the war with Spain [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=854.5s)]
*  in the 1920s and a university in addition to improved infrastructure, namely the construction [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=859.1s)]
*  of a highway that would have connected Husayma to the rest of the country which has still [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=868.1s)]
*  been on hold despite it was supposed to be completed last year and jobs essentially. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=872.1s)]
*  So the Hirak also distinguishes itself from the February 20th Movement because it actually [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=879.1s)]
*  had a leader, his name was Nasser Zevzeffi and he was very public and at the forefront [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=884.7s)]
*  and as a result he was subsequently arrested in May. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=887.7s)]
*  And following his arrest over 300 people have now been arrested since May. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=890.7s)]
*  Protests happening if not on a daily basis, almost on a weekly basis and the most sort [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=896.7s)]
*  of violent and extensive use of violence on behalf of the security forces in Morocco in [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=901.7s)]
*  the reef region, deployment of a disproportionate amount of riot police, gendarmes and other [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=908.7s)]
*  forms of security, use of tear gas, truncheons that eventually led to the death of one protester [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=914.7s)]
*  and dozens that were subsequently injured. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=919.7s)]
*  The reason why the reef region protests are sort of unique and this touches on the issue [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=922.9000000000001s)]
*  of isolation that Nancy was bringing up, the reef is actually geographically isolated with [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=928.1s)]
*  the reef mountains, that's one aspect. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=932.7s)]
*  It's also sort of historically isolated from the general narrative of Moroccan history [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=935.0s)]
*  and what we see is that the past three monarchs in Morocco have had to deal with social and [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=941.0s)]
*  political unrest in the reef at one point in their reigns and each time that it has [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=947.0s)]
*  come up it hasn't effectively been resolved and addressed. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=951.0s)]
*  The socioeconomic and political marginalization issues have never fully been addressed. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=955.0s)]
*  You have Mohammed the Fifth in the 1920s with the brief establishment of the Reef Republic [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=958.0s)]
*  which was essentially squashed by the Spanish army led by Colonel Franco who actually used [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=963.0s)]
*  the reef war as a platform for climbing to the ranks and eventually becoming dictator [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=969.0s)]
*  and essentially the Sultan Mohammed the Fifth at the time just sort of tacitly sat aside [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=974.0s)]
*  and did not intervene in any way shape or form. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=980.0s)]
*  That is still very vivid in the minds and memories of people in the reef. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=983.0s)]
*  And then you have Hassan the Second who in the 1980s in response to bread riots that [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=987.0s)]
*  were a result of increase in food prices prompted by structural adjustment measures [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=992.0s)]
*  addressed the protesters in the reef. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=997.0s)]
*  Now mind you there were protests happening all over the country during the 1980s because [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1000.0s)]
*  of these structural adjustment measures and in a speech he notoriously singled out the reef [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1003.0s)]
*  calling them scum and basically saying that they live off of theft and trafficking here [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1008.0s)]
*  referring to the hash trafficking that you know the reef is notorious for. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1014.0s)]
*  And that itself has also remained very vivid in the memories and the minds of the people in the reef [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1020.0s)]
*  and this sort of terminology used against the protesters by Hassan the Second has been [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1025.0s)]
*  revived currently by newspapers that have strong ties to various parties and the state. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1031.0s)]
*  And now we have Mohammed the Sixth who is essentially going through a similar situation [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1038.0s)]
*  of political and social unrest in the reef and his response has been a sort of a combination [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1043.0s)]
*  of public ambivalence. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1048.0s)]
*  He mentioned Huseimah once in speech in Throne Day at the Spastulae and basically he mentioned [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1049.0s)]
*  Huseimah once in the context of praising the quote unquote restraint of security forces [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1055.0s)]
*  and contrary actually two days ago or yesterday the Human Rights Watch published a report [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1060.0s)]
*  saying that the king is essentially condoning these violent security tactics. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1065.0s)]
*  So all three monarchs have failed to address what's going on in the reef and so I think that [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1069.0s)]
*  this is just yet another critical juncture in a regime that is very path dependent [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1075.0s)]
*  and has missed a lot of opportunities for forging sort of a more like sense and system of governance [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1081.0s)]
*  that does you know prioritize accountability and now going into the issue with the government [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1089.0s)]
*  sort of we had the 2016 elections and to prevent this rise of Vinky Ran I mean sort of [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1096.0s)]
*  just to put this sort of to bring up an anecdote I was speaking to a government official earlier [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1104.0s)]
*  this year asking his opinion on what's happening with the king forcing Vinky Ran to step aside [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1110.0s)]
*  and instead choosing a lot many who is perceived as a more docile figure in the party. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1116.0s)]
*  He told me listen there can't be two sons in Morocco and I think this sort of characterizes [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1120.0s)]
*  the dual executive nature of the Moroccan state you have the king and you have the prime minister [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1126.0s)]
*  and you know the power that is shared between them is not equal. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1131.0s)]
*  The government does respond and is sort of held to account by the by the monarchy [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1135.0s)]
*  and this is one of the issues of governance and so when the Herak protest started happening [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1140.0s)]
*  accountability was tossed around like a hot potato. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1145.0s)]
*  You had the king, the monarchy, the palace that was sort of stepping aside saying you know [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1148.0s)]
*  this is not our issue the government needs to deal with it. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1153.0s)]
*  The government run and led by the PJD is saying well no we held we don't hold the power [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1155.0s)]
*  we don't hold the majority of the seats in the leaf they actually are held by the opposition party [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1160.0s)]
*  the party of authenticity and modernity which is a party founded by a close friend of the king [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1165.0s)]
*  and current royal advisor. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1170.0s)]
*  So I think this is emblematic of how the dual executive nature of the Moroccan state functions [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1172.0s)]
*  and so I think that in some unless genuine political economic and social policies of inclusion [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1178.0s)]
*  are put into place the reef protest may subside in the short term but I think that they will likely [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1186.0s)]
*  recur and other protests similar to that will happen in the country. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1192.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1196.0s)]
*  To you Farah, Yemen is one of the Arab countries which is suffering from all possible challenges. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1198.0s)]
*  Human security issues are a grave condition from human security and I'm referring to recent news. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1214.0s)]
*  We don't get to hear much about Yemen be it in the US or in fact in the Arab world and that is very much [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1227.0s)]
*  related to the fact that politics and political interests has moved away from Yemen apart from [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1233.0s)]
*  the regional actors involved in a war of aggression on Yemen itself but there were recent reports by [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1240.0s)]
*  international organizations on the health conditions of Yemeni children, Yemeni women, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1247.0s)]
*  on levels of cholera, endemic spread of cholera and other human security challenges. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1252.0s)]
*  Yemen has been facing a war of aggression from neighboring countries, Saudi led coalition, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1262.0s)]
*  but a civil war in Yemen as well. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1269.0s)]
*  Yemen, Yemen state has never been a strong state, has never delivered basic services but whatever delivery [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1271.0s)]
*  existed before the last two years is probably gone. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1277.0s)]
*  So if you can reflect on the security situation in Yemen and feel free to bring in domestic and regional dynamics [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1281.0s)]
*  because international dynamics cannot be dealt with away from regional actors and what they do. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1290.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1297.0s)]
*  Yemen, one way to explain the low silence of the media is we say we are Mexico, the Gulf. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1299.0s)]
*  The same way the Gulf thinks of Yemen is similar to how some Americans think of Mexico. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1306.0s)]
*  That's one of the reasons I think why it's a very, not an unknown story, but an untold, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1312.0s)]
*  it's a country of untold stories and issues. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1318.0s)]
*  With security specifically there is two themes. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1322.0s)]
*  One is probably a principle and one is a technical problem that I think has led the country into this level of insecurity. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1325.0s)]
*  The principle was a principle that drift in 2011 via the GCC deal and via many other things that were happening. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1333.0s)]
*  Which was this trading of justice for the sake of security. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1341.0s)]
*  When someone does a problem or an institution violates human rights or whatever, it's traded for the sake of security. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1347.0s)]
*  What did that do ultimately? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1355.0s)]
*  We ended up losing both security and justice. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1357.0s)]
*  And this is the principle that we have violated in conflict resolutions post 2011 has been one of the main problems of security in the Arab world. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1361.0s)]
*  In the past it was the counter-terrorism security. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1369.0s)]
*  If a regime or Mubarak or if Saleh allows a drone strike or have a good relationship with the US, he's fine to do whatever he wants. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1372.0s)]
*  The problem is this formula doesn't work or it's not anymore efficient, even from a pragmatic point of view, let alone a moral point of view. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1379.0s)]
*  And that has, I think, if we zoom out of 2011, look, and this trading of justice was, for example, in Yemen's case, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1388.0s)]
*  very obvious via the unconditional immunity that was given to President Saleh. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1397.0s)]
*  That was very dangerous because this is, it set the legacy of unaccountability and ultimately the legacy of insecurity, I think, that led out of it. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1401.0s)]
*  So that's the principle we violated and that's what we ended up with. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1410.0s)]
*  From a technical point of view, I think the biggest threat to security exists in Yemen and in the region overall is this increasing phenomena of public committees. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1414.0s)]
*  It's a phenomena that is getting very popular all the way from Iraq, Al-Hashd al-Shaabi, for example, the ones fighting ISIS, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1423.0s)]
*  into all the way to Yemen, which is also Lijana al-Shaabiya or the public committees from both sides fighting. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1431.0s)]
*  Ultimately these are parallel armies that reports to no one, that respects no rule, and that basically ultimately end up creating a huge level of insecurity. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1438.0s)]
*  Almost nationalization of security. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1450.0s)]
*  In 2011, security was a family business thing. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1452.0s)]
*  So the president has his two sons in charge of the top security agencies, his third son in charge of intelligence, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1457.0s)]
*  and then his nephew in charge of the counterterrorism unit that was funded by the U.S. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1464.0s)]
*  And the National Security Bureau, obviously one of the most famous intelligence and torture bureaus in Yemen. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1469.0s)]
*  So this was a pure family business, all of security and all of the army. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1476.0s)]
*  We got rid of that and we completely nationalized it into public committees. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1480.0s)]
*  It's no more in the hands of a few people from the family, but basically everyone has their own security. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1485.0s)]
*  And that's a dangerous trend. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1490.0s)]
*  In Yemen, for example, in the case of Sana'a, the Hussis have their own, they call it the public committees. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1493.0s)]
*  They report to no one, they have no rules, and no one can ever say anything to them. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1499.0s)]
*  In Aden, we had what they call the resistance. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1505.0s)]
*  In Ta'as, the Salafis, Abul Abbas, very famous militia. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1509.0s)]
*  So this is a larger problem that's destroying security and that's leading to a larger further insecurities in the upcoming days. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1512.0s)]
*  And this is one reason why also armies have not been able to be built, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1521.0s)]
*  because own or sectarian or different armies have been built on the expense of creating any national army. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1525.0s)]
*  And that's one of the biggest issues we are facing right now. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1532.0s)]
*  Let alone when we add to that is the regional arming. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1535.0s)]
*  So we have a war clearly in Yemen, a combination of a civil war and regional war, a combination of wars. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1539.0s)]
*  The US is involved in, the Gulf is involved in, Iran somehow more or less is involved in, and everyone has been supplying arms to everyone. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1545.0s)]
*  And this is another big issue. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1554.0s)]
*  In Yemen, the UAE created its own military forces in Hadramaut, in Shabwa. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1556.0s)]
*  Saudis funded different military forces, but that's not part of the military at all. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1561.0s)]
*  And that's what happens, I mean, when a war starts and then continues, even though no one really knows why it started or why or what is ultimate. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1567.0s)]
*  So what go large is this. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1575.0s)]
*  I mean, that's from a security point of view is things are problematic. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1578.0s)]
*  Now, I don't also, I think there is a lot of blaming too much against the state and how weak the state is. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1583.0s)]
*  Is there a state in Yemen? Is there a stronger state? No. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1592.0s)]
*  Is there a state that is able to have resources? No. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1595.0s)]
*  But there is a state. There is a state that has been there for 3,000 years since the Queen of Sheba, which the Bible and the Koran speaks of. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1598.0s)]
*  Is it the state we imagine? No. Is it the state that responds to the UN indicators of function? No. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1606.0s)]
*  But it is a state there. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1611.0s)]
*  And I measure that in the fact that if any country like the US goes through 10 percent of the violence Yemen is going through, I think it would have already disappeared from the map. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1613.0s)]
*  But there is a state in Yemen that's deeper than institutions you can measure and you can understand. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1624.0s)]
*  And this state is what keeps more or less societies together in the collapse of institutions like we have right now. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1631.0s)]
*  There is another thing is there isn't at the moment a single institution in Yemen that combines all of these security agencies together. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1638.0s)]
*  And that's the most dangerous thing. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1647.0s)]
*  Yemen is right now fractured into more or less three centers of power, one in Sana'a under the control of the Houthi Saleh, one in Marib under the control of the National Army, some Islamists and some of the President's Alliance, and one in Aden. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1649.0s)]
*  That's not under anyone's control. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1665.0s)]
*  Basically a combination of loose alliances between the Haraq, the southern movement, and some of the Gulf forces there. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1667.0s)]
*  Until nine months ago, these three Yemen's were talking to each other via the central bank. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1674.0s)]
*  We had a central bank that was able to collect revenue from Aden even during the war and base the salaries back to the fighters in Aden from both sides. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1680.0s)]
*  This was a gentleman's agreement that we're not going to destroy this state institution. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1691.0s)]
*  And that was what killed that place or that Yemen in 2-1. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1696.0s)]
*  Since its removal to Aden, a very unthoughtful decision and a practical decision by the President of Yemen, basically the last thing that was uniting Yemen together is actually collapsed since then. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1700.0s)]
*  And now even the militaries, for example, in Aden that are being established or in Sana'a are being established on a sectarian basis. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1711.0s)]
*  There is no way you can really at one point mingle or combine these armies together to create a one army together in Yemen. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1719.0s)]
*  Very much fair. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1729.0s)]
*  Nancy, let me come back to you with a question which goes beyond Sinai. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1732.0s)]
*  So, beyond Sinai, Egyptians have been facing very tough times economically. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1739.0s)]
*  Many segments of the population have been facing tough times politically and be fearing human rights abuses, human rights violations, which have been going up in a massive manner since 2013. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1749.0s)]
*  In fact, one can even argue they never stopped since 2011 in spite of the democratic uprising. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1766.0s)]
*  So how does the situation beyond Sinai look like from a security perspective? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1771.0s)]
*  And how do current security challenges relate to governance failures, economic failures in the sense of creating jobs or distributing income in a more balanced manner? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1778.0s)]
*  Egypt is a place where we have close to 40 percent of the population living below or around the poverty line. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1791.0s)]
*  Yes, before the inflation. So we probably it's it's it went even higher. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1800.0s)]
*  And so be it economic deficits or political deficits, when you close off formal politics, when you cancel or attempt to extinct civil society, independent civil society, what happens? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1806.0s)]
*  What kind of security challenges have been emerging in Egypt away from Sinai? [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1817.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's not any better. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1822.0s)]
*  In. Well, the mainland, just. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1827.0s)]
*  Actually, there are more groups that are. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1833.0s)]
*  Targeting. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1843.0s)]
*  First, the areas. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1847.0s)]
*  Other like very sensitive targets and the number of attacks are also on the rise and more groups are actually forming actually recently. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1852.0s)]
*  We always heard about attacks from ISIS in Egypt without referring to a particular group forming there. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1865.0s)]
*  So we were under the assumptions that they are separate cells that are there. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1872.0s)]
*  However, last spring and in one of the ISIS magazine, just there should had an interview with the end of the ISIS group in Egypt. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1877.0s)]
*  That's different than we laid Sinai. So that's an indication of more. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1891.0s)]
*  I mean, involvement of a particular formation of the group, even if this is not really translate into an actual material. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1895.0s)]
*  Optics of it, that a group of sporadic, I mean, terror attackers are now having some form of coherence and actually a more form of coherence in terms of what messages. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1906.0s)]
*  And on the messaging and. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1920.0s)]
*  So they also had a shift and they know how to play on the weaknesses of the government and explain this shortly. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1922.0s)]
*  So when they started the when the attack started after 2013. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1932.0s)]
*  And was that they are targeting a government that is. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1941.0s)]
*  Illegitimate. Unable to deliver in terms of the needs of society. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1945.0s)]
*  They know exactly how to play on the main political. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1952.0s)]
*  Was inherently. Which is also a shift from the terror attacks that we have seen. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1958.0s)]
*  They are they were targeting government people, not because they are not politically lacking legitimacy, but because they are infidels, because they are not applying Sharia law. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1972.0s)]
*  But the discourse has changed after 2013. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1984.0s)]
*  I can using even terms and and discourse at heart. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1988.0s)]
*  All the failures of the Egyptian government. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=1995.0s)]
*  Actually completely. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2001.0s)]
*  Actually completely. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2002.0s)]
*  Where as the rest of the society is sort of is a fertile ground actually with sort of the sectarian. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2005.0s)]
*  The Christians or Egyptian cops as a target. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2015.0s)]
*  And played very well because they have first of all the currency and second it's an easy target between 2013 until today we've seen five hundred sectarian attacks. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2019.0s)]
*  I mean. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2031.0s)]
*  A president who came actually presenting himself as someone who is trying to fight Islam is not and to protect. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2032.0s)]
*  For fatalities just in. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2041.0s)]
*  Sorry in 2017. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2047.0s)]
*  So you see on on on these fronts this the terror groups are finding so many ways and a fertile ground and opportunities that they play very well. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2050.0s)]
*  In order to first of all define their target and recruit people who are ready and and fed up that the problem is that with the which situation of lack of governance. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2063.0s)]
*  The terror groups are not fighting finding a competing enemy for them. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2075.0s)]
*  So they're not. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2081.0s)]
*  When when you lose everything. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2082.0s)]
*  On providing proper and civic services to people. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2085.0s)]
*  And also in terms of security and all other forms of governance. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2095.0s)]
*  Actually give an opportunity to these groups. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2100.0s)]
*  As you don't have much to lose as the situation now we're not talking about Sinai but everything down from from lower Egypt from Cairo into the south and things also get. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2103.0s)]
*  Or isolation in many other governments where they feel that they actually don't have the same attention that means like. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2116.0s)]
*  Now the Egyptian government instead of actually addressing these issues. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2124.0s)]
*  And also when they talk when when they talk about investments and the work that they they do is they talk about the security and the security of the people who are in the middle of the situation. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2130.0s)]
*  To to to anything significant. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2145.0s)]
*  On the security. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2149.0s)]
*  And also when they talk when when they talk about investments and the work that they they do. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2153.0s)]
*  They do. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2159.0s)]
*  I mean. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2160.0s)]
*  Bones and more. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2161.0s)]
*  Road to help the economy. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2163.0s)]
*  It also goes to irrelevant mega projects. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2166.0s)]
*  Just to make things look as if there is some some sort of delivery on something. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2171.0s)]
*  So having the new capital. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2177.0s)]
*  Capital or the new new Cairo as they have building some mega construction something. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2179.0s)]
*  I mean along the lines of the Pentagon having the octagon or something like that is like ridiculously expensive and unnecessary and raises questions of how the government is spending. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2186.0s)]
*  At a time there is a dire need. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2200.0s)]
*  Of providing subsidy creating projects that actually create employment for for the Egyptian people. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2203.0s)]
*  You said like. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2211.0s)]
*  That was before. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2216.0s)]
*  Reaching. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2220.0s)]
*  To the dollar or a little bit less than that. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2221.0s)]
*  And that's affecting how people are. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2225.0s)]
*  Are are are living their lives and able to barely survive. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2229.0s)]
*  Now in addition to that this creates a dynamic that is very contentious. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2233.0s)]
*  I mean you're having a huge number of the population that are suffering. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2239.0s)]
*  Their their their needs are not met. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2244.0s)]
*  And at the same time there is dynamic where you close all the peaceful political channels of communication with the government. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2247.0s)]
*  The parliament is basically. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2257.0s)]
*  Just not really functioning as a parliament should be as an oversight of the government just basically signing up and any of the decrees or or the decisions made by the government. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2261.0s)]
*  And at the same time you have a very dangerous dynamic. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2274.0s)]
*  The state institutions are are remaining as they have been the same of the powerful ones. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2277.0s)]
*  Yet they feel that they are more vulnerable so they they act on a dynamic of self-preservation. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2288.0s)]
*  So the interior or security sector feels that they have to protect themselves. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2296.0s)]
*  Same thing with the judiciary. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2304.0s)]
*  Out there on as an institute internally they need to have to preserve this institution in order to do that they have a dynamic that sends a message all the time to the rest of the state. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2306.0s)]
*  Their survival depends on them. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2318.0s)]
*  So the more actually there are protests the more there are signs of discomfort or dismay or or in anger in the streets actually creates more aggression from the side of the ministry or the or the security sector because it sends a message to the presidency and the rest of the institution that we are fighting for. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2321.0s)]
*  So one we are going to continue to do this and two you are not to prosecute any of our people because of cases of torture or anything that we have been surfacing that we've seen either through social media or through the remaining few organizations. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2340.0s)]
*  That are trying to document torture or forced disappearances and all the other human rights violations and because of that it goes in a mutual dynamic between judges haven't seen any real incriminating for an actual verdict. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2360.0s)]
*  And I think any of the officers have been involved in torture and we like with clear cases with proof. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2376.0s)]
*  So so this dynamics and we like it goes like a vicious vicious circle in a way that is very dangerous because it would only take a small trigger that things would be able to go on. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2385.0s)]
*  And so we engage be it in parliament or outside the parliament. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2424.0s)]
*  The same cannot be said about Morocco. So Morocco has a democratically elected parliament. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2429.0s)]
*  Morocco has a plurality of actors parties represented in parliament. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2435.0s)]
*  Morocco has as you were saying for the second term we have a democratically made the government coming out parliament and out of relatively fair and transparent elections. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2439.0s)]
*  However looking at the protests in the reef I was I found it very striking at first of all the discourse coming from the monarchy as well as from the government from the leading from from the party for justice and development. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2454.0s)]
*  Was a discourse dismissive of people's needs economic needs of people's. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2467.0s)]
*  Complaints with regard to their entitlements as citizens with regard to lacking equal citizenship rights. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2475.0s)]
*  I found it surprising that not only the monarchy but the democratically elected government responded to what seemed to me like legitimate concerns of citizens. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2482.0s)]
*  In a highly authoritarian manner not very different not as violent not as aggressive as you would get elsewhere in neighboring Algeria maybe in not that close Egypt or elsewhere but in essence quite as authoritarian as dismissive of citizens. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2490.0s)]
*  So where does it come from. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2505.0s)]
*  Morocco is a place with stable politics with if not vibrant but the stable civil society sphere that has not been shrinking in recent years unlike Egypt unlike places like Yemen where civil society is basically in collapse due to the civil war in a way in collapse in a way reviving. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2507.0s)]
*  I get back to the pattern. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2519.0s)]
*  So how can we explain that. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2521.0s)]
*  I think it goes back to this history with the reef region one of the first actually the first official government statement that was released in response to the protests was to dismiss them and characterize them as separatists and this was due to the fact that in a number of protests they would actually wave the [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2522.0s)]
*  the reef republic flag to the very distinct flag from you know the very distinct flag from the very distinct flag of the country. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2527.0s)]
*  So that's where it comes from. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2533.0s)]
*  So I think it goes back to the history of the reef region. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2535.0s)]

*  of the National Rally of Independence, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2802.76s)]
*  which was a party founded by an extended member [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2804.48s)]
*  of the royal family, or by technocrats. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2806.76s)]
*  So I think that sort of represents and demonstrates [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2809.72s)]
*  how this sort of doesn't stand, yeah. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2813.08s)]
*  Thank you, Samia. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2815.7599999999998s)]
*  Let me come to you before opening up, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2816.6s)]
*  I'm starting our Q&A session. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2822.0s)]
*  So Samia was just saying, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2823.8799999999997s)]
*  well, you can have the best constitution on paper, [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2825.9599999999996s)]
*  have a parliament endowed with legislative [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2829.9199999999996s)]
*  and oversight competencies, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2833.48s)]
*  but the reality of politics sometimes take you [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2835.3999999999996s)]
*  somewhere else. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2839.9599999999996s)]
*  So now in Yemen, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2841.2s)]
*  for the war, before the current situation started to unfold, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2845.6s)]
*  Yemen was a place with a plurality of political parties. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2851.6s)]
*  In fact, a plurality of political parties [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2854.9599999999996s)]
*  representing various shades ideologically, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2857.3199999999997s)]
*  Islamist and non-Islamist, leftist, right-wing parties, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2860.9599999999996s)]
*  some were tribal-based, some were less tribal-based, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2864.8399999999997s)]
*  a bit of tribal-based exists everywhere. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2867.52s)]
*  But this was a place with plurality of, [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2870.24s)]
*  with some pluralism in politics and political sphere. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2873.7599999999998s)]
*  This was a place with a very vibrant civil society [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2877.04s)]
*  prior to 2011. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2879.44s)]
*  So the untold story of Yemen since the unification [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2881.44s)]
*  of the two Yamans in the 1990s has been the rise [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2884.44s)]
*  of independent autonomous civil society actors. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2887.72s)]
*  So an extent we in Egypt were quite envious [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2890.96s)]
*  of what was happening in Yemen as we were envious [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2893.72s)]
*  of places like Baghdan, Jordan, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2896.68s)]
*  and Baghdan, Morocco in the 1990s. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2900.04s)]
*  So what is happening to civil society in Yemen? [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2902.6s)]
*  How are civil society actors managing the current situation? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2906.6s)]
*  And where are political parties? [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2910.6s)]
*  I mean, we hardly hear about anyone apart from Al-Housey, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2911.7599999999998s)]
*  apart from the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2915.2s)]
*  and his group, and of course the Saudi-supported, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2917.64s)]
*  promoted, funded coalition ruling out of Edmund. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2921.3999999999996s)]
*  So if we can move beyond them, beyond key actors [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2925.52s)]
*  in the current war on Yemen, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2928.7599999999998s)]
*  where is civil society and where are political actors? [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2932.0s)]
*  Yeah, we had the first parliamentary election [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2934.96s)]
*  in the Arabian Peninsula in 1993, actually, you're right. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2939.36s)]
*  Before that, the south of Yemen was so socialist [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2943.0s)]
*  to the point at one point the head of the state was fired [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2945.48s)]
*  because he married a second wife. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2948.52s)]
*  And that was that much of a strike. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2950.48s)]
*  And we had quite a tremendous experience [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2952.96s)]
*  of political parties, of populism, [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2956.56s)]
*  throughout the last 50 years. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2959.08s)]
*  Yemen is a very dynamic country, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2962.32s)]
*  and that's why I think we get exhausted right now [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2964.16s)]
*  following the news about it, but it's a dynamic country. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2966.44s)]
*  For the last 50 years, we have seen monarchy, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2971.28s)]
*  we have seen Marxism in the South Republic, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2973.76s)]
*  we have seen the wave of parliament, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2977.2000000000003s)]
*  we joined the wave of the Arab Spring. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2978.76s)]
*  It is an exhausting country from a historical point of view, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2980.92s)]
*  in a good way, it moves very quickly, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2984.28s)]
*  it responds to the international development [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2986.6800000000003s)]
*  around the world, despite the relatively stable neighborhood [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2989.64s)]
*  around it, which doesn't respond into any, [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2992.92s)]
*  except in wars. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2996.2000000000003s)]
*  So that's something, it is a unique, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=2997.52s)]
*  but it has to do with the fact [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3000.04s)]
*  that there is a political culture. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3001.4s)]
*  There is an experience for thousands of years, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3003.28s)]
*  for hundreds of years, and there is a difference [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3006.48s)]
*  between the political and the historical Yemen. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3009.32s)]
*  The political Yemen can change overnight, [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3011.6400000000003s)]
*  and it goes all the way right, left, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3013.6000000000004s)]
*  but the historical Yemen is a stable, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3015.48s)]
*  and that there is a country there, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3017.4s)]
*  there is a place called Yemen, and it's very dynamic, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3018.56s)]
*  and it's a terrible maker, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3020.84s)]
*  in the positive meaning of the word, for politics. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3022.96s)]
*  The problem for the last two years, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3028.48s)]
*  and this is why this war is like, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3029.88s)]
*  is not like anything we have ever seen in Yemen. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3033.0s)]
*  We have had conflicts, we have always had violence, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3035.44s)]
*  but not never in this massive, never this, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3038.0s)]
*  you have 12 countries at least right now, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3040.36s)]
*  and you have almost everyone in the ground [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3042.4s)]
*  fighting everyone, and too many countries from outside. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3044.2s)]
*  What did that do, and I think that's mostly [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3047.84s)]
*  because of 2216 UN Security Council Resolution, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3050.48s)]
*  which basically brought a lot of legal justification [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3054.44s)]
*  to this war, is it banned politics. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3057.04s)]
*  There is no politics, basically, for the last three years. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3060.32s)]
*  There is no politics, there is a fight, there is a war. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3062.72s)]
*  At any side, you speak to the Houthis, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3065.76s)]
*  the very little ones who used to think among the STEM [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3068.52s)]
*  are sidelined right now. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3071.96s)]
*  The other side also only do in the military, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3074.44s)]
*  or only do for fighters, and that's what war does anyway. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3076.52s)]
*  Now I wouldn't call it, [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3081.92s)]
*  depending on which side you take, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3085.0s)]
*  if you are on the Saudi side, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3088.92s)]
*  you would say the war started in September 21st, 2014, [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3090.52s)]
*  when the Houthis took over, [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3095.6s)]
*  if you are on the Houthi side, [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3098.44s)]
*  you would say the war started actually in March 25th, 2015, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3099.28s)]
*  but if you are someone with a centimeter of a brain, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3104.52s)]
*  I think you will go back to 2011, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3106.68s)]
*  you will go back to the consequence, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3109.56s)]
*  faulty political process that ultimately led to this war. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3111.4s)]
*  It didn't happen without the context. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3115.28s)]
*  The Houthis then suddenly marched to Sana'a [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3117.48s)]
*  and took it over, they were taking battles since 2011. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3119.28s)]
*  There was a process, because it was a fraud process, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3122.68s)]
*  because it was a deceptive process, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3125.24s)]
*  and because it was a process that had to look okay, [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3126.92s)]
*  that doesn't have to be okay, it had to look okay, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3130.1200000000003s)]
*  and it looked okay actually, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3133.4s)]
*  and ultimately that led into the absence of, [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3135.28s)]
*  or the destruction of politics basically, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3138.96s)]
*  and taking the country into a war from an external [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3141.56s)]
*  and from an internal point of view. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3145.1200000000003s)]
*  Very marginalized right now, the civil society, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3147.6400000000003s)]
*  because I mean, for example, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3150.44s)]
*  if you're a civil society right now in Sana'a, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3151.44s)]
*  you cannot do anything, or even an event, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3153.92s)]
*  until you get the permission from the Houthi section [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3157.7200000000003s)]
*  10 days ago from the Houthi police. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3160.1600000000003s)]
*  10 days ago, you have to report where you are doing, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3162.1600000000003s)]
*  who you are bringing, who gave you this money, [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3164.6400000000003s)]
*  and even hand them out the agenda 10 days ago, [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3166.8s)]
*  in the 10 days ahead. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3169.36s)]
*  There is no, they don't joke about that. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3170.36s)]
*  There is no space for civil society. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3172.96s)]
*  There is, I was in Sana'a last month, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3175.32s)]
*  and there is zero newspaper that was, [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3178.04s)]
*  that's not the Houthi newspaper, zero. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3181.0s)]
*  We had more than 22, or one point, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3183.52s)]
*  of newspapers around the country. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3185.44s)]
*  We had, and this is why I say Yemen is dynamic. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3187.0s)]
*  We have 50% almost of illiteracy in Yemen, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3189.44s)]
*  but we had four English newspapers a week, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3192.6s)]
*  more than Lebanon had, actually. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3195.32s)]
*  But all of this is basically shut off right now, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3198.6s)]
*  whether from this side or that side. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3200.68s)]
*  And I think that's, out of everything this war is doing, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3202.7200000000003s)]
*  the most, that's the most dangerous thing. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3206.28s)]
*  It's illegalizing politics. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3208.7200000000003s)]
*  In a country that was run by politics, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3210.92s)]
*  even when there was some sort of authoritarian, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3212.96s)]
*  there was politics. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3215.84s)]
*  That was something that Yemenis were used to [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3217.0s)]
*  and practiced contrary to Libyans, contrary to Syria, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3219.56s)]
*  contrary to many other regional. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3222.88s)]
*  There was a political experience in a country like Yemen. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3224.7200000000003s)]
*  Very much fair. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3229.32s)]
*  Thank you all. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3230.1600000000003s)]
*  We're coming now to you. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3232.96s)]
*  We have half an hour for what's hopefully going to be [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3234.7200000000003s)]
*  a vibrant Q&A session. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3239.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm afraid the narrative, to use Nancy's terminology, [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3240.68s)]
*  the panel shared with us is not a pleasant one, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3245.2799999999997s)]
*  but it's an interesting narrative, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3248.52s)]
*  and it's gloomy in nature because it has a great deal [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3250.4s)]
*  of details and differences and similarities [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3252.96s)]
*  between three quite distinct countries, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3255.56s)]
*  each one in itself, but yet some interesting reflections [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3259.3199999999997s)]
*  which came out of the panel with regard to [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3264.2s)]
*  how vibrant formal politics and political dynamics can be, [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3266.48s)]
*  what are their impacts when they are not as vibrant, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3270.92s)]
*  what happens when you extinct civil society [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3272.8s)]
*  and close off, shut off spaces for freedom of expression [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3275.0s)]
*  and their impacts on security and governance [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3279.44s)]
*  in these three countries. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3282.4s)]
*  So let's open it up, and I'm taking it to Saar. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3283.4s)]
*  We'll collect questions to give you more time [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3285.88s)]
*  to share your ideas, so we start with Saar. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3288.8s)]
*  We'll take rounds of three questions each. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3291.6400000000003s)]
*  Thank you guys. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3294.88s)]
*  My question is specific to Samia, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3295.7200000000003s)]
*  but I'd love to hear other's thoughts on this. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3297.5600000000004s)]
*  Samia, you bring up a really important point, [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3299.8s)]
*  which is the question of accountability, [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3302.4s)]
*  which goes not only to the heart of governance, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3304.6800000000003s)]
*  but it also goes to power dynamic in Morocco [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3306.6400000000003s)]
*  between the different players. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3311.44s)]
*  So you have the palace, which controls politics completely, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3313.0800000000004s)]
*  but somehow manages to stay above it, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3317.4s)]
*  but in terms of governance, it controls that as well, [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3320.1200000000003s)]
*  but devolves just enough responsibility to the government [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3322.92s)]
*  so that they can blame them should anything go wrong. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3326.56s)]
*  And in my mind, I can only think of two examples [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3329.84s)]
*  where the monarchy has been held accountable [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3332.68s)]
*  in one way or another. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3337.2s)]
*  The reef protests that you bring up, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3338.2799999999997s)]
*  and I can't remember if it was 2013 or 2014 [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3340.2799999999997s)]
*  when the Spanish pedophile was pardoned. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3343.64s)]
*  Do you see this as sort of a bigger shift [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3348.52s)]
*  where there is more willingness to really hold [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3351.2799999999997s)]
*  the real power brokers responsible, [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3354.24s)]
*  or do you see these as just sort of [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3358.24s)]
*  momentary things that happen that may not amount to much? [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3360.4399999999996s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3364.4399999999996s)]
*  I'll be moving between left and right, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3369.2799999999997s)]
*  front rows and back rows, so bear with me. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3372.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3378.04s)]
*  Howard University. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3379.52s)]
*  I'm kind of struck by the two cases, Egypt and Yemen. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3381.72s)]
*  Our cases, of course, were the Arab uprisings took place [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3386.9199999999996s)]
*  and were somewhat successful. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3392.12s)]
*  They certainly forced those who had been in power [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3395.04s)]
*  for a very long time to step down, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3399.2799999999997s)]
*  and yet, obviously, they have not been as successful [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3401.48s)]
*  in negotiating a transition to a system [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3405.8399999999997s)]
*  that would take the demands of bread, liberty, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3410.2s)]
*  social justice, and dignity into effect. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3413.3199999999997s)]
*  And it seems like what happened was, as a result, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3415.52s)]
*  is basically the use of security. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3420.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm sorry, that's me. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3424.4399999999996s)]
*  I was just going to say. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3427.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3435.7999999999997s)]
*  So security seems to have replaced politics, [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3436.64s)]
*  and this is perhaps the marker of the outcome, [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3441.6s)]
*  of this particular, of the outcome, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3446.8799999999997s)]
*  the political outcome that occurred in both Egypt [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3449.6s)]
*  and in Yemen. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3452.44s)]
*  If that is the case, what kind of a political bargain [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3456.3199999999997s)]
*  is behind this? [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3461.56s)]
*  If it replaced politics, if security has replaced politics, [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3463.56s)]
*  then there must be a political bargain [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3468.84s)]
*  that has been struck by those who are in power [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3472.0s)]
*  and some groups in those societies. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3475.7599999999998s)]
*  And so, I mean, we need to be thinking about that [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3479.7599999999998s)]
*  in trying to figure out who benefits, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3483.2s)]
*  who are the losers in this. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3487.72s)]
*  Okay, so I'm seeing Perry. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3490.44s)]
*  Hi, Perry Kamak with Carnegie. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3496.36s)]
*  Thanks for three good presentations. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3497.88s)]
*  My question is for Farah. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3499.76s)]
*  You kind of talked about this interesting juxtaposition [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3501.6800000000003s)]
*  of a country which has kind of a lot of fragility [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3505.1600000000003s)]
*  in its politics and political institutions [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3508.6800000000003s)]
*  kind of superimposed on this continuity [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3511.6400000000003s)]
*  of social and cultural institutions. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3514.04s)]
*  And I'm kind of struck that the tragedy, really, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3516.92s)]
*  of the Yemeni Civil War now [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3521.04s)]
*  is that the international intervention [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3522.4399999999996s)]
*  has kind of blocked these deeper cultural [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3524.68s)]
*  social institutions from their normal [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3527.8799999999997s)]
*  kind of conflict resolution mode. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3530.4399999999996s)]
*  And I'm just wondering if this is a kind of transient moment, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3533.12s)]
*  if there were a way to kind of deescalate [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3536.56s)]
*  both from the Arabian Peninsula, from Iran, [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3539.24s)]
*  kind of make this a local conflict [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3541.7599999999998s)]
*  rather than an international one, [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3544.2799999999997s)]
*  can these indigenous conflict resolutions [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3546.64s)]
*  be kind of resuscitated or is the damage permanent? [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3550.8799999999997s)]
*  And really the related question is what then does it take, [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3553.96s)]
*  would it take to kind of end sustainably the conflict there? [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3556.64s)]
*  Okay, let's take one more question [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3562.24s)]
*  before coming back to our panel. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3563.8399999999997s)]
*  Please go ahead. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3566.08s)]
*  So here in the front. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3566.92s)]
*  Thank you, Mike Koetzig. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3572.4s)]
*  Nancy, I see in your title, Tahrir Institute. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3574.88s)]
*  Tahrir is a very special place, Tahrir Square. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3579.36s)]
*  What happened to that? [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3583.48s)]
*  What happened to the people who were there? [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3584.56s)]
*  What are they saying? [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3586.36s)]
*  What are they doing? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3587.32s)]
*  Is there a difference now between Mubarak and Sisi? [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3588.6400000000003s)]
*  Because we read in the headline, [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3592.48s)]
*  Sisi is as bad, if not worse, than Mubarak. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3593.56s)]
*  What's going on there? [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3596.2400000000002s)]
*  And could you tell, give us a little bit of the impact [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3597.48s)]
*  of the fact that the United States [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3600.32s)]
*  is withholding aid at the moment? [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3601.56s)]
*  And what does the military say about that? [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3603.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3605.76s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3606.6000000000004s)]
*  So let's come back. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3607.44s)]
*  Would you mind saying your name again? [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3610.6400000000003s)]
*  So let's come back to the panel. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3614.2400000000002s)]
*  I'd like to have at least two more rounds of questions. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3617.76s)]
*  I have so many hands. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3620.36s)]
*  So let's try to be brief [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3621.7200000000003s)]
*  and let's go in a reverse order to Farah [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3622.92s)]
*  followed by Samia, followed by Nancy. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3625.7200000000003s)]
*  And if each one of you can maybe take two to three minutes. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3628.4s)]
*  Yeah, I'll take this because I don't know the answers [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3631.68s)]
*  much less than that. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3635.0s)]
*  Yes, I think it's a very- [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3637.56s)]
*  So time is up. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3638.72s)]
*  But no, you have to kind of. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3641.56s)]
*  I'll say, I mean. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3642.7599999999998s)]
*  The tribal way, so. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3645.6s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3649.16s)]
*  No, I think, yes, I think it's very important [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3650.3599999999997s)]
*  to dig out who's behind this [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3653.24s)]
*  and who's benefiting from what. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3655.16s)]
*  And I really think that's something we lack as scholars [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3656.7599999999998s)]
*  or as people who are looking for ideas. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3660.0s)]
*  This is especially important because public opinion [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3662.52s)]
*  we have in our part of the world is built on rumors, [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3665.1600000000003s)]
*  not in information. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3668.04s)]
*  And there are some interests that remain there [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3669.6800000000003s)]
*  that are benefiting from the war and that will benefit. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3672.08s)]
*  And we are unable to see who's behind it. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3674.76s)]
*  Very specific example of behind the security order, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3676.7200000000003s)]
*  for example. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3679.6400000000003s)]
*  In 2013, we had a very famous research, [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3681.28s)]
*  Charon House, that showed that we had 10 families in Yemen [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3684.92s)]
*  that controlled 86% of the imports, exports, banking, [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3688.72s)]
*  communication, and basically the top 10 source of wealth [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3693.8399999999997s)]
*  in the country by 10 families. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3697.2s)]
*  These families, for example, are still players [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3699.4399999999996s)]
*  even today in Yemen. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3701.56s)]
*  And nothing had changed with them after 2011. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3702.7999999999997s)]
*  They were players and they remain players. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3705.7999999999997s)]
*  And this is something now one is really digging [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3707.52s)]
*  on who's behind that and I share your concern. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3709.8799999999997s)]
*  When it comes to the, can there be a local process? [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3713.64s)]
*  Yes, if this was left to Yemenis, we can solve this war. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3717.56s)]
*  We have an excellent historical experience in dealing [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3720.68s)]
*  with conflicts and with conflict resolution. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3723.68s)]
*  It is, but the problem is this is, yes, it is a war [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3726.52s)]
*  about Yemen or it started about Yemen, [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3729.4s)]
*  but it's no more in the hand of Yemen [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3732.0s)]
*  and it no more has to do with Yemen. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3734.16s)]
*  Very specific example I was referring to last night [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3736.24s)]
*  is in Yemen, we have the tribes at one point, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3738.84s)]
*  for example, last year, they had a gathering for two hours [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3742.12s)]
*  and they freed 800 prisoners. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3745.92s)]
*  The UN envoy went to Yemen and he had a chapter seven [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3747.96s)]
*  behind them and he freed four prisoners. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3750.8s)]
*  So that's these local domestic conflict resolution models [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3752.88s)]
*  are highly under looked and highly can be brought. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3756.12s)]
*  Right now they're being used for war reasons. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3758.52s)]
*  You get the tribes to fight, you get them to do this, [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3761.0s)]
*  but no one has used that from a conflict resolution [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3763.28s)]
*  point of view and I think can be very, very important [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3766.2400000000002s)]
*  to free the freaks of war. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3768.6s)]
*  Very much, Samia? [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3771.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, on the question of accountability, I mean, [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3772.4s)]
*  what's so interesting is, and this is a trend for years, [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3774.4s)]
*  for example, you go to a protest in a remote village, [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3777.36s)]
*  for example, and people are protesting [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3780.28s)]
*  because their land is being stolen or very local reason [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3782.12s)]
*  and they're carrying pictures of the king, [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3787.12s)]
*  appealing to the king. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3789.0s)]
*  So I think there's sort of, there has always been [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3790.4s)]
*  that appealing to the power of the monarchy [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3793.4s)]
*  because people know that that's where the power lies. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3796.0s)]
*  In terms of accountability, I still don't even think [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3799.32s)]
*  we're there yet because if we do start considering [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3801.96s)]
*  the accountability that the palace should be held for, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3805.76s)]
*  then that would open up a huge Pandora's box. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3808.76s)]
*  I mean, just look at the role of the king [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3811.52s)]
*  in the private sector, for example. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3813.68s)]
*  I mean, essentially every single sector, [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3815.6s)]
*  the royal holding firm has a portion of control over, [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3819.56s)]
*  including monopolies on sugar, for example, [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3825.2s)]
*  which is something that is subsidies [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3827.6s)]
*  that are controlled by the government. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3829.6s)]
*  So in terms of accountability, [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3830.76s)]
*  I don't think that we're there yet, [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3832.6800000000003s)]
*  but I think it's sort of relevant to point out [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3834.0400000000004s)]
*  in this context how the regionalization plan [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3837.36s)]
*  was intended to divert power and the centralization [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3839.92s)]
*  of Rabat away to these 12 regions in Morocco, right? [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3842.88s)]
*  But the way it unfolded was kind of counterproductive [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3846.4s)]
*  and in fact just further bolstered the inefficiency [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3849.7200000000003s)]
*  and the bloated nature of the public administration, [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3852.6800000000003s)]
*  public sector, because you have 12 regions [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3854.84s)]
*  that are governed by 12 different, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3857.2000000000003s)]
*  Ouelis are governors that are appointed by the king [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3859.6s)]
*  and then 12 different presidents [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3862.28s)]
*  that are elected from local elections. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3863.76s)]
*  So you have Oueli and a president [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3866.2400000000002s)]
*  and who is held responsible for what. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3868.64s)]
*  And not to mention that this trickles down [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3871.28s)]
*  to the basic public administrative task. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3873.52s)]
*  I mean, just to get a residency certificate [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3878.36s)]
*  or a marriage license, I mean, [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3880.4s)]
*  what processes you have to go through [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3882.2000000000003s)]
*  that sort of all go back to this dual executive nature [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3884.56s)]
*  and the fact that, yeah, just to reiterate, [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3889.2s)]
*  I don't think that we're at a point of accountability [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3891.7999999999997s)]
*  for the palace just yet, but I think people [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3894.68s)]
*  have not shied away from being very explicit [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3897.9199999999996s)]
*  and openly acknowledging that they know [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3900.72s)]
*  that the palace is the one that wields power [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3902.24s)]
*  in the country and not the government. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3903.7599999999998s)]
*  And to start, Mervet and Michael in 15 seconds. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3909.72s)]
*  No, it wasn't successful. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3913.6s)]
*  I wouldn't consider Egypt as a success story. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3915.12s)]
*  And Sisi is worse than the park. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3920.04s)]
*  But just to elaborate on this, [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3922.2799999999997s)]
*  things are not that simplistic, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3927.3199999999997s)]
*  but when you see, I mean, when people took to the streets, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3928.8399999999997s)]
*  as Mervet was saying, they were hoping for freedom, [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3933.4399999999996s)]
*  bread and justice, and none of this has been achieved. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3937.08s)]
*  And in terms of accountability, [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3942.3999999999996s)]
*  it goes across board on all levels of people [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3945.32s)]
*  in the government and official. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3949.0400000000004s)]
*  No one was held accountable for anything, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3950.84s)]
*  starting by Mubarak himself or just yesterday, [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3953.2000000000003s)]
*  pictures of him having his summer vacation [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3956.7200000000003s)]
*  in the Northern Coast with his granddaughter and his son, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3960.28s)]
*  which is very provocative. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3963.96s)]
*  And actually, as things are even worse right now, [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3965.6000000000004s)]
*  instead of people just frowning upon things like that, [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3968.4s)]
*  people are reminiscing of the good old days of Mubarak [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3971.2400000000002s)]
*  when people are not like forcibly disappeared [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3973.96s)]
*  or tortured to death by that in love of numbers. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3976.28s)]
*  Was he good? [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3980.04s)]
*  No, it just, what we're seeing right now [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3980.88s)]
*  is a continuation of a corrupt system [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3985.04s)]
*  with lack of accountability. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3988.56s)]
*  There are no structural changes that happen in the country. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3990.6s)]
*  Going back to the question that, [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3995.2400000000002s)]
*  or the statement that Mervet made, [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3997.36s)]
*  it was like, was there a bargain there for security? [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=3999.92s)]
*  Again, there is a very critical issue [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4003.92s)]
*  when we talk about security and how the West view it [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4008.36s)]
*  and how people inside these countries are viewing it. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4011.44s)]
*  Security, well, first of all, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4015.36s)]
*  the quest for freedom and democracy [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4017.08s)]
*  transformed over time just lowering the bar [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4020.6400000000003s)]
*  just to have some stability and have some, [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4023.4s)]
*  I mean, sort of decreasing the amount of terror attacks. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4026.76s)]
*  So it turned from democracy to security to terrorism. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4032.2000000000003s)]
*  But even when we talk about terrorism, [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4035.96s)]
*  and that's the biggest problem of the West [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4037.92s)]
*  and that talks a little bit about the point of cutting aid [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4040.0s)]
*  and what the West views, when we talk about terrorism, [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4043.32s)]
*  everyone is, instead of looking at security, [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4046.92s)]
*  is looking at containment. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4049.5600000000004s)]
*  That violence is tolerated [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4051.1600000000003s)]
*  as long as it's contained within the border. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4052.7200000000003s)]
*  If it spills out outside of this region, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4055.8s)]
*  it becomes a bigger problem and people pay attention. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4060.48s)]
*  But as long as it is contained, [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4063.36s)]
*  even terrorism is tolerated. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4067.6s)]
*  And that's hugely problematic [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4069.76s)]
*  because this is not a sustainable situation. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4071.44s)]
*  And sooner or later, they spill up and get out of hand. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4074.64s)]
*  But what the West is dealing with the region, [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4078.68s)]
*  whether we're talking about Syria, [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4082.28s)]
*  whether we're talking about Yemen, [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4083.64s)]
*  and particularly when we're talking about Egypt, [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4084.7200000000003s)]
*  because they see it as a better example [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4086.64s)]
*  in the rest of the country, [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4089.24s)]
*  I mean, with the exception of Tunisia, [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4091.4799999999996s)]
*  that things are contained, then it's fine. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4094.56s)]
*  But they're not. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4098.2s)]
*  Because actually going back to the comparison [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4099.5199999999995s)]
*  between Mubarak and Sisi, [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4102.92s)]
*  it's the same structural challenges that we have been seeing, [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4104.76s)]
*  failure of the institute. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4109.24s)]
*  The only difference between, I would say, [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4110.599999999999s)]
*  there are a few differences. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4113.0s)]
*  Of course, the level of repression is unprecedented. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4115.24s)]
*  We haven't seen that level of torture, [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4117.88s)]
*  forced disappearances. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4121.4800000000005s)]
*  So ask, where are the people who were in Tahir? [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4123.4400000000005s)]
*  Case in point, they are in exile. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4125.84s)]
*  Or they are in jail. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4128.16s)]
*  Or there are ones who are not in jail [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4130.0s)]
*  and are not in exile, but they are banned from traveling. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4132.72s)]
*  Their assets are free. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4135.4800000000005s)]
*  So basically, instead of the government have learned [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4136.88s)]
*  even from their mistakes, coming more strict, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4139.68s)]
*  they're not putting people in jail [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4142.56s)]
*  and they're not closing down organizations. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4144.2s)]
*  But they're freezing their assets. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4146.56s)]
*  So they cannot travel, they cannot do their work, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4147.92s)]
*  and they're just living there [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4150.72s)]
*  just like in confinement, basically. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4152.0s)]
*  So they're completely killing and crippling. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4155.6s)]
*  And at the same time, there are no, [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4161.64s)]
*  first of all, the documentation. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4164.160000000001s)]
*  First of all, a pre-step for accountability [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4166.04s)]
*  that Ndesar is asking about is the documents. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4170.320000000001s)]
*  Before you go into accountability. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4173.72s)]
*  And the government is ahead of the game on this. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4175.76s)]
*  It's just like crippling any attempts to organize. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4178.2s)]
*  And you cannot take this to the next level [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4181.400000000001s)]
*  of any judicial process or anything. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4183.320000000001s)]
*  So bottom line, there's no accountability. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4187.360000000001s)]
*  And the West is only concerned with accountability. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4190.56s)]
*  This morning, we've seen the Senate House, [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4194.280000000001s)]
*  the upper creation committee, [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4199.08s)]
*  and we're seeing that they need to be caught [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4200.8s)]
*  for one billion, to one billion, [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4204.12s)]
*  and raising the human rights condition to 25%. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4206.599999999999s)]
*  This is good, okay? [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4209.28s)]
*  But the problem with the US policy towards Egypt, [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4211.12s)]
*  first of all, it has an inflated sense of control [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4214.5199999999995s)]
*  of what's going on inside the country. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4218.08s)]
*  And second, there is a complete lack of coherence. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4220.16s)]
*  So they would make just one gesture like that, [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4222.8s)]
*  but there is no follow-up, [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4225.24s)]
*  and there is a slight packing on the back [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4226.5599999999995s)]
*  on the other issues that are going on within the country. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4228.5599999999995s)]
*  So basically, the government feels that they have [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4231.84s)]
*  carte blanche to do whatever they want to do, [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4236.72s)]
*  and there are no consequences for what happens. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4240.4800000000005s)]
*  So let's open up for your questions again. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4244.64s)]
*  I'm going to start with the last four rows, [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4247.76s)]
*  then the middle four rows, and the first two rows. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4251.24s)]
*  Just to get more of a representative sample. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4253.56s)]
*  Any questions in the last four rows? [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4255.76s)]
*  Yes, please, go ahead. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4257.64s)]
*  And would you mind introducing yourself to everyone? [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4259.280000000001s)]
*  Badr al-Bandari from Maxwell School. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4262.8s)]
*  So my question is to Nancy. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4265.6s)]
*  I want to go back to the terrorist groups in Egypt, [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4267.8s)]
*  actually, especially, we cannot say they're only in Sinai. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4271.08s)]
*  They're all over Egypt. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4275.2s)]
*  So as you mentioned, there are like, [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4277.04s)]
*  Waleid Sina, there is like, Lewa Soura, there's Hassam, [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4280.4800000000005s)]
*  and there's also, you mentioned that interview [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4285.8s)]
*  about the Islamic State representative there. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4287.72s)]
*  So you think this diversity of those movements [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4290.56s)]
*  or those groups, does it indicate to that propaganda [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4296.68s)]
*  that they want to make that they are a lot, [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4302.240000000001s)]
*  and they want to increase their position [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4304.8s)]
*  against an increasing the sense of instability? [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4308.280000000001s)]
*  Or it's a matter of, there is a real division [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4314.16s)]
*  among them, they are all sharing the same ideology, [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4317.64s)]
*  the Islamic ideology, but is it really different [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4321.320000000001s)]
*  from all of them? [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4326.240000000001s)]
*  Does this indicate to a real difference [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4327.64s)]
*  between their ideology? [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4330.360000000001s)]
*  And does that mean, does that indicate [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4332.200000000001s)]
*  to a complete chaotic scene in case of a complete failure [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4335.320000000001s)]
*  of the state? [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4341.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4343.96s)]
*  Thank you, Badr. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4345.120000000001s)]
*  Please go ahead. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4346.24s)]
*  Three quick sort of questions that are all the same idea, [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4350.84s)]
*  one for each of you. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4353.92s)]
*  What do the people who are creating the security problem [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4355.4800000000005s)]
*  in Egypt want? [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4359.16s)]
*  Do they, what do they want? [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4360.72s)]
*  And the same question for Morocco, which is, [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4363.08s)]
*  okay, all the people in the SEMA are making all this fuss. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4367.2s)]
*  What do they want? [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4370.88s)]
*  Can they point to a region and say, [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4372.36s)]
*  treat us like that region? [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4374.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4377.72s)]
*  And finally, for Yemen, I'm gonna challenge you [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4378.68s)]
*  on the notion of a Yemen. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4382.92s)]
*  And there's, what is it they're looking for? [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4386.12s)]
*  What's the Yemen that these traditional forces [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4391.200000000001s)]
*  could coalesce to create? [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4394.92s)]
*  What is that Yemen? [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4396.92s)]
*  Because right now they've coalesced to create [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4398.16s)]
*  a series of smaller Yemens that seem to respond [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4400.4800000000005s)]
*  to what they want. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4404.44s)]
*  So what's the geographic political entity [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4405.599999999999s)]
*  that they could and should coalesce to create? [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4409.639999999999s)]
*  Because there's a lot of options historically. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4414.32s)]
*  And then the final overall question is, [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4417.5199999999995s)]
*  how much of this is driven by bored young men? [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4419.28s)]
*  Any of the countries? [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4422.58s)]
*  Thank you, bored young men. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4424.16s)]
*  So right here. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4426.759999999999s)]
*  So we'll take, if you agree, we'll take two or three [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4428.16s)]
*  more questions, and this is the last round, [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4434.88s)]
*  and then come back to you. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4437.0s)]
*  Please. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4439.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4439.96s)]
*  Fouad Shah with the National Center for State Courts. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4440.8s)]
*  Two questions, first one, Egypt and then Yemen. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4443.08s)]
*  Yeah, Egypt, a couple years back under the Sisi regime, [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4445.84s)]
*  they passed anti-terrorism legislation [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4450.28s)]
*  focusing on behalf of state security. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4453.92s)]
*  These laws have been broadly translated, [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4461.4400000000005s)]
*  interpreted to the point where, if you look, [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4463.96s)]
*  people across society have been arrested, detained. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4467.92s)]
*  People are in pretrial for months, if not years, [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4471.08s)]
*  without seeing a judge. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4473.96s)]
*  Once in court, their case goes through within minutes, [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4475.96s)]
*  half an hour if they're lucky. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4479.96s)]
*  And this is happening time and time again. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4481.32s)]
*  People are being targeted, students, youth, elderly. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4482.96s)]
*  Someone says something in the wrong place [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4486.84s)]
*  in a metro stop, they're being arrested. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4488.4s)]
*  The son says something on Facebook. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4491.08s)]
*  He's being detained by state security. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4493.52s)]
*  And again, these cases are being tracked, [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4496.08s)]
*  and the question is, does the government not see [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4498.36s)]
*  what they're doing is creating breeding grounds [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4502.52s)]
*  just as what happened in Iraq, [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4505.0s)]
*  when all these people and populations were being arrested [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4506.6s)]
*  through blanket, you know, blanket arrest, blanket policies. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4510.4s)]
*  For Yemen, Yemeni-born, Arab-American, [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4514.799999999999s)]
*  and seeing all that's been happening, [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4518.12s)]
*  you listed a long list of crises in Yemen, [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4520.24s)]
*  the civil war, the grievances of decades, [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4523.48s)]
*  cholera outbreak, refugee, humanitarian situation. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4526.5199999999995s)]
*  The list goes on and on. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4530.36s)]
*  How do we step back? [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4532.679999999999s)]
*  How do we say, where are we going with this? [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4534.48s)]
*  Yemeni people are resilient, [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4538.0s)]
*  they're able to conduct very good understanding of any conflict, [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4539.5199999999995s)]
*  as you said, historically, but it's... [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4543.719999999999s)]
*  I think the Pandora box has been opened, [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4546.719999999999s)]
*  and we are having a hard time closing it back, [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4548.4s)]
*  and we don't know where to start or where to end it, [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4550.639999999999s)]
*  and it just seems like a black hole right now. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4552.839999999999s)]
*  Anyone? To your right, please. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4555.919999999999s)]
*  Mine's quick. To Samia. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4559.16s)]
*  In addition to what the demands of the protesters are, [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4561.919999999999s)]
*  I'd like to just sort of widen that question a little bit. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4565.04s)]
*  This panel was about security and governance, [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4567.88s)]
*  so you didn't go that much into the economics of it all, [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4570.64s)]
*  but this was an informal sector actor. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4573.16s)]
*  There are a number of economic responses by the government, [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4576.08s)]
*  perhaps better than the political ones. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4578.32s)]
*  There are all these, you know, the mega projects. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4579.84s)]
*  You touched on all this, but I was wondering [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4582.04s)]
*  if you could sort of widen the lens a little bit, [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4583.6s)]
*  talk about the reef economy in that context, [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4585.12s)]
*  what the correct solution is. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4589.12s)]
*  If it isn't mega projects, you know... [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4590.56s)]
*  Okay. Any more questions? Last question. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4592.48s)]
*  Yeah. So, just a background. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4600.48s)]
*  I mean, a bit of anecdotal evidence here, [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4602.719999999999s)]
*  but I spent two years in Egypt, [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4605.5199999999995s)]
*  and I remember kind of prior to the Arab Spring, [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4606.919999999999s)]
*  everyone being really, really surprised when Egypt fell, [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4610.04s)]
*  because they thought that Mubarak's hold was so strong, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4612.959999999999s)]
*  and when Egypt fell, it was everyone just thought, [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4615.799999999999s)]
*  oh, well, this is our chance. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4618.5599999999995s)]
*  If Egypt can happen in Egypt again, [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4619.839999999999s)]
*  it can happen anywhere. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4621.92s)]
*  But talking to people and my friends in Egypt [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4623.28s)]
*  that were in Tahrir Square, [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4625.88s)]
*  they've almost fell into this kind of crippling apathy [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4627.6s)]
*  that they're like, well, it's not gonna happen again. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4632.12s)]
*  We did it once. We couldn't get the change. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4635.84s)]
*  We might as well accept the status quo. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4638.4400000000005s)]
*  There's always going to be kind of the security apparatus. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4640.68s)]
*  People are always going to disappear, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4644.24s)]
*  and I'm wondering if that is true everywhere, [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4645.6s)]
*  if to a certain extent Egypt's lost its political will, [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4649.4800000000005s)]
*  that it's gonna be almost impossible [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4654.360000000001s)]
*  to mobilize this population again [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4656.200000000001s)]
*  outside of the people at the opposite ends, [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4657.68s)]
*  the people like you that are in exile [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4659.76s)]
*  or that ran for parliament, [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4660.96s)]
*  or the people that are in Sinai and are extremists. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4662.56s)]
*  I'm wondering if that middle part [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4665.320000000001s)]
*  is ever going to be mobilized again, [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4667.04s)]
*  if there is an opportunity for that. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4668.280000000001s)]
*  Thank you all very, very much. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4670.56s)]
*  Now coming back to you, so we're running out of time, [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4673.4400000000005s)]
*  so each one will get, I would say, one minute, [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4675.76s)]
*  and we will then have a short break, 15 minutes, [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4679.360000000001s)]
*  and come back to our next session. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4683.76s)]
*  So thank you all very much once again, [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4687.52s)]
*  and let's start with you, Nancy. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4690.24s)]
*  Starting by Bud's question about the diversity [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4693.4400000000005s)]
*  of the terror groups, [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4696.2s)]
*  I don't think that they are competing against each other. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4699.4400000000005s)]
*  I think it's just they're taking opportunity [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4703.04s)]
*  of a gap that is there and a reason [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4706.92s)]
*  for people to join them for their target. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4710.28s)]
*  They changed it, all groups that you've mentioned, [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4714.04s)]
*  like Hassan and Waleed Sinai, [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4717.28s)]
*  as I mentioned at the beginning, [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4719.08s)]
*  worse in messaging, very quickly and very adaptively. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4722.96s)]
*  And that's one of their biggest strengths, [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4728.56s)]
*  because this is all what they can do [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4730.84s)]
*  because they are not as powerful as they seem. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4733.76s)]
*  They have the ability to inflict that harm [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4737.32s)]
*  that they promised, but at the same time, [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4741.32s)]
*  they're still, I mean, if there's the right strategy [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4744.96s)]
*  in place, there is an ability to control. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4747.88s)]
*  Going to the question of what do these people want, [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4751.52s)]
*  and if they are just bored young men, [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4755.4s)]
*  I don't think they are bored at all. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4759.6s)]
*  They are struggling all the time, [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4763.24s)]
*  and they are dealing with a lot of sufferings, [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4765.12s)]
*  economically, in terms of their basic rights and freedoms [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4768.32s)]
*  and basically, in some areas in Europe, just survival. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4773.36s)]
*  I mean, just meaning their basic needs. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4777.96s)]
*  So they're not bored men, and they're not just men. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4780.8s)]
*  And what do they need is just basic rights, [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4785.68s)]
*  like anyone would want. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4788.96s)]
*  The question about if the government is not seeing [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4792.0s)]
*  how this is a fertile ground for creating radicalization, [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4795.92s)]
*  and whether or not also combining that with the question [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4801.48s)]
*  of if there's apathy out there right now in Egypt. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4803.92s)]
*  I think the government sees that there are huge problems [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4809.0s)]
*  facing the country, but I think the response, [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4813.48s)]
*  instead of trying to address those, [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4818.04s)]
*  is just putting the stopper back on those problems, [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4820.04s)]
*  and silencing everyone. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4824.08s)]
*  They have some conditions that are working well [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4826.76s)]
*  for the government, they're not sustainable. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4829.92s)]
*  Some of these conditions, is the relative stable position [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4831.6s)]
*  of Egypt, or status of the rest of the region, [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4835.96s)]
*  particularly when we compare. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4839.64s)]
*  They're using sort of an extortionist argument [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4842.44s)]
*  when they talk to the immediately. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4847.04s)]
*  Or the United States is that we are actually, [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4850.64s)]
*  you don't want to see the country in refugee crisis [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4853.8s)]
*  that erupted in Syria coming from Egypt [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4857.84s)]
*  with a country of over 19 million people. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4859.68s)]
*  So that's also working well for them, [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4862.64s)]
*  as sort of getting international support [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4864.8s)]
*  to the current regime. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4868.28s)]
*  And the third thing is just the, [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4869.32s)]
*  what we see as a lack of alternative, [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4874.36s)]
*  or a lack of obvious alternative right now, [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4876.16s)]
*  which works well with, and they play on this narrative [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4878.8s)]
*  with the people who are seeing it as well, [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4881.6s)]
*  and the Egyptian people, what's happening there. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4884.52s)]
*  Is there apathy? [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4887.04s)]
*  I don't think so, and I wouldn't call it apathy, [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4888.0s)]
*  I call it struggling more. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4890.2s)]
*  Despite all the unprecedented levels of repression [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4893.360000000001s)]
*  that we're seeing in the country, [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4896.72s)]
*  in terms of imprisonment, and forced disappearance, [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4897.92s)]
*  and travel bans, you name it, [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4900.320000000001s)]
*  people are still trying to find ways to work. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4903.64s)]
*  So, slightly organizations that had their assets [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4906.92s)]
*  freed are working from home. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4909.400000000001s)]
*  Websites, for example, like Madama's, [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4912.56s)]
*  whose website would have been banned from Egypt, [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4914.8s)]
*  are posting on Facebook and other channels. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4916.8s)]
*  I mean, there's still this perseverance [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4919.8s)]
*  to continue on doing work, following up on what's happening, [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4922.400000000001s)]
*  and continuing the advocacy work that they are doing. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4926.04s)]
*  So apathy is not a word that I would use [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4928.92s)]
*  to describe the current situation. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4931.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, quickly, so I think I mentioned earlier [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4934.32s)]
*  that the Herak actually published a very succinct demands [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4936.92s)]
*  for, during the protest, the manifesto, [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4939.719999999999s)]
*  which they demanded a cancer hospital, [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4942.16s)]
*  a university, improved infrastructure, [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4946.5199999999995s)]
*  namely a highway, and jobs, so, for that question. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4948.5599999999995s)]
*  And thank you for the economic question, [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4952.04s)]
*  because that was actually a point [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4954.5599999999995s)]
*  that I really wanted to get to, [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4956.04s)]
*  which is that one of the factors [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4957.04s)]
*  that plays into this whole thing was, [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4959.5599999999995s)]
*  earlier this year, Morocco was supposed to implement [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4961.639999999999s)]
*  its first stage of floating the currency, [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4963.719999999999s)]
*  and the day before, literally the day before, [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4965.92s)]
*  actually hours, the central bank sent out an email [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4969.32s)]
*  to all the journalists saying, [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4972.76s)]
*  it's been indefinitely postponed, with no given reason. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4975.04s)]
*  And I think we all can kind of discern that the fear was that [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4978.6s)]
*  there may possibly be an Egyptian scenario [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4982.96s)]
*  with just the increasing inflation rate, [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4985.52s)]
*  but also there was, I think, yeah, exactly, [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4989.52s)]
*  so $4.4 billion of the foreign reserves were depleted [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4992.72s)]
*  in the last four months, and that was largely attributed [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=4997.56s)]
*  to speculation of the devaluation of the currency. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5000.68s)]
*  So that's the sort of general economic context [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5004.04s)]
*  for REEF specifically. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5007.320000000001s)]
*  The latest figures, as per the High Commission of Planning, [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5009.08s)]
*  say that unemployment rates in the REEF is at 16%, [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5012.4400000000005s)]
*  which is way above the national average of around 9%, [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5016.16s)]
*  and they have the lowest rate of public [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5019.96s)]
*  and private investment, and many interpret that [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5022.04s)]
*  as sort of like a punishment that has in the second [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5024.84s)]
*  kind of put against them because of the protests, [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5027.08s)]
*  and this has in turn prompted a huge exodus of migrants [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5031.5199999999995s)]
*  to Europe, primarily Netherlands, Belgium, and Spain, [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5034.92s)]
*  and they are essentially the economic lifeline [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5037.64s)]
*  to the REEF through reminces, so. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5039.72s)]
*  Thank you, Sam. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5043.68s)]
*  Raida? [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5044.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes, so I mean, just on the point on ISIS, [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5045.36s)]
*  Raida, and how different and similar these are, [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5048.72s)]
*  it's a very important point because I think [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5050.76s)]
*  we're still, even the counter-terrorism, [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5053.280000000001s)]
*  all the security policy are responding to one type [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5055.400000000001s)]
*  of a group, one type of terrorist, [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5058.24s)]
*  that only exist anymore in their minds. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5059.88s)]
*  In the ground, there have been so many of them. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5062.24s)]
*  There is ISIS, there is Qaeda, there is Ansar al-Sharia, [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5063.72s)]
*  and these are all very different groups, [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5066.84s)]
*  some full-time terrorists, part-time terrorists, [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5069.08s)]
*  some, you know, it's a very different dynamic, [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5071.24s)]
*  and it's important to identify them, [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5073.24s)]
*  and it's important to see how they function. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5074.96s)]
*  In Al-Bayda, for example, Middle Yemen, [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5077.320000000001s)]
*  I just like one minute, [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5079.0s)]
*  I'll just have to marginalize that. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5079.8s)]
*  Sure, sure, sure. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5081.2s)]
*  No. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5082.04s)]
*  Like the usual case. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5082.88s)]
*  So on that. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5085.88s)]
*  You're sharing a panel with marginalized intellectuals. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5087.2s)]
*  No, but it's important to understand [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5091.88s)]
*  the type of these groups and how they function [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5094.04s)]
*  because they're not one coherent group. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5096.32s)]
*  In Middle Yemen, for example, [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5099.4s)]
*  people who were fighting with al-Dahab, [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5101.04s)]
*  who was killed by drone strike, refused to break. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5102.6s)]
*  They say, we didn't sign up for this. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5104.8s)]
*  We signed up to fight with you not to break. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5106.68s)]
*  That's not our job. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5108.4s)]
*  It's a very, from a political science point of view, [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5109.24s)]
*  I think there should be an investment [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5111.44s)]
*  in trying to understand this. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5112.719999999999s)]
*  Second, I don't think this is as much about bored young men [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5114.32s)]
*  as much as the problem is we have states [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5118.679999999999s)]
*  that are run by boring old men. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5121.24s)]
*  And that's their main difference [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5126.12s)]
*  between them and the militia. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5127.719999999999s)]
*  The militias have young, they are quick, [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5130.08s)]
*  and they move, and they are efficient. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5131.5199999999995s)]
*  Look to Tunisia, you look to Yemen, [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5133.2s)]
*  you look to the Gulf, you look to Egypt. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5134.719999999999s)]
*  These are countries where there are people [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5136.32s)]
*  running them, older, between 70s and 80s. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5139.16s)]
*  And they have the highest demographics [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5141.08s)]
*  of young people around the world. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5142.639999999999s)]
*  That's really tremendous a problem [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5144.44s)]
*  no one focuses on and no one looks into. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5146.36s)]
*  Finally, where to start in Yemen? [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5148.679999999999s)]
*  I think it's very important to go back to 2216 resolution [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5151.24s)]
*  inside the UN Security Council. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5154.2s)]
*  That is a resolution that commits to war, [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5155.719999999999s)]
*  and we need the resolution that commits to peace in Yemen. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5158.12s)]
*  And that is the only, [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5160.32s)]
*  or that's the beginning to start with it. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5161.48s)]
*  Is Yemen has a chance? [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5163.48s)]
*  You know, I agree. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5164.48s)]
*  I think there is a problem with it. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5165.719999999999s)]
*  There is a lot of problems, but I bet you [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5167.16s)]
*  the differences between Hashid and Bakil tribes in Yemen [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5169.5199999999995s)]
*  are so much less than those right now, [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5173.68s)]
*  or those divisions between the Republicans and Democrats. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5175.8s)]
*  It's a place that can function ultimately. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5179.0s)]
*  It can run this. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5180.88s)]
*  What does the way look like? [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5181.72s)]
*  Probably federal Yemen. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5182.92s)]
*  It has to be changed. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5184.4s)]
*  It has to be not done the way it was done, [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5185.24s)]
*  which is a harsh, harsh, not thought of a process, [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5187.88s)]
*  but that can be something. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5190.2s)]
*  And that's a formula I think that we can manage [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5191.5199999999995s)]
*  and should end up managing, working, [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5194.2s)]
*  if there is enough regional, international commitment [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5195.96s)]
*  toward it. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5199.08s)]
*  Right now there is none. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5199.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5200.76s)]
*  Please join me in thanking our panelists. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5201.6s)]
*  We will have a 10 minute break [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5202.92s)]
*  and come back to the next session. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b7VaVk1VyU&t=5208.08s)]
