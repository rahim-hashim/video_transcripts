# Sectarianism and Conflict in the Middle East - Domestic and Institutional Sources
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [November 14, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0)
*  Hello everybody. I'd like to welcome you back to the second panel of this event on sectarianism [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=0.0s)]
*  in the Middle East. My name is Mark Lynch. I'm a professor at George Washington University [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=8.08s)]
*  and a non-resident associate here at the Carnegie Middle East Center. And I'm delighted to be [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=12.68s)]
*  able to moderate this second panel. We'll be going in the order starting as far away [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=19.04s)]
*  from me as possible. We'll be starting with Justin Gengler, who is, make sure I get this [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=25.919999999999998s)]
*  right, research program manager at Qatar University. Then Alexander Siegel from New York University, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=31.96s)]
*  Alex Henley from Oxford University, and Joe Behout from the world. So Justin, the floor [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=37.68s)]
*  is yours. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=48.0s)]
*  Wow, you can still see it. Okay, well, thank you very much, Mark, and thanks, Fred, for [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=49.0s)]
*  this invitation. I just wanted to make sure that everyone knew my background, which is [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=56.52s)]
*  in survey research and public opinions, collecting public opinion data, and with the sort of, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=65.32s)]
*  at the risk of potentially drawing this towards a more academic rather than policy discussion. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=73.16s)]
*  This is going to inform, sort of, it does inform the work in my chapter, but also sort [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=78.44s)]
*  of the way that I'm coming at this question of sectarianism. I'm looking in particular [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=82.52s)]
*  at the political economy of sectarianism, which you might think is sort of a strange [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=86.92s)]
*  combination, economics and sectarianism, and what does that really mean? And what you could, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=92.36s)]
*  another way of thinking about it is sort of rationalist explanations for sectarian behavior, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=97.28s)]
*  both on the part of citizens and on the part of states. And so if you think about the way [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=102.04s)]
*  that sectarianism is often described and talked about, not always maybe by more serious [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=107.88s)]
*  scholars, but sort of the average description of sectarianism, it's something very bad that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=113.16s)]
*  happens. You might have different impressions about why it happens, but the question or [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=117.88s)]
*  the conclusion is sort of, it's this bad thing that happens as a result of some processes [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=123.16s)]
*  that we may or may not understand, and how do we avoid it? And so my chapter in the book [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=127.72s)]
*  sort of takes a different angle and tries to understand what are some of the reasons [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=133.48s)]
*  why people might engage in sectarian behavior? What are the sort of behavioral underpinnings [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=136.6s)]
*  of sectarianism, both from the perspective of a state whose job it is or whose aim is to remain [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=140.76s)]
*  in power, and from the standpoint of citizens who are just sort of trying to interact with their [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  fellow citizens, trying to engage politically, trying to live their lives, sort of in an ordinary [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=152.12s)]
*  sense. So how do we understand the motivators of sectarian politics in particular? The chapter [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  looks at the GCC states. I'm coming from Qatar University, and my background is in Bahrain and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=163.0s)]
*  and Qatar to a lesser extent, and so I'm looking in particular at the way that Gulf states or [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=168.52s)]
*  sectarianism is manifested in the Arab Gulf states, which arguably is sort of the main epicenter of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=174.68s)]
*  this question since sort of maybe moved from Iraq to the Gulf since the Arab uprisings. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=181.64s)]
*  So this builds on some new work, not all by myself, by people like Stephen Brook who look at [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=188.83999999999997s)]
*  sectarianism in contexts where there are no Shia, for example, in the case of Egypt, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=197.95999999999998s)]
*  or in countries where sectarianism shouldn't exist, right? So the question is, well, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=203.32s)]
*  if you have anti-Shia sentiment that leads to deaths of individuals in a place like Egypt where [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=208.04s)]
*  Shia are not actually a political constituency that threatens the status quo, and in the Maghreb [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=212.28s)]
*  as well, then how do we think about it and what's really driving it? So one side of this is on the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=220.12s)]
*  standpoint of states, and so looking at sectarianism as a tool of regime security, we talked about this [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=227.32s)]
*  maybe in the first panel in the context of more non-essentialist explanations of sectarianism. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=233.16s)]
*  I don't think I go that far exactly, but looking at this sort of truism, which is often said, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=240.84s)]
*  that essentially states can scare people into accepting unpopular policies, and how does [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=247.8s)]
*  sectarianism fit into that sort of a dynamic? This is a picture of a sort of infographic [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=252.84s)]
*  advertising the Saudi National Transformation Plan, and you'll notice that this plan involves [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=261.8s)]
*  a few things that ordinary people wouldn't necessarily be welcoming, including a VAT tax, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=267.16s)]
*  for example, a new tax on goods and services, including public sector salaries will be cut [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=274.04s)]
*  40 percent of total spending, and things like this. And so it's looking at the way that [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=278.76000000000005s)]
*  sectarian politics can interact with other policies and other dynamics, including economic [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=284.28000000000003s)]
*  dynamics in the country, to help explain what's driving these things. And so the starting point [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=288.92s)]
*  of this in the Gulf Contest in particular is thinking about, and don't worry about the slide, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=293.8s)]
*  I'll talk about this, is thinking about how does politics operate in this region? The prevailing [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=299.08000000000004s)]
*  understanding of the volunteer states or the sort of oil producing states in the region, not just [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=306.04s)]
*  in the Gulf, is that states get money. When oil prices are high, they have a lot of money, so they [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=309.8s)]
*  give people a lot of money. People are relatively happy. When oil prices are low, they have less [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=315.0s)]
*  money, they give people less, and so that's when problems sort of start to occur. In reality, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=318.36s)]
*  it's not really how things work. It's more along the lines of what we were talking about in Syria, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=323.48s)]
*  where some people always sort of do better, and some people always do less well. And traditionally, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=328.36s)]
*  those sorts of differences tend to go along group-based lines, sort of ascriptive, descent-based [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=335.48s)]
*  lines for different reasons. We can talk about that. This is just an example of this in the case [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=342.6s)]
*  of Bahrain. This uses survey data to explain the things that determine whether or not a citizen [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=348.44s)]
*  in Bahrain is employed in the public sector as a function of their concentration in the neighborhood [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=354.6s)]
*  where they live. And so you'll see, if you're a Sunni living in a 100 percent Sunni neighborhood, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=360.76s)]
*  you have a 75 percent chance of living in the public sector, whereas if you're a Shia living in [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=365.0s)]
*  an entirely Shia neighborhood, you have a 30 percent chance of living in a public sector. So [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=369.15999999999997s)]
*  clearly, these sorts of economic outcomes are not just random chance. There are important [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=374.28s)]
*  distributional implications to sectarian identity. This looks at another factor. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=379.8s)]
*  On the side of citizens, we have, again, to sort of understand this puzzle of why do people engage [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=386.28s)]
*  in what is in many cases a costly behavior, expressing publicly sentiments against another [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=393.56s)]
*  group. I mean, it's not necessarily a socially acceptable thing to say that you dislike other [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=401.32s)]
*  people on the basis of some ethnic characteristic, right, if you just think about social relations. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=405.15999999999997s)]
*  And so one way that people are thinking about this is looking at sectarianism as a form of peer [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=410.12s)]
*  pressure. There's a sort of social conformity element where either because of the prevailing [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=415.0s)]
*  narrative or religious or political narrative, people feel pressured into these sort of sectarian [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=420.84s)]
*  attitudes and behaviors. And this is where work on Egypt, for example, has gone. They're using [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=425.96000000000004s)]
*  the case of this country where they literally have maybe one percent of the population or less, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=432.68s)]
*  which is Shia, but all of a sudden three or four years ago had these outbreaks of sectarian violence [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=437.08000000000004s)]
*  in and around Cairo that led to the deaths of many people in a sort of gruesome fashion. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=442.20000000000005s)]
*  And this is a sort of picture of the funeral procession from those events. Another thing that [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=445.8s)]
*  you might think about in the context of why individuals might engage in sectarianism in a [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=454.68s)]
*  country like, let's say Bahrain, is in a case where the state itself has very overtly come out [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=458.36s)]
*  in favor of one sectarian position versus another, then is expressing sectarian attitudes as an [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=464.44s)]
*  ordinary citizen, is that a signal of disliking the other group or is that a signal of just [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=473.08s)]
*  supporting the state in the state's own position? I mean, is it a signal of political support? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=479.32s)]
*  You're saying, yeah, I support you on that thing, just like you might support the state on its [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=483.24s)]
*  retirement policy, or is it actually reflective of an underlying hatred of Shia, let's say, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=488.52s)]
*  or something like this? And so I think there are important behavioral elements on the side of [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=493.40000000000003s)]
*  citizens as well as states that are not exactly understood. My contribution for the book, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=498.44s)]
*  to sort of briefly outline it, focuses on this question from the standpoint of the state behavior. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=506.92s)]
*  So how do states gain from sectarianism, both specifically as a specific [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=511.56s)]
*  strategy, but also more broadly from the outcomes that sectarianism generates, which is basically [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=519.64s)]
*  feelings of insecurity, feelings of conflict, feelings of instability. And so what it takes [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=525.08s)]
*  as its starting point is this post-2011 concern among citizens in the Gulf region, in particular [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=532.44s)]
*  for stability, which is not hard to explain given that all you have to do is turn on the TV [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=537.96s)]
*  or the radio, all these places, with graphic images from places like Yemen, from Syria, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=543.5600000000001s)]
*  and other things that seem to drive home the point that when you go down the path of revolution or [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=550.84s)]
*  the path of change, bad things tend to happen, especially if there are malicious regional actors [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=556.6800000000001s)]
*  that are looking to take advantage. And so what we've seen, accordingly, this is based on some [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=560.2s)]
*  survey data that my suit collected from Qatar, is that the priority that ordinary citizens give [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=565.24s)]
*  stability versus other types of national goals, when you ask them to choose between different [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=570.76s)]
*  goals that a nation might prioritize or they might prioritize for their country, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=576.12s)]
*  stability has really jumped up. From something like 30 percent of citizens in 2011, I think it was [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=580.2s)]
*  even lower, maybe to 10 or 20 percent in 2010 before the Arab Spring, to 75 percent of people [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=586.44s)]
*  in 2014. The newer data, I think we've just received recently, it's up to 80 percent. 80 percent [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=592.28s)]
*  of people now prioritize stability over these other competing national goals. And so what does that do [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=598.12s)]
*  politically? Does that make people more deferential to decisions that they don't [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=604.36s)]
*  necessarily agree with simply because they now prioritize stability? And how does sectarianism [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=609.16s)]
*  sort of raising this threat of this, either internal, in the case of Shia populations or [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=615.16s)]
*  Muslim Brotherhood populations or Salafist populations, or external, Iran, other actors, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=619.64s)]
*  how does that both drive this concern for stability and then via that concern for stability, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=626.92s)]
*  how does that impact how people think about politics and how they react to things that [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=635.4s)]
*  might be unpopular, such as, for example, the National Transformation Plan and other reform [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=639.8s)]
*  agendas going on in the GCC? And so essentially what the chapter does is uses some survey data [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=645.16s)]
*  collected in 2016, 2017, from five of the six GCC states, all the GCC states except for the UAE, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=651.88s)]
*  which declined to participate in the survey, and divided people in this, this is a simplistic [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=659.7199999999999s)]
*  explanation, but essentially divided people into three groups or even two groups, let's say. People [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=668.36s)]
*  who are concerned about stability, so the people who are sort of in that first category over here [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=672.68s)]
*  on the left-hand side, and everybody else. And then it asks the question, okay, so how does the [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=677.4799999999999s)]
*  political behavior of the first group differ from the second group and what does it mean [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=684.92s)]
*  substantively in terms of regime security in the Gulf? And what you find is this common pattern [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=690.5999999999999s)]
*  among four of the five surveyed states, the exception is Oman, and I guess we could talk [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=697.48s)]
*  about that if people are really interested in Oman, is that concern over stability essentially [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=703.4s)]
*  breaks the link between economic satisfaction on the one hand and political satisfaction on [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=709.88s)]
*  the other hand, which operates sort of in the Gulf and other Rwanda states. So it means that [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=714.04s)]
*  if you're concerned about security and stability above other national goals, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=718.12s)]
*  your political, your deference to unpopular political decisions as measured through some [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=722.2800000000001s)]
*  survey questions is entirely unrelated to your own economic satisfaction, because of course you [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=726.6800000000001s)]
*  don't care as much about your economic satisfaction relative to this other goal that you have [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=731.1600000000001s)]
*  of security. So this is a summary of that result, which is that if you have one person in a country, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=735.24s)]
*  let's say in Bahrain or Kuwait or Qatar or whatever, who is economically dissatisfied, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=742.44s)]
*  objectively economically satisfied, so maybe on a scale from zero to 10, he's in the lowest 25th [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=746.92s)]
*  percentile, but he's not concerned over stability. He names some other goal as his top national goal, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=752.12s)]
*  let's say democracy or perfecting the environment or economic development. And then another person [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=757.56s)]
*  from the same country who's also economically dissatisfied at the exact same position on the [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=763.9599999999999s)]
*  sort of economic satisfaction ladder. But this person names as their national goal security and [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=767.96s)]
*  stability, maintaining the system, these sorts of concepts. The second person is 50 or 80 percent, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=777.5600000000001s)]
*  so almost twice as likely in some cases depends on the country, to defer to government decision [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=785.64s)]
*  making. So the exact survey question, which has been used in a lot of surveys in the region, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=791.24s)]
*  is that citizens should always agree with government decisions, support government [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=795.48s)]
*  decisions, even if they disagree with those decisions. And so people in this high prioritization [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=800.04s)]
*  of security category are 50 or 80 percent more likely to strongly agree with that sort of a [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=805.5600000000001s)]
*  statement, which underlines the importance then and the sort of economic interest that states have [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=811.24s)]
*  in what? In increasing the proportion of citizens who are in that category, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=816.28s)]
*  because now you don't have to provide for them economically. It's essentially an economic subsidy. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=821.32s)]
*  These people are no longer connected to you via your increasing their material circumstances, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=825.64s)]
*  but because of this other link, which doesn't cost you anything. I mean, it might cost you things, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=831.72s)]
*  but it costs you less money. And so if you can only scare people more, either by, let's say, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=835.48s)]
*  having wars in Yemen or by raising the threat of domestic and international actors, then your [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=840.36s)]
*  economic burden as a state really decreases dramatically. And that's the point of the chapter. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=848.84s)]
*  And I'll end there. Thank you. I'll hear from Alexandra Siegel. Nice to switch with you so I [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=855.72s)]
*  can see the things. Sure. Sorry. Hard to see the slides from that angle. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=862.2s)]
*  Coming up in a sec. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=870.76s)]
*  Okay, great. Thank you so much to Fred for organizing this. And it's really exciting to [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=871.96s)]
*  finally see the book in print after almost a couple of years. So my chapter of the book kind [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=885.32s)]
*  of comes out of a broader research agenda that I have as part of my dissertation, which is this [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=893.72s)]
*  idea that during the Arab Spring, there was all this optimism of the role that social media could [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=899.8s)]
*  play in democratization and empowering new voices across the region. But then, you know, five years [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=904.68s)]
*  on, the question that I think is really important to ask is what role is social media playing in [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=911.7199999999999s)]
*  the crises and conflicts that have been left in the wake of the Arab Spring around the region? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=916.28s)]
*  So that so this work kind of fits into that broader research agenda. And in terms of this paper, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=921.16s)]
*  some of the general research objectives are to ask how does social media affect the dynamics of [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=927.96s)]
*  local, national, transnational sectarianism in the Arab world, but also perhaps more importantly, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=933.1600000000001s)]
*  what can social media data teach researchers and policymakers about the day-to-day microdynamics [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=939.48s)]
*  of sectarian conflict in the region? So I think in order to motivate this, it's important to kind [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=945.24s)]
*  of take a step back and people start talking about social media as this sort of new phenomenon, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=951.96s)]
*  and particularly in the context of sectarian conflict that as the Syrian Civil War escalated, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=957.0s)]
*  suddenly there is a sort of this narrative about an outpouring of online hate speech and this idea [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=964.04s)]
*  that this is a totally new phenomenon. But I think it's more useful to contextualize it in to the [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=968.92s)]
*  role of media in conflict more broadly. So if we take a step back kind of across the region, media [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=974.44s)]
*  has long played an important role in empowering various political and religious elites to spread [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=980.52s)]
*  all sorts of narratives. And sort of a common example that comes up is thinking about Nasser [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=986.84s)]
*  using radio to spread Arab nationalism, but perhaps more closely related to the discussion [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=991.4s)]
*  of sectarianism. If you look at Sadat's use of radio in the late 70s, the kind of anti-Shi'a [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=997.4s)]
*  messages he was putting out when talking about Hafez al-Assad in Syria really speak a lot to the [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1003.64s)]
*  sorts of narratives we hear today and are a similar example of thinking about elites taking [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1010.44s)]
*  advantage of new tools to spread different kinds of political and ideological messages in the region. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1015.08s)]
*  And so there's been a lot of discussion also about the growth of satellite television, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1022.2800000000001s)]
*  for example, and particularly sectarian media outlets that after the Iraq War got underway and [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1026.68s)]
*  sectarian tensions escalated, these media channels took on these sort of decidedly sectarian narratives. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1035.72s)]
*  But I think no matter which form of media we're talking about, whether new media or more traditional [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1042.28s)]
*  media, it's useful to think about the fact that this is a long-standing phenomenon where [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1047.16s)]
*  different actors take advantage of the media tools available to them to try to spread these [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1052.6s)]
*  narratives for different political aims. At the same time, there might be something qualitatively [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1058.2s)]
*  different about social media. So what might be different about this new media form? And I think [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1065.16s)]
*  in my research, my feeling is that what's primarily different is the existence of these [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1071.08s)]
*  platforms where elite, everyday citizens, media outlets, armed groups, extremist groups, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1077.56s)]
*  are all operating on the same platform, putting out information, interacting with each other. And so [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1084.36s)]
*  you see these evolving narratives that are coming from the top down, from the bottom up, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1091.0s)]
*  at the same time. And in some ways, that is fundamentally different than these other [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1095.56s)]
*  media sources, which everyday citizens and actors with less clout and economic capabilities [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1099.56s)]
*  couldn't access in the same way. So nowadays we have on social media this user-generated content, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1107.0s)]
*  which is much harder to control. And you get all sorts of actors, both those with more power and [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1113.96s)]
*  those who previously wouldn't have had a real voice in the debate entering conversation here. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1122.9199999999998s)]
*  So there's a lot of discussion of this, and many analysts of social media data have talked about [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1129.32s)]
*  the proliferation of echo chambers and this idea of when thinking about sectarian conflict, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1136.28s)]
*  for example, that maybe you have only Sunnis online talking to each other or only Shia online [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1140.76s)]
*  talking to each other, that that's creating these kind of hostile environments where more extremist [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1145.3999999999999s)]
*  messages get circulated. What I actually find, which I'll discuss in more detail as we move forward, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1150.6799999999998s)]
*  is that there's a lot of cross-sectarian discussion online, some of it cooperative, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1157.1599999999999s)]
*  some of it quite hostile, but we don't sort of across the region, but especially in the Gulf, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1162.04s)]
*  see these kinds of echo chamber environments where only members of one sector talking to [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1168.04s)]
*  each other online. There's actually quite a bit of interesting back and forth. And so when we look [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1173.32s)]
*  at this data, we suddenly have a new opportunity to look in real time at how all these different [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1179.48s)]
*  actors are responding to events on the ground. What kinds of narratives gain traction? Who's [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1185.8s)]
*  spreading them and where are they coming from? So one place where we've seen the spread of [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1190.76s)]
*  kind of hostile sectarian rhetoric in the online sphere is coming from particularly Salafi clerics [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1200.84s)]
*  in Saudi Arabia, and their use of anti-Shia discourse is pretty striking because they're [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1207.0s)]
*  using these hostile sectarian slurs that were once sort of more the purview of extremist groups, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1213.16s)]
*  but have entered their vocabulary. And so you have these actors, Muhammad Al-Arithi, for example, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1218.44s)]
*  as of this morning has over 20 million followers on Twitter. So when he tweets out one of these [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1223.88s)]
*  nasty anti-Shia tweets, such as the Rofid, assemble Shia women whose aim is to provide temporary [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1230.1200000000001s)]
*  marriage for Shia fighters, or these sorts of things, Jews and Christians did not used to [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1237.0800000000002s)]
*  collude with the Rofid as they do today in this country and every country, these tweets aren't [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1241.4s)]
*  just going out in the ether to a few people, they're potentially being viewed by some subset of these [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1246.3600000000001s)]
*  20 million followers and perhaps lending legitimacy to some of this more extreme rhetoric. And so what [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1251.72s)]
*  we see when we look at the proliferation of anti-Shia rhetoric over time on Twitter, and for this paper, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1259.64s)]
*  I was looking at a six-month period in 2015 because that's when the Carnegie paper that later [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1265.72s)]
*  became this book chapter came out, we see this really large spike in anti-Shia rhetoric that's [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1271.08s)]
*  occurring around the Saudi intervention in Yemen, and particularly it starts when the Houthis have [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1276.4399999999998s)]
*  this major advance and Hadi, President Hadi, flees the country. And so the question is what's driving [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1281.56s)]
*  this spike? Is it everyday citizens reacting to the news? Is it members of the royal family? Is it [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1288.04s)]
*  sectarian media outlets? And what you see when you dig into the data is it's primarily these clerics [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1294.4399999999998s)]
*  and sectarian media outlets that begin tweeting this anti-Shia content earlier on and then their [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1300.04s)]
*  tweets are retweeted at high levels by others and after that sort of gains traction then everyday [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1307.24s)]
*  citizens and other actors join the discussion. But what social media data enables us to do, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1313.72s)]
*  which we can't do so easily with more traditional data sources, is see who exactly is beginning [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1318.76s)]
*  this conversation, whose messages are gaining traction, and where do they spread. And I think [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1325.72s)]
*  that provides really important insights to us to gain a better understanding of the micro dynamics [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1330.76s)]
*  of conflict in the region. We can also look at anti-Sunni language on Twitter, which I find in [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1336.68s)]
*  my data is much smaller in volume than anti-Shia rhetoric and a lot of it is produced by sort of [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1342.52s)]
*  armed groups and accounts that are armed group supporters, but you see this really sort of [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1349.88s)]
*  dehumanizing rhetoric like, get out, oh no, there's no place for you in Ali and Hussein's Iraq, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1353.88s)]
*  for example, where you're talking about rhetoric that's really saying Iraq is for one set only. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1360.0400000000002s)]
*  And these kinds of messages don't spread as widely as the anti-Shia messages, partly because they're [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1366.3600000000001s)]
*  not produced by actors that have large followings, but they're still there and interestingly, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1374.0400000000002s)]
*  this message, for example, the get out, oh no, a message is a reply to a Sunni person who's [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1380.4399999999998s)]
*  tweeting something about the advance of the popular mobilization front in Iraq. So these people are [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1387.8s)]
*  interacting with each other and having these kind of hostile real-time conversations that we can [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1392.6799999999998s)]
*  monitor. When we look at anti-Sunni rhetoric, it tends to spike around different, in this period [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1397.4799999999998s)]
*  anyway, around different clashes like the Tikrit offensive and recapture clashes in Ramadi, but [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1403.56s)]
*  also in the aftermath of ISIS-related attacks like the attack on a Shia mosque in Saudi Arabia [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1409.96s)]
*  or the release of like a viral ISIS video, for example. Then we can think also about counter [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1416.44s)]
*  sectarian messages that appear, and here are a couple of examples from Wabadon. In this picture, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1424.6000000000001s)]
*  you have this guy who is being split in half by the word sectarianism and it says national unity [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1430.04s)]
*  across his body and the tweet above says, don't you know that in Lebanon we are all Shia? If the [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1436.84s)]
*  Shia are threatened, we are all Sunni. If the Sunni are threatened, we are all Christian. If the [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1442.04s)]
*  Christians are threatened, we are all Lebanon. And these kinds of messages also are fairly popular [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1446.12s)]
*  online, but they don't tend to gain the same kind of traction as the anti-Shia rhetoric. And we saw [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1453.9599999999998s)]
*  a lot of them in the Gulf emerging, as I'll show you here, in the aftermath of the two attacks in [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1460.4399999999998s)]
*  Saudi Arabia on Shia mosques and also particularly the attack on a Kuwaiti Shia mosque in this period [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1466.9199999999998s)]
*  in 2015 where the message would instead be, you know, we're all Kuwaiti or we're all Saudi, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1474.28s)]
*  etc. But what's interesting about this language is it's often met by a strong backlash online, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1479.9599999999998s)]
*  particularly in the Gulf from people who say this is all Shia propaganda. What are you talking about? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1485.88s)]
*  We're all Kuwaiti. Clearly, you know, Iran is behind ISIS and this attack and there's all kind [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1491.96s)]
*  of conspiratorial rhetoric that often sort of comes out as a backlash to the counter sectarian [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1498.1200000000001s)]
*  messages. So just to recap kind of the primary findings that are in the book chapter, we have [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1506.5200000000002s)]
*  these diverse violent events which are driving fluctuation both in sectarian rhetoric but also [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1512.6s)]
*  in the volume of counter sectarian rhetoric. We see clerics and sectarian media outlets and also [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1518.28s)]
*  influential Gulf elites playing an important role in spreading this rhetoric online. And I think [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1524.9199999999998s)]
*  what's particularly problematic about this is it lends credence to a lot of extremist messages. So [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1530.9199999999998s)]
*  ISIS accounts are also tweeting anti-Shia rhetoric, but they're not getting retweeted at high rates. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1535.7199999999998s)]
*  Then at the same time, you have these well-known actors with large followings putting out quite [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1542.28s)]
*  similar statements, which I think touches a bit on what Cole was talking about this morning with [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1547.0s)]
*  the sort of overlapping narratives between extremist groups and more mainstream actors that kind of [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1551.08s)]
*  blur the lines of whose message is whose. Another important point that I mentioned is I think it's [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1556.76s)]
*  useful to note that we have these ideologically diverse actors that are engaging with one another [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1564.2s)]
*  and arguing with one another, sometimes productively, sometimes probably counter-productively [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1569.48s)]
*  on Twitter, but we don't see just these pure echo chamber environments that are often [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1574.84s)]
*  discussed. And then finally, this idea that most counter sectarian narratives really lack elite [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1579.4s)]
*  support and so they're not spreading very quickly or to large audiences and often fail to gain [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1584.84s)]
*  traction and, as I said before, often viewed with suspicion. So I have a current project that's in [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1591.32s)]
*  the works right now where I'm doing an experiment to see what kinds of counter sectarian narratives [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1597.4s)]
*  people might find more compelling. And I have, it's partly a survey experiment, but I also have these [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1602.2800000000002s)]
*  bots that I've created that are tweeting various counter sectarian messages at people tweeting anti-Shia [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1608.0400000000002s)]
*  content online. So we'll see when those results come out if there's anything more promising with [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1613.96s)]
*  certain kinds of messages that might be able to gain a bit more traction, but that's an open-ended [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1620.2s)]
*  question at this point. So thank you so much. Great, thank you. Now we'll turn to Alex Helme. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1625.8s)]
*  Thank you. Good morning. So I'm going to keep the conversation about clerics going for a bit. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1633.1599999999999s)]
*  We've heard a lot about Saudi clerics from Alex in a little in the last panel. I'm going to focus [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1639.8s)]
*  on clerics in Lebanon and really seeing quite a different thing going on when looking at religious [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1646.84s)]
*  authority and sectarianism in Lebanon. I've looked at clerics, the kinds of clerics that I've looked [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1654.2s)]
*  at have been the kind of officially recognized heads of various religious communities in Lebanon. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1664.68s)]
*  And I think they're a great example of how clerical politics can work in relation to [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1672.3600000000001s)]
*  sectarianism in multi-confessional countries. So perhaps like Iraq, like Syria, maybe Egypt. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1678.52s)]
*  And I think you see quite a different thing going on from what you might see amongst these [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1687.56s)]
*  these Saudi clerics. And I think there are lessons to be learned from Lebanon's history of [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1692.8400000000001s)]
*  governmental engagement with these clerics, with these religious authorities. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1701.96s)]
*  The Lebanese state has been engaging with heads of communities, religious heads of communities, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1707.24s)]
*  for over almost a hundred years, ever since it was created, and are very much part of the [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1715.8s)]
*  confessional system that we're going to hear a bit more about from Joe in a moment. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1726.44s)]
*  And I think increasingly nowadays we have politicians and diplomats seeing conflict in [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1730.52s)]
*  the Middle East as driven by polarized religious identities. They're looking to engage with [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1736.68s)]
*  religious leaders as representatives of these identity groups. And it seems like a common [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1742.28s)]
*  sense solution. Who better to speak to when dealing with with sectarianism than the leaders [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1747.56s)]
*  with sectarianism than the leaders of these sects. So what I've tried to do in my contribution to [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1755.0s)]
*  this to this book was look a bit at who these religious leaders really are, who do they [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1762.76s)]
*  represent, what do they represent, and should we see them as part of the problem of sectarianism, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1770.04s)]
*  should we see them as as potentially part of the solution, how should policymakers deal with these [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1775.8s)]
*  figures. And the first point to note is that these heads of religious communities, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1781.72s)]
*  as we see them in Lebanon, are not the ones inciting sectarian hatred. And I think we end [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1791.72s)]
*  up very easily with kind of a caricature of clerics as pretty much walking embodiments of [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1799.0s)]
*  sectarian difference as preaching incompatible world views that that lead their followers then [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1806.36s)]
*  into conflict with each other. And in a sense I think these kinds of caricatures give religious [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1815.24s)]
*  leaders almost too much credit. In reality what we find when we look at look at these senior religious [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1823.1599999999999s)]
*  figures is that they're officials, they're essentially bureaucrats most of the time, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1832.2s)]
*  they've risen out of they've risen out of hierarchical bureaucratic religious institutions [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1837.88s)]
*  and they're not charismatic rabble rousers, they haven't kind of arisen out of the masses [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1847.48s)]
*  as natural leaders and they might have influence but it's not a very clearly [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1853.08s)]
*  there's not a clear link between religious leaders and some kind of ready-made religious followership. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1864.1999999999998s)]
*  You also find that these institutions are heavily invested in the modern nation state, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1874.84s)]
*  in the state order. They benefit from their control of family law courts, from [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1880.36s)]
*  running publicly owned mosques, from salaries from state budgets, funding state funding for [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1892.1999999999998s)]
*  religious schools and colleges, all this kind of thing. These religious institutions are very much [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1900.12s)]
*  invested in the status quo in a state system that's based on confessional coexistence in a [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1906.28s)]
*  place like Lebanon and you'd see that in Iraq as well for instance. And so you have these religious [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1916.68s)]
*  leaders rising out of institutions that are very much kind of part of the ideology of the state, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1923.3999999999999s)]
*  part of the structure of the state and they become religious leaders by [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1931.64s)]
*  succeeding within that hierarchy. They start off like any elite, they go to the right schools, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1940.68s)]
*  their families place them in the right jobs in the central religious administration, they play the [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1947.0800000000002s)]
*  game and largely those who end up in charge of these religious institutions are also those who've [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1953.16s)]
*  never really upset anyone, they've never really drawn enough attention to have had themselves [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1963.0800000000002s)]
*  blacklisted by the various political interests involved in appointments to the top offices even [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1969.0s)]
*  in religious institutions. So often these guys, they're the uncontroversial ones who've kind of [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1976.76s)]
*  risen to the top. There's a very very far cry I think from the image we sometimes have a little [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1985.64s)]
*  naively of what religious leaders are all about. Having kind of taken them down a notch, they do [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=1993.56s)]
*  have a great potential that we see throughout Lebanese history for actively defusing sectarian [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2003.16s)]
*  tensions and they can do that by making kind of symbolic stands. We've seen over the last five [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2012.3600000000001s)]
*  years say since the war started in Syria and the role of Hezbollah in Lebanon has become [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2023.32s)]
*  particularly politicized and a particular kind of bone of contention between different communities, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2033.0s)]
*  an interesting thing that's happened is that each of the leaders of the main religious communities [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2040.68s)]
*  has deliberately taken a symbolic stand with the opposing community as it's been seen. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2045.96s)]
*  So the religious leader of the Shia community has been very critical of Hezbollah during these years [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2054.84s)]
*  and the Sunni Mufti and the Maronite patriarch have both reached out to Hezbollah and tried to [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2063.6400000000003s)]
*  build bridges. Very clearly trying to cross the divide and you end up seeing this throughout [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2072.92s)]
*  Lebanese history. You see it all the way back to the civil war of 1958. Maronite patriarch of that [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2080.28s)]
*  time very famously stood with the Muslim opposition to a Maronite president. So you have these kind of [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2087.96s)]
*  symbolic acts through which these leaders can use their status, the status they achieve through [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2096.52s)]
*  these institutions to address what they see as a kind of rising sectarian problem. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2102.12s)]
*  So that's kind of the good side potentially, something we can engage with them over. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2110.2000000000003s)]
*  On the other hand you could say that their very existence in public life in a country like Lebanon [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2117.16s)]
*  works to inhibit social integration. It helps divide the population through this symbolic role [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2123.32s)]
*  they play unless they're using it in this very strategic way. But we often have, you often see [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2130.84s)]
*  images of the various religious leaders of Lebanese communities used as a way of representing [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2138.76s)]
*  sectarian division in society. They've become symbolic of these divisions and they also in [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2145.16s)]
*  enforce them practically. The religious institutions have a huge amount of power over [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2152.6s)]
*  people's daily lives. Family law courts effectively prevent intermarriage between [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2158.12s)]
*  sects will make it very difficult. And these religious institutions of course administer [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2166.52s)]
*  schools and all kinds of key life events. They channel people into [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2174.68s)]
*  kind of different communal tracts you could say by administering their births, marriages, divorces, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2181.72s)]
*  deaths, inheritance, the whole kind of cycle of family life. And so you have these these kind of [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2188.04s)]
*  two sides. Actively these religious leaders might play quite a positive role at times, at key times. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2195.64s)]
*  Perhaps more passively or at least in more kind of institutional terms they can be seen as part of [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2204.44s)]
*  the root of the problem. So what do we do with them? Should policymakers, should diplomats and [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2214.68s)]
*  politicians be dealing with these figures? I think there's a huge problem that we find in that [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2221.64s)]
*  because these aren't kind of naturally occurring phenomena, you know these these leaders aren't just [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2230.44s)]
*  there as organic representatives of sects, they change and we end up changing them by engaging [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2237.7200000000003s)]
*  with them. And that's what you see in Lebanese history, that by recognizing particular figures [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2246.6s)]
*  as the representatives, as the leaders, administrators of different religious communities, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2254.12s)]
*  you end up empowering them and disempowering others who would like to have a role in those [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2262.12s)]
*  those activities. And I think in Lebanon I see it as leading along with various other problems in [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2267.3199999999997s)]
*  in the confessional system of government. I think it leads to a crisis of representation. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2275.16s)]
*  You have a system of recognizing religious leaders that is intended very positively to kind [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2282.04s)]
*  of expand the scope of democratic representation, to kind of provide other means of engaging with [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2291.4s)]
*  sectarian diversity. But actually what you end up doing is empowering particular institutions as [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2299.72s)]
*  representatives and you end up excluding all kinds of people from secularist to Islamist at [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2306.12s)]
*  different extremes. And I think it kind of feeds into some of the problems that we see today [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2315.3199999999997s)]
*  that we're going to hear more about from Joe, I think. So I'll leave it there. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2322.92s)]
*  All right thank you. And now Jobarhout, the Carnegie Endowment. Thank you so much Mark. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2328.92s)]
*  First of all a word of thanks to Fred Wery for this fantastic work that he has led and I really [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2333.96s)]
*  feel lucky to have arrived at Carnegie at the time that this book was the project was launched and [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2340.44s)]
*  that I was asked to join very kindly by Fred. Thank you so much Fred and thank you Carnegie. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2347.48s)]
*  In fact I'm speaking at the end of this day of this event and I think it's not a coincidence [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2353.7200000000003s)]
*  because probably my chapter about Lebanon, the Taif agreement, the confessional system or what [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2359.56s)]
*  we call more scientifically the Conssociational Democracy system is part of particular in all this [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2365.72s)]
*  in all this complex that we are discussing because Lebanon is probably the first and only case so far [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2373.7999999999997s)]
*  where where confessionalism or sectarianism has been institutionalized and this is the headline [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2383.56s)]
*  maybe of my presentation. So it's a very specific case but at the same time and this is what I will [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2389.64s)]
*  try to end on the way to close the day it also gives lessons to the other cases. We can drive [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2395.48s)]
*  some lessons for good and for bad from Lebanon that would speak to the other cases that we have [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2403.32s)]
*  heard about or that are addressed in the book. What are the specificities first of the of the [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2409.56s)]
*  sectarian system in Lebanon that that make it really particular and to that day incomparable [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2417.24s)]
*  with our other cases? First of all it has a very deep historicity. It's a system contrary to what [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2424.04s)]
*  people could think is well entrenched in history. First of all Lebanese sectarianism, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2431.96s)]
*  a Taifiyya, CSE as we call it, is rooted in something that started in the Ottoman era. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2438.76s)]
*  It's the millet system, the way that the millet system of the Ottoman Empire starting from the [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2445.7200000000003s)]
*  end of the 17th, 18th century, early 18th century has organized the communities in the Levant by [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2451.48s)]
*  granting them the right to organize their legal system, their sociological organizations and [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2459.08s)]
*  etc. Then the French mandate came and also contrary to a cliche that is well entrenched it only in [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2466.7599999999998s)]
*  fact took it over. It prolonged it. Just remember that at the end of the ancestry of civil wars in [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2474.2799999999997s)]
*  Lebanon 1860 the famous massacres of the mountain under the Ottoman Empire the Reglement Organique, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2483.08s)]
*  Reglement Organique that Metternich put in place to end this war, the civil war, created a confessional [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2490.36s)]
*  system in Lebanon in the Mutasarifiya where you already had a governing council for Mount Lebanon [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2495.96s)]
*  of six members, three Christians and three Muslims with a Greek Catholic, a Greek Orthodox, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2502.68s)]
*  a Maronite, a Druze, a Sunni and a Shia. So it's not a new system. This is the first [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2509.72s)]
*  particularity. The second particularity, Fred this morning said it's beyond Sunni and Shia. It's not [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2516.52s)]
*  only Sunni and Shia. I would say Lebanon is beneath or before Sunni and Shia because it's an organization [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2523.16s)]
*  between Christians and Muslims which is very particular also and if you miss that point you [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2530.2s)]
*  don't understand kind of the genetics of the sectarian system in Lebanon which narrative, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2535.96s)]
*  which philosophical narrative is built on the Christian-Muslim encounter, dialogue, etc. the [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2542.04s)]
*  east-west dialogue and all this story. So this is the second particularity although, although and [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2549.16s)]
*  I don't forget that, with time especially after the 90s the sectarian system in Lebanon becomes [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2556.04s)]
*  but implicitly much more about Sunni and Shia organization but it's rooted in until today [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2562.44s)]
*  despite all the tension between Sunnis and Shia in Lebanon that is in fact the main story [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2569.0s)]
*  even of this morning. In fact the legal system, the legalization of the sectarian system in Lebanon [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2575.08s)]
*  is mainly about Christians and Muslims which is the second particularity. Now this is the first [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2583.08s)]
*  point I wanted to make. The second one is to try to tie the Lebanese sectarian system to [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2589.64s)]
*  a more, a wider family of political systems in the political science paradigm. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2596.92s)]
*  Lebanon is not a very particular case in the world. Lebanon at least in the 40s, 50s when the legal, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2605.3199999999997s)]
*  when the sectarian system was legalized under the form of the national park was part of a family of [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2612.7599999999998s)]
*  other sectarian democracies, consociational democracies in the world, ironically not in [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2619.16s)]
*  the Arab world, mainly in Europe and sometimes in Africa, Nigeria and etc. Belgium in Europe, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2625.08s)]
*  maybe other cases elsewhere that political science and famously one political scientist Aaron [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2632.2799999999997s)]
*  Cliphart studied under the name of consociational democracy saying that in societies that are [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2639.16s)]
*  heterogeneous but now of course this is the entirety of the problem. How do you define [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2646.68s)]
*  or how do you decide that a society is heterogeneous? Who defines the groups and [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2652.3599999999997s)]
*  etc. But in a society that is perceived or perceived itself as heterogeneous, democracy has [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2657.24s)]
*  to accommodate the rights of individuals meaning like a western democracy, a one man one vote, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2664.2s)]
*  but also to give rights and guarantees to the groups as they define themselves. So the demos [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2671.8s)]
*  in demos, crassia in democracy is both the individual and the group. So this is this is [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2678.52s)]
*  the architecture of the sectarian system as Lebanon took it meaning that in fact every [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2684.84s)]
*  mechanism of decision and power sharing has to take into account the rights of individuals and [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2691.4s)]
*  the rights of groupings with sometimes giving the rights of groups or groupings to the detriment of [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2698.44s)]
*  that of the individuals which is a philosophical question in Lebanon about what does individualism [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2706.2000000000003s)]
*  mean in a sectarian system but this is another debate. However and this is now the path towards [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2711.96s)]
*  this part of the unraveling of the type system and why was it in fact a very bumpy road. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2720.12s)]
*  What the sectarian democracies or the constitutional democracies theorists like Aaron Lipnitz said [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2727.0800000000004s)]
*  is that for this system to work properly it needs or it takes some structural conditions [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2733.7200000000003s)]
*  and he singled out several conditions. I would retain three of them. The first one has to do [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2740.84s)]
*  with the nature or the quality or the political culture of the elite of the political elites [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2746.6000000000004s)]
*  themselves that has to be that have to be these elites naturally inclined towards compromise [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2751.88s)]
*  in a constant manner. I mean they are negotiatory, they are transactional, they are and they are not [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2759.08s)]
*  in a zero-sum game let's say mindset or political culture. The second one is that the economy, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2764.44s)]
*  the political economy of such a system has to ensure a minimally acceptable level of [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2772.76s)]
*  redistribution of wealth meaning that you can't have concentration of wealth within one community [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2780.2s)]
*  to the detriment of others or within one space or one territory within the system to the detriment [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2786.52s)]
*  of others. The third condition, the third prerequisite was that the system has to evolve [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2795.16s)]
*  in a more or less peaceful regional environment so that the external tensions does not do not [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2801.64s)]
*  strain in fact the system internally. If you take these three conditions you can easily say at least [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2809.4s)]
*  for the two last the economic redistribution and the regional environment that Lebanese [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2814.84s)]
*  consociational democracy that was in fact born really on paper in 1943 was doomed to fail because [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2820.28s)]
*  in fact it was in a very tense regional environment. The Arab-Israeli conflict that started [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2827.64s)]
*  three or four years after the birth of the system and then the Arab-Arab wars and then the Cold War [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2833.08s)]
*  internationally etc etc the economic system that in fact concentrated everything on Beirut and [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2839.64s)]
*  within the sectarian system concentrated it in the hands of two or three specific [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2846.6s)]
*  sects or communities to the detriment of other or at least within these communities in the hands of [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2853.8s)]
*  a cluster of people to the detriment of others. I won't get into the story of or the history or [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2859.24s)]
*  the narration of this unraveling this is part of the chapter that I had the chance to have in this [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2866.2s)]
*  book but I would say that the agreement that ended up the civil war of 1975 which we call [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2871.8799999999997s)]
*  the Taif agreement in fact was built on two pillars and this is probably the novelty [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2880.4399999999996s)]
*  compared to the classical and traditional sectarian system sectarian political system in Lebanon. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2888.36s)]
*  It was built on two pillars. The first pillar was that in fact and I was as I was saying it transferred [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2894.84s)]
*  the quote unquote political hegemony in the political system in Lebanon from the hands of [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2902.52s)]
*  the Maronite community or the Christian communities that were in fact omnipotent before the Taif [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2909.08s)]
*  agreement but before the war it transferred this hegemony to someone else. The problem is that this [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2915.8799999999997s)]
*  someone else was a kind of very fluid couple of Sunni and Shia political forces so in fact the [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2923.08s)]
*  hegemony that was in the hands of the Maronite community was transferred and vested upon a duopol [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2931.48s)]
*  of Sunni and Shia political forces. The second pillar of the Taif agreement which is organically [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2938.3599999999997s)]
*  intertwined with this first pillar is that by a kind of international acceptance and due to [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2944.2s)]
*  the conditions of the war and the end of the war the Taif agreement gave the management and the [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2951.64s)]
*  implementation of this system to the Syrian tutelage over Lebanon meaning there was a kind [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2959.3199999999997s)]
*  of Syrian mandate over Lebanon after 1990 that was charged that was put in charge that was vested [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2964.7599999999998s)]
*  in managing this system of transferring the hegemony between Sunni and Shia and Syrians the [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2972.2s)]
*  Syrian tutelage in fact always played on these on this on this pillar or on this first pillar of [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2977.8799999999997s)]
*  of transfer of hegemony and the competition between Sunni and Shia which in fact led Lebanon to [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2985.08s)]
*  in a way join the family of the other cases in the Arab world where today you have this tension [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2991.96s)]
*  between Sunnis and Shia so in fact in a way Lebanon is a precursor in the tension of Sunni [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=2997.88s)]
*  and Shia but at the time the Sunni and Shia tension flares up after 90 of after 2010 in fact [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3004.36s)]
*  Lebanon completely joins this this family and its internal tension becomes almost unmanageable [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3011.1600000000003s)]
*  and almost problematic. Now I will end up very quickly with the last point which is in fact what [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3018.2000000000003s)]
*  are the lessons that Lebanon can tell the other the other cases in terms of sectarianism or when [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3025.32s)]
*  we talk about sectarianism I would say that the positive lessons if we can say so are the following [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3032.6000000000004s)]
*  first of all the necessity and this is something that the current events of today are telling us [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3038.84s)]
*  in a very crude and violent manner the necessity of political system to recognize sociology not to [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3044.84s)]
*  hide it not to conceal it not to deny it to accept that societies are heterogeneous but having said [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3052.36s)]
*  that not forcibly to fixate heterogeneity i.e. to inscribe it in fixed boxes in closed boxes meaning [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3059.6400000000003s)]
*  that this takes a very inventive political and institutional and constitutional engineering and [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3067.56s)]
*  this is probably the huge challenge that countries like Syria Iraq probably tomorrow Yemen Libya and [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3074.52s)]
*  etc will have to face in the coming decades this political engineering to fight the second lesson [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3080.68s)]
*  that Lebanon gives us is this famous importance of the elite nature and quality and for that of [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3087.72s)]
*  course you can say this is genetic you can't create the elite you want and etc but here also [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3095.08s)]
*  political engineering has a role and this is called democracy elections circulation of elites [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3100.2799999999997s)]
*  fluidity of systems intra-sectarian democracy because this is sometimes sometimes also we forget [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3106.84s)]
*  we tend to think about sectarian democracy as a dialogue between heads of sects as you said [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3113.1600000000003s)]
*  but sometimes we forget that this also has to do with the competition within the sects and not only [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3120.2000000000003s)]
*  among the sects and then you have other examples that Lebanon in fact gives us to tell or to [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3127.0s)]
*  to lead us to the idea that it will be kind of difficult to completely replicate the Lebanese [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3136.4399999999996s)]
*  system if for example tomorrow a solution for Syria or for Iraq has to take the shape of a tough [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3142.8399999999997s)]
*  agreement as some some people say we need a Syrian taif or we need an Iraqi taif what would be the [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3150.9199999999996s)]
*  impediments to that the first impediment is historicity these countries do not have the [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3157.08s)]
*  political culture of sectarianism there is a political culture of sectarianism any Lebanese [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3162.68s)]
*  knows how to deal with sectarianism in a more or less light manner which is not the case in countries [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3168.52s)]
*  like Syria and Iraq today the second has to do with that it has to do with a kind of political [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3175.7999999999997s)]
*  philosophy that built the Lebanese system on this famous slogan of no vanquished and no banker so in [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3182.2799999999997s)]
*  fact even after a war where very clearly someone has won the war you have this idea or this [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3189.4s)]
*  narrative that is overbuilt that in fact we all lost and we all in fact won so we can build the [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3195.2400000000002s)]
*  system again on a kind of very soft and very diluted hegemony this has to do with demography [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3201.48s)]
*  so for example in Syria where today and Haiko is saying that in the first panel where you have more [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3208.44s)]
*  or less an 80 percent Sunni society fighting against a 10 percent alawi regime more or less [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3214.52s)]
*  if the numbers are or if the figures are are correct it will be it will be very difficult in [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3221.64s)]
*  fact to build such a narrative after the war in Syria of no vanquished and no banker because there [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3227.24s)]
*  will be clearly a vanquished and a banker or at least there is today clearly a dominated and [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3232.92s)]
*  a dominant and the last point about that is exactly what Lebanon lived under the Syrian tutelage [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3239.3199999999997s)]
*  for such a system to work you need a regional architecture of regulation so the question would [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3247.56s)]
*  be for example for Syria and Iraq who will be the Syria for Syria tomorrow i.e. who will be the [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3254.2799999999997s)]
*  guarantor of civil peace tomorrow in Syria who will be the Iraq of Iraq and this is I think the [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3260.7599999999998s)]
*  open question for a region that is today in turmoil and that is probably called to stay in [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3267.0s)]
*  turmoil for years and if not for decades to come i'll stop at that point thank you very much [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3275.56s)]
*  Mark. Great thank you Joe and that the historical perspective is actually I think a very good place [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3280.52s)]
*  to to begin a discussion before going to the the audience I just wanted to ask each of you [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3285.4s)]
*  if you might just say something about the connecting back to the first panel so the [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3290.52s)]
*  subtitle of the book that we're discussing that you produced is the roots of sectarianism in a [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3296.92s)]
*  changing middle east and so we all know that there are changes in the middle east i'm curious if you [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3302.44s)]
*  see sectarianism also changing in other words is there anything new about the way sectarianism [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3307.16s)]
*  is practiced experienced or having political effects in the countries that you study or [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3313.08s)]
*  more broadly that that you might be able to share Alex? Yeah so I think in regards to my research [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3319.88s)]
*  this connects back to the idea that social media provides this platform where you have everyday [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3329.56s)]
*  citizens, elites, armed groups, extremists all interacting on the same platform and so that then [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3334.6800000000003s)]
*  changes sectarian discourse in the sense that all these groups can sort of learn from co-opt and adapt [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3342.28s)]
*  the messages in each time so I think in that sense the language of sectarianism is changing [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3349.0s)]
*  and the ability for everyday citizens to participate in the proliferation of sectarian messages I think [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3355.64s)]
*  is a new phenomenon so I think that's how I would tie it back. Justin? I think in the place of or in [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3361.4s)]
*  the case of political economy clearly the change is is the retreat of oil prices since 2014 and [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3368.44s)]
*  especially in the gulf context but not just in the gulf context the desire of states that have [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3376.36s)]
*  had this sort of social welfare system that's unsustainable to move to something else and the [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3380.92s)]
*  potential to leverage sectarianism in order to ease the transition to something else that still [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3389.32s)]
*  preserves regime security under changing economic circumstances. Alex? I mean I think everything is [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3395.7200000000003s)]
*  always changing and you know it's very easy to look at other parts of the world and think that [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3405.88s)]
*  they change slower than our own you know if you look at American society recent events seem to [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3412.76s)]
*  exposed whole new ways of understanding its makeup and I think this is a point on which I would [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3419.6400000000003s)]
*  disagree with with Joe that I don't think you can build I mean it's very difficult to build kind of [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3426.6800000000003s)]
*  governmental solutions to sectarianism out of kind of readings of a society's makeup because the [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3435.4s)]
*  society's makeup changes all the time even the things that we think that we assume must be kind [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3445.6400000000003s)]
*  of the stable core around identities that are that are built you know these kind of the religious [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3451.6400000000003s)]
*  beliefs or the religious institutions those things are changing and interacting with each other in [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3459.7200000000003s)]
*  different ways and all the time. In fact I would completely prolong what has been said for me the [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3464.68s)]
*  change and and probably what renders sectarianism is much more dangerous and much more difficult to [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3472.7599999999998s)]
*  deal with today is that it is gradually it has gradually evolved from a pure political power [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3478.12s)]
*  sharing struggle between I mean political forces that use sectarianism or sectarian language to [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3484.9199999999996s)]
*  something which is much more identity rooted much more religiously rooted and much more let's say [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3491.56s)]
*  around symbolic more than politics and you can share power but you can't share symbols for [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3499.16s)]
*  example when you talk about fighting to protect the Shia shrines in Syria or fighting for the [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3505.48s)]
*  return of the Mahdi or fighting for the murder of Ali or Hussein in the seventh century and the eighth [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3511.56s)]
*  century it's much more difficult to solve this crisis than to solve the question of who will [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3519.08s)]
*  become the Speaker of Parliament in Lebanon and how many ministers the Greek Orthodox will have [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3525.08s)]
*  and the Greek Catholics and etc. So this is to say that that I think that the the slippery slope on [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3530.2s)]
*  which sectarianism is on towards identity politics only and no more power sharing politics [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3537.72s)]
*  partly is something very difficult and it will render much more difficult to mediate [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3545.88s)]
*  transaction and negotiate solutions in the future if this trend goes on which is by the way something [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3551.7200000000003s)]
*  you can find in the Arab-Israeli conflict also which is more and more going towards a struggle [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3559.2400000000002s)]
*  over symbolism and identity much more than over territory rights interests and etc. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3564.76s)]
*  But what's interesting is that if that also applies in the Gulf where you see it perhaps [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3572.2s)]
*  I mean Justin I'm curious if you see a disentangling of these identity narratives from the kinds of [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3576.2799999999997s)]
*  political economy bargains which you see as at the center of how sectarianism operates. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3582.52s)]
*  Sure I mean to the extent that you find as in the case of Egypt which I mentioned explicitly but [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3589.16s)]
*  sort of anti-Shi'a sentiment in a place like the UAE for example where you have very small [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3593.7999999999997s)]
*  proportion of Shi'a or something that seems to be very disconnected from the political potential [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3599.16s)]
*  of that group it's much more about and part of it I think is this question that we talked more [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3607.0s)]
*  about in the first panel of outside support right so what's different is that if the potential [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3614.44s)]
*  political problems that can emanate from a domestic group is augmented sort of [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3621.16s)]
*  artificially by this outside power which may or may not exist which is Iran I mean the outside [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3625.8s)]
*  ability to manipulate that group then it doesn't matter if you have only 25 Shi'a in your country [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3630.76s)]
*  you have also Iran and they could somehow use this group to invade or something I mean so [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3636.6800000000003s)]
*  I think having this this always present intra or international competition increases the latent [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3641.5600000000004s)]
*  potential of the perceived latent potential of groups that otherwise from a strictly domestic [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3651.8799999999997s)]
*  angle don't have the potential to cause as much chaos as they're being given credit for. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3657.8799999999997s)]
*  Okay great why don't we go to the audience and see if people have questions. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3663.08s)]
*  Okay we'll wait for the microphone. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3669.56s)]
*  I'm Dr. Caroline Poplin this is this is way outside my wheelhouse but it Yemen how do these [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3671.56s)]
*  kinds of things play out in Yemen it's hard to believe it could get worse but is it going to get [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3679.56s)]
*  worse is there going to be more outside intervention is there any way we can use the different groups [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3685.96s)]
*  to stop the violence and the humanitarian crisis? [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3694.12s)]
*  Would anyone like to speak to Yemen? I mean I've lived in Yemen for a couple of years I'm [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3701.56s)]
*  definitely not a Yemen expert I would say when I spent time in Yemen in 2006 and 2000 until 2008 [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3707.32s)]
*  and I met with the Yemeni government and they said that Yemen is a very dangerous place to live [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3715.16s)]
*  until 2008 and I mentioned to people in passing that I was also working in Bahrain and working [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3721.0s)]
*  on things there and they asked well what are you working on and I said sectarian conflict [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3727.48s)]
*  and they would say oh well okay that's interesting but doesn't really have any [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3731.1600000000003s)]
*  relation here I'm like what are you talking about you have also Sunni and Shia here they're like [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3736.36s)]
*  no we don't who's where are the Shia they're they only considered the Houthis as the Shia in [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3739.6400000000003s)]
*  the country and that Zaydi's who are now being labeled as as the Shia majority or the the Shia [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3744.6800000000003s)]
*  vehicle for Iran they consider them Zaydi's which is something different than Shia so when I was in [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3749.4s)]
*  Yemen it shows sort of the how quickly this change and how people understand their own social [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3755.4s)]
*  categories can happen beyond that in terms of solutions I think one complicating issue is [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3762.52s)]
*  and maybe this is very parochial because it relates to my presentation and sort of my research [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3770.2000000000003s)]
*  interest in this case but not to be too conspiratorial but I think there is a real [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3774.76s)]
*  way in which not just Yemen but the persistence of instability in the region and particularly [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3784.1200000000003s)]
*  since it's sort of on the Arabian Peninsula gives states leverage to do things that in a time of [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3790.6000000000004s)]
*  of less security concern would be very difficult to do especially on the economic front and so I [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3799.96s)]
*  I'm not sort of suggesting that states are artificially prolonging the conflict but I think [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3806.2000000000003s)]
*  if Iran let's say were were to go away as a concern tomorrow for all the Gulf countries [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3811.8s)]
*  I don't think that would be welcomed by any of the Gulf countries except for maybe Oman [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3818.36s)]
*  I would just say that I recently had a conversation with the head of the UN humanitarian [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3822.7599999999998s)]
*  coordinator and the three things that I took away from that were he said that things in Yemen at [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3830.12s)]
*  the humanitarian level are far worse than people think they are and we all think that they're bad [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3838.28s)]
*  he said they're worse said that number two we all kind of count on Yemen having this kind of [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3842.2s)]
*  reservoir of resilience based you know it's never had a very strong state strong communities [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3847.88s)]
*  he said those reservoirs are almost entirely used up that they've been decimated by the by [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3853.4s)]
*  the blockade and especially with central banks stopping paying salaries to to [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3858.52s)]
*  to what is the public sector employment is quite high anyway and then the third is that as he [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3865.08s)]
*  put it there's no hope on the horizon which was a pretty dismal way for him to end and so [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3869.6400000000003s)]
*  yes I think things can get worse [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3876.6s)]
*  wait for the microphone [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3882.6800000000003s)]
*  I wanted to ask Joseph about about how or if you can see a possibility how to to harness [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3885.96s)]
*  potential for for non-sectarian politics in Lebanon or trans-sectarian [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3897.32s)]
*  non-sectarian and you speak about intra-sectarian democracy which is which is important but then [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3903.7999999999997s)]
*  you also have this at times quite quite sizable movement perhaps outside the former political [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3909.4s)]
*  arm who can get some some momentum and then this they dissipate again and sometimes they are [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3920.84s)]
*  they're then harnessed for the wrong cause right they're hijacked by by the sectarian elites [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3927.8s)]
*  but I mean in any place in the region I mean [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3933.08s)]
*  and think of of people establishing non-sectarian platforms I think that it's it's it's never enough [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3939.4s)]
*  you have the the level of education necessary it's sufficient and insufficient numbers [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3945.96s)]
*  numbers penetrate like reaching sufficient parts of society but you have frankly a political system [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3952.2799999999997s)]
*  that militates against that like electoral system that does not allow any kind of non-sectarian [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3959.08s)]
*  representation to be established in a sustainable manner so what to do about it I mean I mean [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3965.08s)]
*  Leiphardt is very negative about it as you know so that's I mean those those the the rebel rouses [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3971.48s)]
*  I mean those those the the rebel rouses have to be contained the wise men have to lead [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3978.52s)]
*  you know and it's more about it's more about keeping people apart and keeping people from [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3984.4399999999996s)]
*  massacre each other's that way than bringing them together so yeah um I could you know this is [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3990.04s)]
*  partly the untold the untold story in Lebanon I mean the untold history because in fact and this [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=3997.08s)]
*  is something really unjust for for for these movements we tend to forget that this is not new [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4003.8s)]
*  it's not post civil war that you have this civil society movements and etc we tend to forget that [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4008.84s)]
*  for example and this is very very interesting for political scientists at the eve of the civil war [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4015.0800000000004s)]
*  1975 meaning mainly during the the period 1970 1973 74 if you take back the statistics and the [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4020.52s)]
*  works the sociological studies that were made at that time the student moved the the non-sectarian [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4029.4s)]
*  or trans-sectarian student movement was at its height it was extremely powerful the labor union [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4035.96s)]
*  movement was extremely powerful the political parties non-sectarian were very strong you had [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4042.84s)]
*  a very strong communist party in Lebanon which is that is today anecdotal for example you had [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4050.44s)]
*  trans-sectarian or cross-sectarian housing movements and intermarriages it reached really [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4057.16s)]
*  the peak in 73 74 one year later you have one of the bloodiest sectarian civil wars in the history [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4064.7599999999998s)]
*  of humanity in fact which is a very interesting case to study it means that in fact these indicators [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4072.28s)]
*  are not enough something else has to do with political and economy a lot of people tell you [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4077.96s)]
*  but no Lebanon is not in crisis Lebanon is not heading towards catastrophe look at for example [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4083.32s)]
*  construction and look at 73 74 Beirut was over constructed also the banks were ploying under [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4088.92s)]
*  deposits and a year after you had also a civil war so I would beware about these movements per se as [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4097.400000000001s)]
*  indicators that the society is in fact not to not to minimize now the second part of the answer is [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4105.32s)]
*  first of all as you said the instrumentalization of these movements by the sectarian elite but not [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4112.52s)]
*  only by the sectarian elite by let's say some forces like for example in Lebanon by the [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4118.360000000001s)]
*  mukhabarat or etc that use them in fact to weaken sometimes the sectarian elite so in fact you you [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4126.84s)]
*  are escaping the sectarian political game but you are entering in a very bleak and very shady [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4133.160000000001s)]
*  other kind of game that is not very much nicer or very much let's say better than than the [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4138.76s)]
*  sectarian game now the third part of the answer and this is my policy answer although I hate to [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4145.400000000001s)]
*  make that in an academic setting is to say that probably instead of trying to decapsulate or to [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4151.8s)]
*  decapitate the sectarian system at the top it's to try to open small avenues and breaches in the [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4158.84s)]
*  sectarian system from the bottom from below for example like maybe struggling for a civil law of [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4166.44s)]
*  marriage for example at least optional for people to encourage housing policies that are trans [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4174.28s)]
*  sectarian or cross-sectarian or etc by mixing people geographically probably things like [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4185.4s)]
*  the Lebanese university and etc but trying today to confront the political system from the top by [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4192.2s)]
*  saying we want to change the system tomorrow we will pass to a western-styrian democracy and etc [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4198.36s)]
*  is something doomed to fail from the answer well while we have haiko here i'm actually quite [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4205.0s)]
*  curious justin you make the point about how the zaidi's become shiites and somehow the alawites [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4210.44s)]
*  became shiites but the kurds in iraq never became sunnis and i'm curious if lebanon you know you [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4215.96s)]
*  look at lebanon's experience of institutionalized confessionalism versus what we're seeing everywhere [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4222.28s)]
*  else in the region i mean what do you make of that of the ability of some groups to be turned into [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4226.84s)]
*  the sunni shia narrative and other groups seem to be immune from that kind of imposition of identity [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4235.4s)]
*  but i can give you an anecdote that that that that that that gives maybe gives an angle here so in [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4244.2s)]
*  2013 perhaps when i was still with the german think tank we had a meeting with uh with some iranian [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4256.28s)]
*  think tankers one of them was a was an intelligence person officer former apparently was instrumental [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4264.12s)]
*  in suppressing the kurdish insurrection in iran after the revolution he said very interesting [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4272.68s)]
*  something very interesting about about the alawis we had this this kind of semi-theological discussion [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4280.120000000001s)]
*  are the alawis here or not compare practice and social i mean social practice in particular [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4284.92s)]
*  in syria even today but certainly before the war with with iran and it's really very very remote [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4293.160000000001s)]
*  that there could be any any resemblance between them between syrian alawis and 12 shiaism at least [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4300.68s)]
*  as practice in iran and he said well the alawis are orphaned shia [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4307.240000000001s)]
*  i mean that's very interesting it means you have these are orphans these are people who have a [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4315.320000000001s)]
*  family that is perhaps unknown and they need another family and they have to gather in to [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4319.96s)]
*  our orbit but it's really like i mean this is something that that's that happens on the state [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4325.88s)]
*  level in this case and you you bring in you in gather a group and you claim them for yourself [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4330.84s)]
*  for strategic purposes and i think that's that's a very it's a very clear clear case and and perhaps [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4338.04s)]
*  in the process that they really alawis themselves become convinced they're here i don't know [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4344.6s)]
*  okay no just just for the second question i mean why did kurds never become sunnis i mean [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4349.8s)]
*  i mean is this i mean i think you have this this you have this case i mean you have these cases [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4355.88s)]
*  where where you have competing competing national compete competing communal projects [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4363.0s)]
*  for the kurds there is a competing narrative there is an ethno national narrative that that cuts across [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4370.52s)]
*  those those those denominational differences and look at the balcans you know look at albania [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4377.8s)]
*  for instance so across the balcans it's the former yugoslav space let's say i mean [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4384.6s)]
*  denomination and nationalism is really almost interchanging all croats are catholic [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4391.8s)]
*  and then all serbs are orthodox all muslims are muslims but then look to albania is [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4398.84s)]
*  is three denominations and actually most people i mean very few people know that it's three [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4406.92s)]
*  almost most people think albania is entirely muslim they're the national idea is simply [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4413.64s)]
*  dominant i think that this is again this historical question of the historical formation [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4419.32s)]
*  of certain communal identities and that's the case of the kurds not being seen as sunni [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4425.56s)]
*  that's fascinating um let me take a couple questions over on this side [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4430.68s)]
*  Thank you uh i'm a fellow with the young professionals of foreign policy here in dc [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4436.84s)]
*  my question is when we think about trying to de-escalate sectarianism which factor has a [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4441.72s)]
*  bigger impact is it sort of de-escalating regional tensions and that would allow domestic [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4448.28s)]
*  uh dynamics to sort of go in a different direction or is it about um sort of coming in domestically [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4452.92s)]
*  first so you know things like um in the gulf so having a different institutional [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4461.64s)]
*  setting when it comes to employment or in lebanon sort of changing uh the the way that [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4467.08s)]
*  democracy operates so is it which one i guess matters more is it coming in from de-escalating [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4473.400000000001s)]
*  regional dynamics or is it fixing the domestic institutional settings [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4479.0s)]
*  someone like to [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4483.88s)]
*  uh [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4484.52s)]
*  when you think about that we'll take another question and then we'll answer them all [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4487.64s)]
*  my name is khani so i'm a kurdish activist here in town with the american kurdish information [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4493.160000000001s)]
*  network um i was wondering if some of you could put your historian hats on um i mean europeans [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4498.280000000001s)]
*  had sectarian wars how did they address it did asians i don't know if had if they had sectarian [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4503.8s)]
*  wars did they how did they if they had it how did they address it can can the people of [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4508.84s)]
*  middle east learn from the other experiences in the world [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4514.12s)]
*  i have a question for joe actually um first congratulations for the new books um joe actually [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4523.88s)]
*  mentioned that uh uh mentioned about the institution reengineering for uh the the [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4531.64s)]
*  democracy and social justice improvement but there's one other kind of institutions that's [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4539.320000000001s)]
*  uh i'm more interested that is the economic growth and the justin actually also linked [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4546.6s)]
*  um the public opinions and the political preference with the economic growth [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4556.52s)]
*  so i don't know whether anyone can talk about it a little bit more [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4564.52s)]
*  maybe quickly in fact i'll try to tie the questions to your question i mean my my reading [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4571.24s)]
*  and this is very lebanese probably is that regional tensions are a prerequisite i mean [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4578.76s)]
*  as long as you have a feverish let's say environment it's very difficult to treat [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4585.4s)]
*  the body i mean it's first of all you have to quell this to isolate the system from regional [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4591.719999999999s)]
*  interferences very fearful competition between actors regional actors that use a sectarian [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4597.96s)]
*  language as a tool this is a prerequisite and then you have the domestic etc within which i would [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4605.16s)]
*  put not not economic growth i i don't think i ever said economic i said economic redistribution [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4611.96s)]
*  which is okay growth is good for everyone but if you have growth without distribution you haven't [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4618.04s)]
*  made anything you have growth in saudi arabia or elsewhere and i don't think that there's no [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4622.92s)]
*  sectarian problems in saudi arabia so in fact uh growth and redistribution and i said it it's [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4627.64s)]
*  not me arren clippert said it that this is one of the three prerequisites of the functioning of [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4634.4400000000005s)]
*  a constitutional democracy so yes this is a scenic one-on-condition as to say now if you allow me [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4640.52s)]
*  just a few seconds another anecdote on what you asked very interestingly after after the type [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4647.080000000001s)]
*  agreement and mainly after 2005 and the crisis in lebanon when the divide between political shiaism [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4654.280000000001s)]
*  and political sunnism became really acute and you had these christians that were torn between the [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4662.84s)]
*  two you had people in lebanon saying these are the shia christians and these are the sunni christians [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4668.92s)]
*  so in fact it's a identity is also sometimes like that so you have our lists were the shia christians [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4674.28s)]
*  and people from jaja were the sunni christians so you have this this joke in lebanon which is [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4680.36s)]
*  not only a joke i think which is politically something relevant or something interesting to [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4685.72s)]
*  use to explain something a great article right there justin uh i think on this question of [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4690.76s)]
*  domestic versus international prerequisites maybe mark has a different reading but i think in [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4696.92s)]
*  political science at least there's been some work including recent work in the middle east that [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4703.32s)]
*  seems to suggest that in times when you have less space for domestic political activity so [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4708.76s)]
*  sort of more closed environment maybe crackdowns and that sort of thing that people that naturally [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4717.400000000001s)]
*  magnifies the importance of international sort of transnational identities because of course local [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4724.28s)]
*  political identity is then sort of a moot point because there's no space for political actives [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4728.36s)]
*  and lawrence louis wrote a good book on this in the gulf context on transnational shiaism [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4733.8s)]
*  and so i think it's it's not necessarily the case that at least in my experience in the gulf that [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4739.16s)]
*  intern cooling international tensions is a is a sort of pre-wack prerequisite for domestic [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4745.88s)]
*  um reconciliation on the other hand um i think another important question is whether or not [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4752.44s)]
*  states feel so ruling elites feel it's in their interest to have this sort of domestic reconciliation [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4760.2s)]
*  if you think about the uprising in bahrain for example in 2011 um the first political party to [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4767.64s)]
*  be dissolved after that shale led uprising was the secular political society why because the only [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4773.88s)]
*  the only real threat to a regime like bahrain or other minority ruled regimes is if basically [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4780.68s)]
*  people start to organize on the basis of just regular class or political grievances like i [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4788.360000000001s)]
*  don't like um corruption or i don't like the fact the state is just naturalizing random people to [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4794.68s)]
*  serve in the military and the police but um so that's dangerous from the state if that starts [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4801.400000000001s)]
*  happening but if people start protesting because i'm a shia and i don't like the state then that's [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4807.16s)]
*  easy to combat because then all you have to do is say hey somebody's look at all these shia [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4810.84s)]
*  protesting maybe you should do something about that right that's a very easy [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4814.2s)]
*  situation to handle from the standpoint of the state so it's not a coincidence that these secular [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4818.5199999999995s)]
*  political societies and sec cross um sectarian mobilization has emerged hasn't emerged and [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4823.24s)]
*  you know people in bahrain came up with stickers for example that they would put on their um [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4829.0s)]
*  coats that said not sonny not she just bahraini and people would rip them off at security [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4835.24s)]
*  checkpoints they would say they would use that as a sign of opposition because they're they're [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4841.0s)]
*  daring to challenge the sectarian and narrative of the state which ties back into what the question [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4845.4s)]
*  i raised in the presentation which is how can you if the state is is proactively promoting a sectarian [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4850.5199999999995s)]
*  narrative then if you agree with that narrative then are you just a sort of supporter of the [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4856.759999999999s)]
*  state and that's all you are is it a political act or is it fundamentally a sectarian act and [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4861.48s)]
*  i think it's not always clear when the boundary between those things alex or alex um yeah i mean [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4866.919999999999s)]
*  i think not to harp too much on the media environment but that really ties into this [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4874.5199999999995s)]
*  discussion of transnational versus more domestic sectarian issues because now you have a space where [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4879.799999999999s)]
*  everyday citizens in countries across the region are exposed not just to what's going on in their [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4886.68s)]
*  own political system and domestic political elites interpretations of conflicts abroad that you can [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4891.88s)]
*  they can also view content that's being produced by people on the ground in other places in real [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4897.88s)]
*  time and so distinguishing between domestic and transnational becomes more complicated because it's [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4905.0s)]
*  not just about the elite narratives anymore it's also these sort of mass narratives that transcend [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4910.44s)]
*  transnational boundaries in a new way last word can as well yeah i mean it's such an interesting [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4916.5199999999995s)]
*  question from somewhere um i mean i think it doesn't this doesn't always have to come down to [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4922.5199999999995s)]
*  conflict and where conflict is happening or originating but these uh you know the the kinds [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4929.48s)]
*  of identities and the way that people are drawing boundaries are shifting even in peace time [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4936.6s)]
*  and in ways that i think always kind of belie national borders but also communal borders [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4944.76s)]
*  i mean going back to my clerics in lebanon you know we um the appointment of [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4951.64s)]
*  uh sunni muftis in lebanon has always been done partly by lebanese sunnis but also partly by [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4959.0s)]
*  lebanese christians and syrians and egyptians and they've all been involved in that process [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4967.24s)]
*  and uh and i think you know as alex is saying as well you know you can't really [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4974.44s)]
*  these things are never happening completely separately [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4982.2s)]
*  all right well i think we're just about out of time i'd like to thank you all for coming i'd like [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBS5eWGvT0&t=4985.24s)]
