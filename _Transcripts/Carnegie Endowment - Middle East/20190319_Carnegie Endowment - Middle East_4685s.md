*  of the Middle East, and Turkish politics. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=100.88s)]
*  I'll turn for to Sharon to start us off. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=102.44s)]
*  Great. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=105.44s)]
*  Thank you, Sarah, and thank you everyone for coming. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=106.44s)]
*  I'm going to talk about Tunisia, which was the subject of my country report. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=108.08000000000001s)]
*  So we did a survey of 800 Tunisians in 2017 to try to figure out who do Tunisians think [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=112.92s)]
*  is the most popular religious authority, who do they trust to speak for Islam. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=120.28s)]
*  So we asked Tunisians about 13 religious figures from state authorities, like the Grand Mufti [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=125.52s)]
*  and the Grand Imam of Zaituna Mosque, to mainstream Islamists, figures associated with Anatha, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=132.08s)]
*  to Salafis, to Jihadists, to Sufis. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=138.0s)]
*  And we asked in a couple different ways to try to get at who is the most trusted as a [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=143.28s)]
*  religious authority. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=149.44s)]
*  We asked two direct questions. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=150.44s)]
*  So of these 13 figures, which do you approve of? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=152.84s)]
*  Of these 13, how much do you trust them as a religious authority? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=157.64s)]
*  And so in those direct questions, as you might expect, there is very low support for [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=161.96s)]
*  the Salafi or Jihadi figures, some of the more extreme figures. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=168.08s)]
*  Now it could be that people, that there is genuinely low trust or support for these figures, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=172.24s)]
*  but it could also be that people are not willing to state that they support Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=178.72s)]
*  the leader of the Islamic State, for instance. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=183.52s)]
*  So what we also did in the survey was to implement some endorsement experiments. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=186.28s)]
*  Now there are some new faces in the room, so let me briefly explain what an endorsement [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=191.88s)]
*  experiment is. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=195.68s)]
*  Basically we try to indirectly measure how much support there is for Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=198.44s)]
*  for instance. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=203.96s)]
*  So rather than directly ask, do you trust him, we associate his name with a statement, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=204.96s)]
*  and we see, does your support for that statement increase when his name is associated with [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=210.28s)]
*  it? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=215.04s)]
*  So for instance, if we divided up the room into two groups and we asked this side of [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=216.04s)]
*  the room just the statement, for instance, how much do you agree that democracy and Islam [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  are incompatible? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=226.6s)]
*  And so let's say on this side of the room it was about, your level of agreement was [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=228.76s)]
*  about three on the one to five point scale. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  And then we asked this side of the room the same question, but with Baghdadi's name. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  So how much do you agree with this statement by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=240.79999999999998s)]
*  And so the statement is the same, and so given that this group was randomly chosen and so [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=245.27999999999997s)]
*  should be similar to that group, we would expect there to be the same level of support [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=250.6s)]
*  for that statement. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=254.51999999999998s)]
*  But now that statement is associated with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=255.79999999999998s)]
*  And so if you have negative feelings towards him, your support for that statement should [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=260.08s)]
*  be less. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=263.64s)]
*  And if you have positive associations with him, your support for that statement should [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=264.64s)]
*  be higher. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=268.71999999999997s)]
*  So with this endorsement experiment, we can back out this indirect effect of his endorsement. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=269.71999999999997s)]
*  So for instance, if support for this statement is three point five now instead of three, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=275.71999999999997s)]
*  that would suggest there's some positive association with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's name. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=281.08s)]
*  So that's the endorsement experiment. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=286.03999999999996s)]
*  So with these methods, both the direct questions and this indirect question, what did we find [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=288.65999999999997s)]
*  in Tunisia? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=293.88s)]
*  We had three main findings. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=295.28s)]
*  The first is about Anath. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=298.35999999999996s)]
*  So Anath is very powerful politically as a political party, but what we found is that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=300.7s)]
*  it was not seen generally as a religious authority. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=306.97999999999996s)]
*  So we asked about two figures from Anath. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=311.5s)]
*  We asked about the head of Anath, Sheikh Rashid Ghanoushi, as well as one of their more conservative [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=314.59999999999997s)]
*  or religious members, Sheikh Habib Alouz, who is now more involved in their preaching and [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=322.3s)]
*  proselytizing and not involved in the political sides of Anath. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=327.71999999999997s)]
*  So Anath, as you know, is the mainstream Islamist party in Tunisia. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=332.7s)]
*  It has been around since the 80s, was largely repressed under the former regime of Ben Ali. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=337.15999999999997s)]
*  But now after the Arab Spring, it's one of the strongest political parties. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=342.82s)]
*  It won in 2011, came second in 2014, was the top party in the municipal elections last [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=347.34s)]
*  year and is likely to do very well this coming fall in the elections. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=353.52000000000004s)]
*  So Anath politically is very powerful, and so we would expect that perhaps it is also [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=357.72s)]
*  popular in terms of religious matters. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=362.72s)]
*  What we find is that that's not the case. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=365.96000000000004s)]
*  So both Ghanoushi, the head of Anath, and Habib Alouz, which kind of represents the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=368.04s)]
*  more religious wing of Anath, neither of them were trusted as a religious authority. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=372.92s)]
*  So we asked them on a one to five point scale, how much do you trust these figures as a religious [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=378.92s)]
*  authority? They both came in very low, one point seven and one point eight out of five. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=382.84s)]
*  So they were not trusted as as religious authorities. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=388.52s)]
*  Similarly, in the endorsement experiments, when Ghanoushi or Habib Alouz's names were [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=392.28s)]
*  associated with a statement, support for that statement decreased, suggesting that [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=397.84s)]
*  overall there's negative feelings towards Ghanoushi and Habib Alouz. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=403.32s)]
*  Perhaps among a segment of Tunisians, there is support for them. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=409.12s)]
*  But overall, this suggests that on average they have a negative effect when their name [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=412.4s)]
*  is associated with a statement. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=416.71999999999997s)]
*  So that is somewhat surprising if you think of Anath performing so well politically, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=419.12s)]
*  but then perhaps is not seen as a religious authority. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=424.71999999999997s)]
*  Now, we only have one snapshot in time, which was in December 2017. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=427.84s)]
*  We don't we haven't done this survey before. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=432.36s)]
*  So we cannot say that their religious, Anath's religious authority has declined per se, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=434.44s)]
*  since we only have this one snapshot in time. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=440.12s)]
*  But qualitatively, I think we can come to the conclusion that their religious authority [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=443.64s)]
*  has declined over time and for a couple of reasons. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=449.2s)]
*  After the Arab Spring, once they were the the head of the government and drafting the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=452.44s)]
*  new constitution, they made many compromises on issues of religion. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=458.59999999999997s)]
*  For instance, they agreed not to put Sharia into the constitution as the basis of [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=463.28000000000003s)]
*  legislation. They accepted gender equality to enshrine that in the constitution. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=467.40000000000003s)]
*  They accepted freedom of conscience, not just freedom of religion, but conscious, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=473.56s)]
*  allowing atheists as well into the constitution. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=477.04s)]
*  So they made these compromises on religion, which may have hurt their religious [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=480.52000000000004s)]
*  credibility among their base, especially among the more hardliners among their base. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=485.56s)]
*  And so that may have contributed to this decline in religious authority. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=491.08000000000004s)]
*  But in addition, in 2016, Anatha formally specialized into politics, separating off [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=494.88s)]
*  its preaching and proselytizing and charitable activities. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=501.20000000000005s)]
*  And in that process of separating or specializing into politics, they announced [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=505.56s)]
*  that they no longer wanted to be considered Islamists and now wanted to be considered [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=512.16s)]
*  Muslim Democrats. They no longer wanted any conflation of religion and politics. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=515.88s)]
*  And so that separation as well, distancing themselves from religion may also have [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=520.84s)]
*  contributed to this decline in religious authority for Anatha. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=525.76s)]
*  So that's surprising finding. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=531.2s)]
*  Number one, that Anatha is not seen as a religious authority. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=532.72s)]
*  The second finding that the state authorities, the state religious authorities [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=537.08s)]
*  in Tunisia are surprisingly popular, both the Grand Mufti of Manbatif and the former [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=541.1600000000001s)]
*  Grand Imam of Zaituna Mosque, Hisham Obadi. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=547.2s)]
*  Both of them were surprisingly popular, both when you ask directly, how much do you [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=550.84s)]
*  trust them as a religious authority and when you use these indirect endorsement [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=555.48s)]
*  experiments, when these state religious authorities, when their names are associated [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=559.8000000000001s)]
*  with a statement, support for that statement increases and significantly so. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=563.72s)]
*  So that suggests that these state religious authorities are considered authorities, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=568.9200000000001s)]
*  which is also surprising because these state religious authorities are generally seen as [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=576.24s)]
*  co-opted by the state. For instance, the Grand Mufti of Manbatif, he at first opposed [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=581.16s)]
*  equal inheritance publicly in 2016 when it was proposed by an independent member of [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=589.84s)]
*  parliament. But then when President Assebsi proposed equal inheritance, he came out in [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=596.28s)]
*  favor of it. And so very clearly he is taking the state line. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=600.8399999999999s)]
*  And so normally we would think that because he is so tied to the state or co-opted by [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=605.0s)]
*  the state that he wouldn't be popular. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=609.0799999999999s)]
*  But surprisingly, our data suggest otherwise that these state authorities are surprisingly [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=610.8s)]
*  popular. So that was finding number two, which echoes findings from elsewhere, from [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=615.3199999999999s)]
*  Jordan and Morocco and elsewhere in the region, as Kadir mentioned earlier. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=619.9599999999999s)]
*  And the final somewhat surprising finding was that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was quite popular [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=623.88s)]
*  in Tunisia, not when you ask directly. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=632.2800000000001s)]
*  Remember, if you ask directly, who do you approve of a trust as an authority? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=634.6800000000001s)]
*  Very few people say Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=638.2s)]
*  But in the endorsement experiments where we associated his name with a statement, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=640.48s)]
*  there we saw huge support for Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, that support for a statement on [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=644.64s)]
*  average increased by point five point half of a point on the one to five point scale, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=649.2s)]
*  more than any other figure when their name was associated with it. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=655.2s)]
*  So that was normatively troubling. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=658.5600000000001s)]
*  But in some ways corroborates the fact that Tunisia has sent the highest number of [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=662.1600000000001s)]
*  foreign fighters per capita to fight in Syria and Iraq for ISIS. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=666.24s)]
*  So in that sense, it corroborates. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=670.88s)]
*  It has some external validity. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=673.2s)]
*  And in addition, what we find elsewhere in the survey is that Baghdadi also does well [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=674.9200000000001s)]
*  in Morocco and Jordan to other countries that have sent a number of foreign fighters [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=678.56s)]
*  as well. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=682.3599999999999s)]
*  On the end, this would also validate the assumption that the reason Tunisia sends [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=685.04s)]
*  so many foreign fighters is not because, you know, it's a democracy now and therefore [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=690.1199999999999s)]
*  it's easier to travel or that those governments at the time were encouraging foreign [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=694.28s)]
*  fighters, but rather it validates the assumption that there is also genuine support [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=698.16s)]
*  for Baghdadi, which is why Tunisia is sending the foreign fighters. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=701.8399999999999s)]
*  It's not because of easier ability to travel, for instance. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=704.64s)]
*  On the other hand, there is one bright spot or silver lining to this finding, which is [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=708.88s)]
*  that the Salafi jihadi groups that operate within Tunisia itself. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=714.7199999999999s)]
*  So we asked, for instance, about the head of Ansar al-Sharia, Abu Ayad, as well as one [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=719.76s)]
*  Salafi sheikh, Khatib al-Adrisi, who is seen also as helping recruit for extremist groups [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=725.1199999999999s)]
*  domestically. Both of them had the lowest approval of any of the figures in the Tunisian [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=730.88s)]
*  survey. So that suggests that these domestic Salafi or jihadi groups don't have any [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=736.68s)]
*  support among Tunisians, both in the direct questions and among these indirect endorsement [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=744.68s)]
*  experiments. So the silver lining then is that while Tunisians appear to support foreign [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=749.9599999999999s)]
*  fighters abroad, they don't appear to support violence or extremist ideologies at home. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=755.56s)]
*  And so that, at least, is a silver lining to those findings on Salafi jihadis. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=761.0799999999999s)]
*  So finally, let me conclude with one perhaps analytical conclusion from these and then one [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=766.2s)]
*  more policy implication. So the analytical conclusion would be that if we view these [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=771.8000000000001s)]
*  different religious actors as competing with each other for religious authority, then it [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=778.12s)]
*  somewhat makes sense that we see support for the extremes, the state authorities on the [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=784.2800000000001s)]
*  liberal side and the Salafi jihadis, the Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on the other, as a result of the [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=789.8s)]
*  middle, Anakhta, perhaps the middle of the spectrum, being delegitimized. So as Anakhta [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=795.4s)]
*  doesn't have religious authority, perhaps that increases support for the extremes. So that would [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=800.68s)]
*  be one conclusion we may be able to draw if we take this assumption that these different religious [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=805.88s)]
*  actors are competing with each other on a spectrum. And that would then help us to explain how Tunisia [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=810.8399999999999s)]
*  can, on the one hand, lead the region on women's rights and then, on the other hand, send the [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=818.2s)]
*  highest number of foreign fighters per capita because there's support for both of the extremes [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=822.76s)]
*  rather than the moderate middle. Let me then also make one policy implication, which is that, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=827.24s)]
*  of course, these findings on Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi are very surprising. And so they would suggest [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=836.36s)]
*  that Tunisia still has much work to do in terms of preventing and countering violent extremism. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=840.9200000000001s)]
*  And so the policy recommendation, of course, would be to invest more and double down in your [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=846.44s)]
*  investment into these P and CVE strategies. But perhaps one takeaway, not only of the Tunisia [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=850.36s)]
*  case but of these reports more generally, is that state religious authorities, given that they are [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=858.5200000000001s)]
*  so popular, may be able to play a role as well in countering violent extremism and providing a [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=863.96s)]
*  counter narrative that may have some credibility, surprisingly, to counter ISIS narratives, for [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=869.88s)]
*  instance. And so both the Grand Mufti but also the local amams that are trained by the Ministry of [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=877.56s)]
*  Religious Affairs may be able to have some weight in providing a counter narrative. But, of course, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=882.28s)]
*  let me caution us also based on, for instance, what Scott had said in the previous panel, that [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=887.48s)]
*  involving these state religious authorities too politically, so for instance, meeting directly [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=893.4000000000001s)]
*  with the U.S. embassy, if a religious figure meets directly with the U.S. embassy, it undermines [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=899.72s)]
*  their religious legitimacy. But also if they are seen as too political domestically, so for instance, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=905.5600000000001s)]
*  if they're seen as openly supporting the government or even openly criticizing the government, it also [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=911.48s)]
*  undermined their religious authority. And so to underscore what Kadir said in the opening that [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=916.44s)]
*  empowering the state authorities has to be done delicately, that if they're going to play a role [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=922.28s)]
*  on CVE, it must be done and must be seen as an organic initiative on their part as opposed to [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=926.4399999999999s)]
*  something imposed by the U.S. or by the state. Thank you very much. Okay, great. I'd also like [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=932.6s)]
*  to thank very much to the Baker Institute as well as Carnegie for the invitation to speak here today. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=940.6s)]
*  And I'm speaking about the Iran part of the survey, which I just have to point out is a little bit [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=946.84s)]
*  different in some ways from the survey on the other countries. First of all, it's much larger. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=952.2s)]
*  It's an N of more than 2,000 respondents, so that's really fantastic that we have such a large survey. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=956.12s)]
*  I should also mention that there's never been a survey done of this kind since the founding of [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=963.4s)]
*  the Islamic Republic. It's incredibly difficult to ask about support for religious leaders. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=967.72s)]
*  It's politically very touchy, and the fact that we've been able to ask these questions [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=972.92s)]
*  by sort of implicitly gouging support through the endorsement experiment, you have heard a lot about [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=978.28s)]
*  it already, has really been a wonderful opportunity. And so I think the results of the survey will [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=983.4s)]
*  make us Iran's followers sort of rethink some of our conceptions of religious authority in Iran if [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=991.4s)]
*  we trust the results, because it upsets some of the dominant literature, including the Islamic [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=997.0799999999999s)]
*  literature, including some of my own writings, which is unfortunate, but I have to deal with it. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1001.88s)]
*  So it's a much higher N, and it's also a survey that was conducted nearly a year later. So [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1008.92s)]
*  we just got most of the individual level data two weeks ago, and the survey itself was conducted [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1013.56s)]
*  in December 2018 in most of the other countries a year earlier. Of course, the context of Iran is [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1018.4399999999999s)]
*  also quite different, not only because it's a Shiite context, but also because it's a highly [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1025.16s)]
*  state dominated context. We have, of course, a similar situation in Saudi Arabia, but I would [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1030.2s)]
*  say in Iran, the state intrusion in questions of religious authority and religious training [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1034.8400000000001s)]
*  and religious certification is even on a higher level and is more systematic. And here I just [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1040.3600000000001s)]
*  would have to point out that some of these issues are inherent to what it means to follow a Shiite [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1045.96s)]
*  leader, and some of these issues are inherent to the way the state has organized the religious [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1052.76s)]
*  feud in Iran. So let me just elaborate briefly on these two issues. As you may or may not know, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1057.48s)]
*  as a Shiite believer, you should follow a source of emulation, right? You should choose a marja, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1063.88s)]
*  and it has to be a living marja, whose religious injunctions you follow. So you have to, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1068.3600000000001s)]
*  if in doubt, you should study the fatwas of this religious leader that you've chosen, and it always [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1073.64s)]
*  has to be somebody who's at the very, very top of the Shiite religious hierarchy. You choose the [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1077.96s)]
*  fatwas of this particular person, and you should follow this leader really across all areas. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1083.48s)]
*  In most areas, believers won't ask themselves what a fatwa is on a particular issue of a leader, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1089.56s)]
*  but for example, with regard to family law, these issues are often quite prevalent. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1095.24s)]
*  Are you allowed to engage in in vitro fertilization? What are the inheritance rights in case of [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1100.1200000000001s)]
*  adoption? All sorts of issues. Surrogacy. There are now a number of biomedical issues that are [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1104.28s)]
*  current, and on these affairs, a believer would have to look, for example, at the fatwa collection [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1111.32s)]
*  of ramenei. Ramenei is a source of emulation chosen, or of sestani in Iraq, if that is a [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1116.4399999999998s)]
*  source of emulation chosen, and a believer should follow these injunctions. In addition, if you are [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1121.32s)]
*  a trader, if you are in a private business, you should also donate one-fifth of your profit to [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1127.8799999999999s)]
*  that religious leader, from which he will then again finance social institutions, hospitals, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1133.64s)]
*  orphanages, as well as Shiite seminaries. There's a political economy to who you choose, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1141.0800000000002s)]
*  and there's really a binding relationship, because you should theoretically follow the fatwas of this [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1147.0s)]
*  leader in all issues, and you shouldn't pick and choose. Now, that also means that some of the [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1152.68s)]
*  individuals we asked about are not compliments, but are substitutes, right? So if you're asked [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1160.52s)]
*  about ramenei and sestani, you can really only choose one, whereas in some of the other contexts [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1166.84s)]
*  that we had, you could find two leaders trustworthy, and you could follow a leader and read his [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1170.76s)]
*  writings on some issues, but follow another on other issues, and that theoretically shouldn't [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1176.68s)]
*  really be possible if you're an orthodox 12-ashii'ite believer. So these two dimensions make the Iranian [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1180.12s)]
*  context a little bit different. I should also just mention that with regard to the extent of [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1188.68s)]
*  the state domination of the religious field, there are two dimensions to this. One is the fact that [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1193.5600000000002s)]
*  a state-dominated council in Rome keeps a list of people who are officially recognized as ayatollahs, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1202.68s)]
*  as grand ayatollahs, as hojatollahs, so the hierarchy is if you have sort of achieved [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1209.3200000000002s)]
*  something equivalent to a doctorate in shia law, you become a hojatollah Islam, you're [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1215.64s)]
*  allowed to engage in ijtihad, which means then you're also allowed to issue fatwas, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1220.92s)]
*  and you can then rise to become an ayatollah and a grand ayatollah, and eventually you can [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1225.0s)]
*  become to rise a source of emulation or marja. So where somebody stands on this list traditionally [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1229.3200000000002s)]
*  was affected by first of all how many believers one would be able to gather, which is a matter [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1238.92s)]
*  of charisma and popularity, and secondly the extent to which colleagues would recognize one [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1244.76s)]
*  as a religious authority. However, since the state has really prompted the authority of this [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1249.56s)]
*  home-based institution that keeps an official list, the natural or the traditional way of certifying [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1257.0s)]
*  and rising in the hierarchy has been upset a little bit, right? So one has to keep that in mind that [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1263.4s)]
*  believers may be impacted in their choice by where somebody is on the official list, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1268.44s)]
*  and you can be demoted if you're politically critical for example. The second issue is that [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1272.92s)]
*  especially under Khomeini, so the successor of Khomeini who became supreme leader in 1989, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1280.04s)]
*  a process has set in where the state has very systematically and very comprehensively [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1285.0800000000002s)]
*  aimed to incorporate the religious seminaries into the state sphere up to a point where the [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1289.8000000000002s)]
*  state now decides what are the issues that are being taught, how are the curricula put together, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1294.68s)]
*  who is hired as teaching personnel, who is even allowed to apply and then be admitted to which [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1300.44s)]
*  religious seminaries, how high the stipends are. All of these issues used to be decentralized [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1306.92s)]
*  and used to be decided by the individual leader of a religious seminary, the Mutawali. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1312.2s)]
*  So the situation today is very different where the religious seminaries are state-dominated [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1318.1200000000001s)]
*  to extent that has never been the case in the Iranian context. One has to really be aware of [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1321.88s)]
*  that it is under an Islamic republic that the religious landscape is more state-dominated than [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1325.24s)]
*  it ever has been before. Okay, so turning to the survey, just to give you some figures in terms of [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1330.52s)]
*  representativeness, 37 percent female, so slightly fewer than the census would suggest. Also our [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1337.4s)]
*  sample is slightly less educated, 39 percent have a BA degree, 50 percent an MA degree, 2 percent have [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1346.44s)]
*  a PhD degree. Unemployed 50 percent, so a slightly less educated and slightly more unemployed sample [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1354.12s)]
*  than would be a representative. It is representative with regard to levels of religiosity if we believe [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1363.1599999999999s)]
*  the world value survey, so that's really the other one survey that we can trust with regard to [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1369.0s)]
*  how much religion plays a role in people's lives, how religious people are. The world value service [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1373.2399999999998s)]
*  has it at 66 percent, you know, religion is very important in my life and our survey has it at 63 [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1378.12s)]
*  percent, so very similar figures. Only about 20 percent read the Quran daily, but that also gels [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1382.92s)]
*  with the general impression that we have in terms of religiosity. And then 66 percent are in favor of [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1388.28s)]
*  clerical influence, which is also again something about two-thirds that is similar to what the [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1395.0800000000002s)]
*  world value survey indicates, and 40 percent indicate that they are pro-democracy, which is [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1400.76s)]
*  something very difficult to gauge. We have a number of surveys, but I would not venture to sort of [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1404.92s)]
*  want to interpret what it really means in this context to be pro-democracy. So we asked about [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1413.0s)]
*  15 religious figures in Iran, nine Iranian and six foreign, which is already quite extraordinary [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1417.8000000000002s)]
*  because there is a strong tendency within Iran to follow only Iranian figures and if not Iranian, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1423.8000000000002s)]
*  then surely Shiite figures of course, but we have 10 Shiite figures and five Sunni figures that we [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1428.76s)]
*  included. Significantly among the Shiite figures, so the 10, there are only six clerical, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1435.0s)]
*  and four are rather religious intellectuals. So you have to think of the six clerical ones [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1442.6000000000001s)]
*  as substitutes. Again, you can only follow Mesbah Yasti or Khamenei or Wahid Khorasani, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1449.8000000000002s)]
*  but you could follow at the same time or you could find trustworthy some of the religious [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1456.44s)]
*  intellectuals. So those are rather complements and substitutes. And interestingly, what I [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1461.96s)]
*  didn't mention is you should theoretically of course follow always only a living marja, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1466.5200000000002s)]
*  so you cannot really follow Khomeini anymore, but nevertheless Khomeini was included in the survey [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1471.16s)]
*  and he does in one instance where people are likely to have had the marja question in the back of their [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1475.8000000000002s)]
*  mind. He's coming up at the top figure, so that is a really, really interesting finding and I [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1480.2s)]
*  will come to that in a moment. So I'll just walk you quickly through three slides. In terms of, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1484.3600000000001s)]
*  so we have levels of approval, levels of trust and then the endorsement experiment, which has [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1489.8000000000002s)]
*  this more indirect question gouging of support for religious figures. So what's surprising in [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1493.64s)]
*  terms of level of approval is that in the top eight ranks not all are Iranian. There's also [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1499.56s)]
*  Sistani, which is not surprising, but there's also Nasrallah, the leader of his Bola. And that's [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1504.6799999999998s)]
*  really something that one wouldn't have expected because he's not highly trained, he's not considered [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1508.9199999999998s)]
*  a high ranking religious figures and he's not Iranian and he's really more of a political [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1514.28s)]
*  than a theological leader. What's also surprising is that among the top eight not all are clerical. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1519.3999999999999s)]
*  So we actually have in rank three and four Shariati, a sociologist who died before the [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1525.0s)]
*  revolution in 1977, who's still very popular, who's considered to be sort of a representative [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1531.32s)]
*  of the Islamic left, somebody who argued for a merging of Islamic ideology and Marxism and [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1537.56s)]
*  who is still invoked today as sort of a strong proponent of welfare policies, redistribution, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1543.96s)]
*  really the representative of the Islamic leftist ideologies, which I think explains most of his [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1549.64s)]
*  high performance on these charts. So he always comes up as a third or fourth most popular figure, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1557.16s)]
*  which is quite surprising. And right next to him is Romshiai, who is a scholar of literature and [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1562.28s)]
*  mysticism. He's the most popular scholar on Iranian TV, runs a number of TV programs, but he really is [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1568.2s)]
*  not a religious leader and he's not clerically trained. So it shows sort of the attractiveness [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1575.0s)]
*  of thinking about religion beyond the state sphere and beyond the official authority sphere. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1582.76s)]
*  Just think about mysticism and sort of plays on the invocations of the very, very important [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1587.8s)]
*  Iranian literary figures who are often invoked in terms of wise statements and so on and about [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1600.28s)]
*  whom also a number of sermons both by clerical and non-clerical figures focus. Then we have [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1605.96s)]
*  also a surprising finding in the top six figures, only two status figures, and I will come back to [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1613.56s)]
*  that. And this reformist figures rank surprisingly low. So we have one clerical reformist, Aytol [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1618.52s)]
*  Sani, who actually was officially demoted. He shouldn't be, and he is not by the official [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1625.0800000000002s)]
*  newspapers referred to as a Grand Ayatollah anymore because he supported the Green Movement [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1629.24s)]
*  in 2009 and heavily criticized the regime for its very weak human rights record. He actually figures [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1634.6000000000001s)]
*  quite low. So in terms of levels of approval, he's only in rank nine. As you can see from the charts, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1641.72s)]
*  there have been handouts. They're also outside. And Sourouj, the religious intellectuals, who [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1647.64s)]
*  have sort of been very much identified with a vision of Iran as a religious country but no [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1652.28s)]
*  longer a clerically dominated polity, also ranks very low only on place 10. So it makes one think [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1659.56s)]
*  to see that the reformist figures rank relatively low. Just one final thing I want to point out on [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1666.8400000000001s)]
*  this first chart is that the nones, so who do you trust level of approval, none ranks just as high [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1673.48s)]
*  as the bottom six figures. So that could also be interpreted as a protest vote. It's a very [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1681.16s)]
*  interesting finding. Now moving to level of trust, and I think it is here that a believer would most [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1686.52s)]
*  likely have in mind who would you choose as a marja because you can approve of somebody and [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1691.72s)]
*  we actually see that the Sunni figures don't do too badly. Al-Tayyab, the Imam of al-Asad, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1695.5600000000002s)]
*  does surprisingly well. So that might be because people approve of him. He is a well-trained [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1700.76s)]
*  religious figure, but trust is something that I think people might associate with a choice for [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1705.56s)]
*  the Marja'i. Who do you choose as a source of emulation? And here again, surprisingly, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1711.96s)]
*  among the top 10 figures we actually have two Sunni figures. So you could interpret this as a [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1717.1599999999999s)]
*  protest or as a turning away from status religious authority, and we actually only have among the top [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1722.6s)]
*  10 figures are five Shiite clerics. So that really makes one think if who enjoys your highest level [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1728.84s)]
*  of trust among the top 10 only five Shiite clerics come out, then that shows a lot of support for [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1736.36s)]
*  notions of religious authority beyond the state and beyond the clerical field. Again, the reformist [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1742.44s)]
*  figures come out very low, Sunni, and Sourouj in the bottom third, and as I indicated earlier, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1747.64s)]
*  most surprisingly in terms of this chart, Khomeini comes out on top, even though you shouldn't be [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1756.6s)]
*  able to choose Khomeini as a Marja'i anymore today because you cannot follow a deceased Marja'. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1761.48s)]
*  Now moving to the endorsement question, and then I will come to the conclusions. The endorsement [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1767.8799999999999s)]
*  effects I think have been across the whole country surveyed really the most surprising findings. In [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1775.08s)]
*  Iran, we have to say that overall the endorsement effects are lower, are weaker than in the other [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1780.9199999999998s)]
*  countries, and where they do matter they are predominantly negative, which is also interesting. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1785.8s)]
*  Khomeini is actually the only one who where the association of a statement with his name [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1792.28s)]
*  makes it more likely that a believer will approve of that statement. So Khomeini is the only one who [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1798.36s)]
*  has a positive endorsement effect. Then there are three figures Khomeini, Sistani, Shariati, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1803.08s)]
*  where the naming, the mentioning of their names doesn't really seem to impact the perception of [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1808.44s)]
*  the statement at all. And then the other six figures all are negatively, have a negative impact [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1812.44s)]
*  on whether a person would approve a statement associated with their name. So that is quite [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1817.72s)]
*  thought-provoking. And again the reformist figures Soudouj and Sana'i here have very negative [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1822.44s)]
*  effects, nearly as negative as the two Sunnis who are included in this list, Qaradawi and Erdogan. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1828.52s)]
*  That really turns the literature on religious authority and approval of it in the Iranian [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1835.4s)]
*  context on its head. Now to move to some preliminary conclusions. First of all just five [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1839.96s)]
*  quick points. So overall we see actually a lack of strong support for status figures other than [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1846.76s)]
*  the supreme leader. So Khomeini and Khomeini always come out on top, but beyond them Bahit Khorasani, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1852.68s)]
*  Mesbah Yazdi, others that we included really range in the middle field or the bottom third, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1860.28s)]
*  and that's quite interesting. So it does show that to some extent the very very strong apparatus [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1865.4s)]
*  that is put in place to regulate the religious sphere and to really influence curricula and what [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1872.0400000000002s)]
*  is taught and who's teaching and who are the most important figures, what is being distributed on [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1876.2800000000002s)]
*  the market, who is being censored, who is not, that that really has only a moderate impact. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1879.8000000000002s)]
*  So there's a lot of support for figures beyond the status sphere. Believers remain independent [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1886.6000000000001s)]
*  in their choice. That's really a major major finding that I find personally very attractive, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1891.72s)]
*  and again it upsets the dominant literature on religious authority in Iran. The second [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1895.88s)]
*  preliminary conclusion is that there's a surprising appreciation for those Sunni authorities who are [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1901.4s)]
*  associated with high ranking institutions. Again Altaieb is a Sunni authority who repeatedly comes [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1907.64s)]
*  out on top among the Sunni authorities who always rank very low in terms of approval, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1912.68s)]
*  but I think that indicates sort of an appreciation for solid training and an appreciation for the [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1916.2s)]
*  institution he's associated with, and it's surprising. If I'm not mistaken, Altaieb actually [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1922.2s)]
*  comes high out higher here in a Shiite dominant context than any of the Shiite authorities in the [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1927.0s)]
*  Sunni context where we are. So I would interpret this as more appreciation for high training [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1931.24s)]
*  irrespective of sectarian questions in the Iranian context than in the Sunni context. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1938.44s)]
*  A third preliminary conclusion. Again what I mentioned, the surprisingly low support for [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1942.6s)]
*  reformist figures such as Sunni and Suruj. For Suruj that can be considered maybe to be expected [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1947.8s)]
*  because he lives in exile, he doesn't have a clerical background, but for Sunni it's really [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1953.6399999999999s)]
*  quite surprising, and one wonders whether that means that there's sort of a lack of hope now for [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1958.04s)]
*  internal reform. That those who once pinned their hope until 2009, until the Green Movement, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1962.52s)]
*  and internal theological reform have now moved away and believe well, you know, either we support [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1966.84s)]
*  regimeist figures or we turn away from religious authorities altogether. It's a question that has [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1971.24s)]
*  to be answered. The fourth preliminary finding, Romshiai's success, again this mystic who's [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1975.6399999999999s)]
*  neither clerical nor really not at all from a fichy, sort of from a background that highlights [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1981.6399999999999s)]
*  elements of Islamic law in experiences of faith, but somebody who's not a religious [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1990.4399999999998s)]
*  in experiences of faith, but somebody who's very much about mysticism and alternative notions of [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=1994.92s)]
*  religious experience, that he has such success always coming up third or fourth after the supreme [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2001.16s)]
*  leaders, I think must be interpreted as in the fact that he's a complement. Again that he's not a [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2006.8400000000001s)]
*  substitute to having a marja, but he's a complement as a religious authority, as a religious, sorry, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2014.1200000000001s)]
*  as a religious intellectual as opposed to a cleric. And finally the fact that Shariati's success is so [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2019.0s)]
*  significant, this Islamic leftist points or is I think reminiscent of the sort of political dynamics [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2024.2s)]
*  that we have observed in Iran in the last two to three years, which is really a focus on political [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2031.8s)]
*  demonstrations, not on political issues, but on bread and butter issues, economic redistribution, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2035.4s)]
*  which has become a key issue, poverty alleviation, and here Shariati as someone who really highlighted [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2039.64s)]
*  how much economic justice is part of Islam, is a core of Islam, the fact that he's highlighted in [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2045.8s)]
*  this context I think brings us back to sort of these pressing socioeconomic issues in Iran right [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2052.52s)]
*  now. Just to close with a final sentence, I think I completely agree it would be wonderful to have [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2059.32s)]
*  cross-time series data. If we could conduct this poll again in three years it would be fascinating [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2065.08s)]
*  to test the robustness of our findings now and to see whether, you know, to what extent there [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2070.44s)]
*  have been seismic shifts. I really think it would be marvelous if we could include a question on a [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2075.16s)]
*  write-in. Who do you support as a write-in rather than only choices? This is really difficult to do, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2079.64s)]
*  but I've recently done work on female religious figures and you will have noticed that none of [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2086.04s)]
*  us has included any female leaders, which is realistic because hardly any believers choose [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2090.52s)]
*  to follow a female leader. Nevertheless, in Iran and elsewhere there is growing support and [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2095.7999999999997s)]
*  appreciation for the fact that there are women who are highly trained in Islamic law who have [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2099.56s)]
*  become important figures in interpreting religious law and therefore might also rise, you know, with [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2103.48s)]
*  the next generation with changing socio-cultural attitudes as alternatives to the male figures that [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2107.8s)]
*  we have on our survey. So write-in questions would at least allow us to gauge whether anybody would [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2115.88s)]
*  consider a woman as a religious authority. And then finally, just for the Shiite context, of course, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2120.52s)]
*  it would be great to see how many people really believe the Magi are yet as important in the first [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2125.1600000000003s)]
*  place. Do you really have to choose a Magi or can you just only follow someone or find attractive [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2129.1600000000003s)]
*  someone like a mystic and leave the status and clerical sphere out of your religious experience [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2133.16s)]
*  and related to that whether it's okay to switch? We don't have an answer to this until today [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2138.6s)]
*  whether believers do switch and say, well, I follow a Haman and a virtual fertilization, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2142.8399999999997s)]
*  but I follow Sistani on, you know, his ideas on income tax. That would be really fascinating. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2147.0s)]
*  We have no data on this whatsoever. I'm wondering if it's possible if I could stand up. Sure. I'm [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2152.2799999999997s)]
*  just my coherence is inversely proportional to how comfortable I am and those are very comfortable [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2160.12s)]
*  chairs. So thank you everyone for coming and thanks to Qadr for involving me in this project. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2166.6s)]
*  So I'm going to talk about Egypt and the conventional wisdom about Egyptian politics over [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2173.08s)]
*  the last decade has basically been of a place that has been involved torn apart really by an [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2178.3599999999997s)]
*  epic bloody struggle over the proper role of Islam in public life. There's many variants [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2187.64s)]
*  to this narrative. The dramatist persona differs slightly in each of them, but the broad contours [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2193.4s)]
*  of the story are fairly fixed no matter who tells you the story. First you had so-called Islamists, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2199.48s)]
*  also referred to as religious conservatives, fundamentalists, Islamic radicals, whatever, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2206.2799999999997s)]
*  who are led by a 90-year-old pietist movement called the Society of Muslim Brothers, who ally [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2211.16s)]
*  in 2011 with non-Islamist forces, variously called secularist liberals, leftists, or just non-Islamists, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2219.64s)]
*  to overthrow the regime of Mohammed Hussein Mubarak. But as soon as they achieve this desired goal, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2227.96s)]
*  do they fall upon each other in mutual recriminations? Their differences, and the [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2235.88s)]
*  reason this is supposed to have happened, is that their differences over the future [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2242.36s)]
*  and fundamental identity of their country prove too profound for them to paper over. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2248.28s)]
*  Free and fair elections only deepen the divide as Islamists deployed their superior organizational [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2255.48s)]
*  prowess to capture the commanding heights of government, and consequently sow in their [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2261.48s)]
*  opponents' minds a suspicion of democratic processes and procedures. In the non-Islamist telling, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2268.2s)]
*  the reason that democracy was problematic was because the Brotherhood and its fellow travelers [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2277.16s)]
*  schemed to use democratic processes to alter Egypt's very character, to transform it from a [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2283.32s)]
*  place where an easy piety suffused public life into one where the harshest strictures of the most [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2290.44s)]
*  regressive interpretations of Islam would reign. In the Islamist gloss on the same basic facts, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2296.84s)]
*  their story is that their opponents were simply frustrated with their repeated losses at the [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2305.32s)]
*  ballot box, that these so-called liberals could simply not bring themselves to accept the freely [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2310.84s)]
*  made choices of a newly liberated people. Ultimately the armed agents of the state sided [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2317.96s)]
*  with the non-Islamists, swept the Muslim Brotherhood from such power as it held, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2324.28s)]
*  and inaugurated the regime that presides in Egypt to the present day. There's lots of reasons for us [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2329.64s)]
*  to quibble with this basic narrative. I, for example, questioned the extent to which Egyptians [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2335.56s)]
*  really did disagree over the things like the application of religious law. Nathan Brown has [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2341.4s)]
*  written during the Egyptian Revolution like, look, nobody's calling for a secular state. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2347.16s)]
*  But conventional wisdoms are conventional for a reason, right? They're fundamentally true. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2353.3199999999997s)]
*  That said, the dichotomization of the Egyptian political and religious landscape that this [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2359.16s)]
*  narrative assumes, i.e. of Egyptian society divided on the one hand into Islamists and on the other [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2364.92s)]
*  hand into non-Islamists, has largely outlived any analytical usefulness it may have held. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2370.52s)]
*  And it's worth noting, for example, that the military intervention in politics that overthrew [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2377.56s)]
*  the Egyptian president, Muslim Brotherhood President Mohamed Morsi in 2013, that was [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2383.24s)]
*  supported by the country's leading orthodox Islamic party called the Hezbo-Nur and by basically the [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2389.32s)]
*  entirety of the country's religious establishment. In today's Egypt, it does not look like the [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2396.52s)]
*  secular paradise of the non-Islamist dreams to the extent that they might have had that, [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2403.64s)]
*  but much more like the regressive Islamist place of their most fevered nightmares. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2410.2s)]
*  So, for example, in the Egyptian state has been taking several measures that really [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2419.0s)]
*  display a kind of adherence to a much more conservative brand of Islam. In 2017 and 2018, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2424.68s)]
*  for example, the parliament discussed proposals to criminalize atheism and homosexuality, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2431.32s)]
*  and the former of these actually does seem to be making its way through the legislative process. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2436.52s)]
*  Since 2013, several Egyptians have been thrown into jail for offenses against the state. In 2015, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2441.0s)]
*  one television personality was sentenced to a year in jail for questioning the authenticity [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2447.4s)]
*  of some sayings of the prophet Mohamed, and in 2016, four young Christians were imprisoned [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2452.92s)]
*  because an anti-ISIS video that they made strayed close to, or the regime said it, or the police [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2458.68s)]
*  said it strayed too close to displaying contempt for religion. So if there is a battle over [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2465.88s)]
*  religion in Egypt today, it is not a battle over whether religion should have any political [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2472.52s)]
*  authority, but rather over who gets to wield that authority. And the camps in this battle are the [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2478.84s)]
*  ones that we've been hearing about in all of these other countries, right? The first and most important [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2485.48s)]
*  are the religious scholars who are associated with the religious institutions of the state. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2491.6400000000003s)]
*  This includes primarily an azhar, which I describe as a publicly funded institution with a [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2497.4s)]
*  religious institution that is the Muslim world's oldest seed of religious learning and a somewhat [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2505.0s)]
*  mediocre university. Mediocre would be charitable. The Ministry of Religious Endowments, which is a [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2510.92s)]
*  government ministry that oversees mosques and religious charities, and the Dar al-Iftah, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2519.96s)]
*  or House of Religious Rulings, which basically issues interpretations of Islamic law when the [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2524.84s)]
*  government asks them to do it. These institutions collectively are generally seen as providing the [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2531.32s)]
*  state with religious cover for its policies, but it would be an oversimplification to think of them [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2537.6400000000003s)]
*  as unified or even as universally supine to state authority. And other scholars have actually shown [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2543.7200000000003s)]
*  that the legitimizing function served by these clerics actually gives them leverage over government [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2550.1200000000003s)]
*  policy and enables them to intervene and sometimes retard or even reverse government attempts at [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2556.92s)]
*  modernization or social liberalization. So that's the official religious establishment. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2563.88s)]
*  Vying with the official religious establishment for primacy in the religious realm are two major [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2569.56s)]
*  grassroots movements. The first is the one that I mentioned previously, the Society of Muslim Brothers, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2576.52s)]
*  the Muslim Brothers, which was established in 1928 by Hassan al-Banna and has really since the mid [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2583.48s)]
*  1950s served as the principal organized opposition to the military-backed regime that has dominated [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2590.6s)]
*  Egypt, except for one brief year where the Muslim Brotherhood actually had a share of power. The [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2598.76s)]
*  Muslim Brotherhood ideologically is hard to pin down. I would say that they do not necessarily [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2604.52s)]
*  represent a coherent school of Islamic thought. They certainly are conservative. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2611.4s)]
*  The application of Sharia certainly is a central plank in their platform, but I would much more [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2618.52s)]
*  describe them as having a broad religious nationalist orientation than adhering to any particular [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2625.48s)]
*  a particular school. And furthermore, I'd say that today after what took place in Egypt in 2013, [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2633.48s)]
*  the focus of the Brotherhood's activity is less on the pious reform of Egyptian society or the care [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2640.9199999999996s)]
*  of its poor, which are things that they had been engaged in, than it is on confronting the Egyptian [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2646.8399999999997s)]
*  state both domestically and internationally and calling for an end to what the Brotherhood sees as [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2653.56s)]
*  Egypt's military dictatorship. So that's one. The second major movement is the Salafi movement, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2658.84s)]
*  and there I would say it's both more extreme than the Muslim Brotherhood in its adherence to [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2665.6400000000003s)]
*  Islamic stricture and more moderate than the Muslim Brotherhood in its adherence to the status quo. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2671.08s)]
*  Courtney described Salafism as basically an approach to Islamic thought and practice that [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2677.48s)]
*  emerges primarily from the Hanbali school of Islamic jurisprudence and that seeks to derive [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2683.4s)]
*  Islamic dictates from original sources, namely the words and deeds of the Prophet Muhammad, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2688.44s)]
*  peace be upon him, and his companions collectively referred to as a Salafi Salah, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2694.28s)]
*  the righteous forebearers and Salafi preachers have, you know, over the last, I'd say, you know, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2700.04s)]
*  30 years become extremely influential in Egyptian life. We particularly through their use of [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2707.8s)]
*  satellite television where many preachers have very popular television programs, but the Salafi [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2717.96s)]
*  movement as a political force is actually relatively new and that's really only after [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2726.04s)]
*  the Egyptian revolution when they decided that this opening in the political system was going to [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2733.48s)]
*  open up certain basic questions about the character of the state and they needed to be [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2743.0s)]
*  at the table as these questions were resolved and so they participate in elections so that they [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2747.72s)]
*  could have a role in writing the constitution, etc. But then immediately upon the abrogation [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2752.52s)]
*  of that democratic experiment, they completely accommodated themselves to the existing regime, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2758.2799999999997s)]
*  for the most part. And so here I'd say that the Salafist emphasis on really cultivating [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2765.24s)]
*  personal adherence to a notion of Islamic orthodoxy renders them basically more willing than, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2773.56s)]
*  for example, a group like the Muslim Brotherhood to accommodate power as long as they're just [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2779.72s)]
*  allowed to preach and proselytize. I should also say that although I have kind of framed these two [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2783.96s)]
*  groups as competitors to Al-Azhar, they would not really describe themselves that way. They would [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2789.08s)]
*  make loud and insistent noises about the legitimacy of Al-Azhar as an institution, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2795.4s)]
*  but they would say that Al-Azhar needs to be freed from subordination to the Egyptian state. The [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2803.08s)]
*  Egyptian state does things, for example, like select Sheikh Al-Azhar and this should instead be [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2809.0s)]
*  given to some kind of democratic process, etc. Ideologically, Al-Azhar's relationship to these [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2814.6800000000003s)]
*  two groups is interesting. In 2013, shortly before the military's intervention in politics, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2822.52s)]
*  Sheikh Ahmed Al-Tayyab explained that from the standpoint of thought or creed, there isn't [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2829.88s)]
*  really anything to fear about the Muslim Brotherhood and he described a hypothetical person [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2835.0s)]
*  who could be completely saturated with the thought of Al-Azhar and yet also be a member of the Muslim [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2840.04s)]
*  Brothers. Al-Azhar's stance towards Salafists is much more confrontational and in another television [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2845.96s)]
*  interview I've seen Sheikh Al-Tayyab basically decry that Salafism tries to eliminate the natural [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2855.88s)]
*  pluralism that exists within Islam and has a tendency to label as infidels or blasphemers [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2864.76s)]
*  anybody who does not comply with their particularly narrow view. So in addition to those three groups, [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2871.64s)]
*  the official religious establishment, I'm really going to talk about Al-Azhar when we look at the [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2878.3599999999997s)]
*  data, the Muslim Brotherhood and the Salafists, there is of course also a fourth actor and that [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2883.24s)]
*  is violent, what we might call jihadist groups and I think all of these other three actors [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2889.96s)]
*  are suspicious to varying degrees of these violent groups. Al-Tayyab of Al-Azhar has referred to them [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2900.2s)]
*  as the Khawarij of the modern era, a reference to the seventh century schismatic group that [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2907.4s)]
*  assassinated Islam's fourth caliph Ali ibn Abi Talib but what I really want to emphasize is that [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2913.56s)]
*  I think that ideologically this jihadist camp really does represent a fringe camp within [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2919.72s)]
*  Egyptian society and so even though we are going we lavish a lot of attention on it, I think it's [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2927.0s)]
*  relatively fringe. Now in order to think about these groups more easily it might help and I don't know [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2932.84s)]
*  if the slides that I made were circulated, I have not given a talk without PowerPoint for 15 years [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2941.0s)]
*  so this is new terrain for me. So you might think of dividing these or putting these groups [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2947.4s)]
*  in a kind of two-dimensional space where on my vertical axis we can think about your [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2956.44s)]
*  orientation to politics so groups can be revolutionary wanting a dramatic change of the [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2963.32s)]
*  status quo or they can basically be status quo, they don't really want to change anything and on [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2969.56s)]
*  the horizontal we can think of groups that are highly textual, scripturalist, literalist, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2975.2400000000002s)]
*  you know in their interpretation of Islam they have an idea that there is only one proper [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2984.52s)]
*  interpretation of Islam and then on the other extreme we can think of groups that take a more [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2989.24s)]
*  easy going or what I'm calling consensual view of Islam and this is the idea I mean to kind of [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=2995.3199999999997s)]
*  illustrate this dimension. One thing that Salafis always get upset about is that Muslims, many Muslim [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3001.8799999999997s)]
*  mosques have tombs in them right so there will be like a cenotaph of some saint or some Islamic [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3011.88s)]
*  personage who is buried in that mosque and some Salafis have said you cannot pray in a mosque [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3018.12s)]
*  that has the cenotaph of a interred person because that gets you close to venerating that person, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3024.92s)]
*  it leads or bleeds into a shirk or associating partners with God and the response of people like [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3034.12s)]
*  Ahmed Al-Tayyab for example is to say look you know in Islam we have the concept of [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3043.2400000000002s)]
*  basically you know when there is disagreement among you and there's some question just look [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3050.44s)]
*  at what the majority of Muslims are doing and if that's what they're doing that's probably fine [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3056.2s)]
*  and the majority of Muslims happen to pray all the time in mosques with cenotaphs so get over it [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3060.36s)]
*  right so that's the dimension right the people who say don't pray in mosques and cenotaphs and the [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3065.32s)]
*  people who say it's totally fine okay you can think of that dimension. So how would we sort [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3070.36s)]
*  these groups right well we would have an azhar is a status quo power right a status quo group it [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3075.4s)]
*  wants to support the state but it also has this easy going relationship to Islam and I think this [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3080.6800000000003s)]
*  is slide two in my handout so that would be the lower left hand quadrant in the upper right hand [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3086.76s)]
*  quadrant we have a group that's also kind of you know relatively easy going with respect to [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3093.1600000000003s)]
*  Islamic practice etc but more revolutionary wants a change in the status quo and there I would put [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3098.2000000000003s)]
*  the Muslim Brotherhood okay on the other side right groups that have a scriptural interpretation [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3104.6800000000003s)]
*  literalist interpretation of Islam and our status quo is where I'd put the celibates [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3112.92s)]
*  because they accommodate whatever power is dominating they just want the freedom to [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3117.4s)]
*  preach and proselytize so the celibates I put in my lower right hand corner and then finally [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3123.96s)]
*  groups like ISIS I would put in the upper upper left hand corner both revolutionary and [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3129.96s)]
*  literalist now like any two by two table this one leaves out a lot of important information [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3137.1600000000003s)]
*  for example both the Muslim Brotherhood and ISIS in my categorization are revolutionary but of [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3143.4s)]
*  course they're revolutionary in very different ways the Muslim Brotherhood as far as I know [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3149.48s)]
*  still supports peaceful alternation of power through the balot box whereas ISIS wants some [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3154.44s)]
*  kind of apocalyptic event to bring about a religious theocracy but I take comfort in [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3159.96s)]
*  the saying that I was told in graduate school look models are to be used not believed and there's a [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3168.52s)]
*  good model for thinking about how to divide up these groups so what I want to do for the rest of [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3172.92s)]
*  the little limited time I have left is to explore how many Egyptians fall into these four camps that [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3178.52s)]
*  I have just described okay and then I want what I want to do is I want to look at what kinds of [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3185.8s)]
*  views about politics and society are associated with each of those four camps okay and I'm [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3195.5600000000004s)]
*  particularly keen on understanding whether these four camps are correlated with some [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3204.36s)]
*  attitudes towards democracy which ultimately is the thing I care most about I don't want to [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3210.44s)]
*  belabor too much the data I'm sort of the EOR of this group in terms of the data it's an enormous [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3217.0s)]
*  project it's tremendous data there are many ways in which it is unrepresentative so you know we [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3223.2400000000002s)]
*  don't have a lot of females you know my colleague said that you know 37 percent female is a little [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3230.52s)]
*  less that's a lot less than the percentage of females in a society and that definitely alters [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3238.68s)]
*  results in ways that we can't quite predict another big source of non-representativeness [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3245.16s)]
*  that we have to deal with is the fact that everybody in this survey is impaneled by a company [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3252.7599999999998s)]
*  they get paid right to fill out these surveys and so you might ask yourself are they going to be [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3258.52s)]
*  representative of the broader population I don't think that it makes the data non-usable all kinds [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3264.52s)]
*  of data particularly data in the Middle East is bad in many ways and this is way way less bad than [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3270.28s)]
*  most of the data that Middle East that Middle East folks have been forced to use but it's nonetheless [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3275.88s)]
*  important to think about some of the ways in which there is unrepresentativeness in our data and I [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3281.88s)]
*  can talk more about that later so if you look at my slides the first thing I wanted to do is just [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3288.44s)]
*  think about how many what percentage of Egyptians fall into these different camps so one question [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3294.92s)]
*  basically Egyptians are asked or everybody in the survey is asked you know how would you describe [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3300.68s)]
*  yourself and you could describe yourself an Islamist the centrist the socialist etc and 26 [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3306.28s)]
*  percent of Egyptians describe themselves as Islamist now the sample my the sample of Egyptians here is [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3311.7999999999997s)]
*  actually huge okay so it's 2941 Egyptians in Egypt plus 1337 Egyptians abroad in fact many of my [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3319.64s)]
*  colleagues in studying attitudes in the Gulf as for example Courtney mentioned a lot of it is [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3330.7599999999998s)]
*  Egyptian attitudes in the Gulf right a lot of those samples are also Egyptians which makes sense [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3337.08s)]
*  like who's gonna need to get paid you know living in the Gulf by you gov an Egyptian guy so he'll [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3342.04s)]
*  sign up so 26 percent of Egyptians in total call themselves Islamists a smaller percentage in Egypt [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3347.64s)]
*  say of those who are in Egypt say that 22 percent if you look at the most trusted religious figures [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3357.16s)]
*  um and and there's a slide there that where I've showed the most trusted religious figures by their [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3364.52s)]
*  average trust rating the number one is Ahmed Al-Tayyab the Sheikh of Al-Azhar you know everybody [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3370.44s)]
*  was asked like how much do you trust them right I don't trust at all or I trust completely [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3377.6400000000003s)]
*  Ahmed Al-Tayyab is 35 percent of the Egyptians in the sample trust him completely Shauqi Allam who [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3381.7200000000003s)]
*  is the Mufti of the Republic he's the guy who's responsible for issuing the fatwas that say the [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3389.72s)]
*  government can do this or do that about 22 percent trust him completely and then in terms of the [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3394.9199999999996s)]
*  other groups the Salafists Mohammed Hassan who's a Salafi preacher he was trusted by about 14 percent [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3402.7599999999998s)]
*  of people who trusted him completely I'm I'm just reporting to you the figure of the people on the [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3410.52s)]
*  extreme um Amr Khalid who I'm doesn't really fit into my categorization he's basically like [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3415.72s)]
*  Muslim Joel Austin you know kind of mixture of self-help and Islamic piety about 11 percent [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3423.24s)]
*  trusted him completely uh Rajab Tayyab Erdogan the Turkish president was trusted completely about [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3431.48s)]
*  13 percent and Yusuf Al-Qaradawi a Muslim scholar the chairman of the international union of Muslim [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3437.3999999999996s)]
*  scholars Qatar based but emerging out of the Muslim Brotherhood was only trusted completely [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3444.04s)]
*  by 11 percent and it's important to note that for both Qaradawi and Erdogan there was huge [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3449.0s)]
*  polarization so they had massive negatives 47 percent of people of Egyptians didn't trust [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3455.4s)]
*  Qaradawi at all and 36 percent didn't trust Erdogan at all now one thing I should note is that some of [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3461.32s)]
*  the figures uh that uh that are on that slide on slide um six uh were asked in Egypt only and [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3468.36s)]
*  some were asked in Egypt and elsewhere um and so that actually if we can find the ones that were [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3476.36s)]
*  asked in Egypt and elsewhere that can actually give us a sense of what what differences there [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3481.88s)]
*  are between Egyptians at home and Egyptians uh broad and basically what we find that is that [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3487.48s)]
*  and that's on slide seven Qaradawi Erdogan and Ghanoushi who all I would categorize as kind of [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3494.44s)]
*  Muslim Brotherhood figures are significantly more favored among Egyptians abroad than they are among [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3499.88s)]
*  Egyptians at home and that's consistent with two stories it's consistent with Sharon Grewal's story [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3505.88s)]
*  of Islamists going into exile after 2013 so they go to these Gulf countries and you know about [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3512.04s)]
*  you know 600 of them are in Saudi Arabia about 400 in the UAE 130 in Qatar about 200 in Kuwait [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3520.04s)]
*  so it's consistent with that or it's also consistent with this idea that um you know the [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3528.28s)]
*  you know there are just more conservative you know the conservative norms that exist in those places [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3535.0s)]
*  influence them more or it could be that if you're living in Egypt you're much more worried [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3540.28s)]
*  about saying good things about these people because you're worried the Egyptian state is going to [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3544.44s)]
*  get you okay so how do Egyptians sort into the four camps we described this is basically on slide [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3548.68s)]
*  eight sorry we're gonna have to wrap okay so basically I will wrap up right now and I will [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3554.68s)]
*  just say that basically here's what we find the the official state uh um uh category of Islamism [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3559.08s)]
*  right those people who you know represent the the the al-Azhar and the official state institutions [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3567.48s)]
*  are the most popular the Muslim Brotherhood and the Salafists are much less popular than those [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3574.2s)]
*  groups so that is I think consistent with something we've been hearing a lot I would say if we look at [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3580.2799999999997s)]
*  their attitudes some surprising things emerged I was expecting the Muslim Brotherhood uh people [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3585.48s)]
*  who supported the Muslim Brotherhood uh personalities more than any other personality so these people who [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3592.4399999999996s)]
*  you could actually identify in the survey as being Muslim Brothers I expected them to be much more [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3598.2799999999997s)]
*  pro-democracy uh than others that is not really the case um there's some you know uh contradictory [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3604.68s)]
*  evidence but they're certainly not more pro-democracy significant more pro-democracy [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3611.8799999999997s)]
*  than people who support the state and they are much more pro-sharia which is not surprising and [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3615.96s)]
*  surprisingly much more pro-violence so what are the policy implications basically I will I had a [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3621.7999999999997s)]
*  few but I will just say the the one um it's my strong belief that some of these concerns that [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3627.8s)]
*  we might have that emerge in the survey about the attitudes of people who are Muslim Brotherhood [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3634.1200000000003s)]
*  supporters that they may be more likely to justify violence against civilians etc these are concerning [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3639.1600000000003s)]
*  um I think that any turn to violence is fundamentally a function of restrictions in [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3645.4s)]
*  the political system but it's also true that if what we find in this data and this is preliminary [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3650.36s)]
*  finding but if what we find in this data is true um then it makes the political incorporations [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3656.52s)]
*  of a political incorporation of Islamists in Egypt in some future democratic Egypt much harder to [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3663.32s)]
*  affect and much harder to justify I'll leave it at that thank you thank you so Kadir we only have [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3669.4s)]
*  10 minutes left for the whole panel so if you could I'll wrap it up yeah thank you um okay well um [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3676.2s)]
*  I'm going to do my best impression of Yusuf in his absence well you can read his report we have [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3681.32s)]
*  available outside and online but these are going to be essentially my observations from the data on [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3686.84s)]
*  on Turkey that we have um like some other countries but unlike some others um Turkish [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3694.52s)]
*  respondents have a largely positive view of domestic actors and international figures [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3701.6400000000003s)]
*  international names that we have non-Turkish names that we have have little traction [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3709.16s)]
*  among the survey respondents so Erdogan and state affiliated religious leaders are [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3715.7999999999997s)]
*  pretty well liked especially Erdogan is well liked among respondents international figures [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3722.04s)]
*  whether this is Amit Altaib or Badadi have almost no traction whatsoever one reason for that might [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3729.8799999999997s)]
*  be the language barrier unlike you know many other countries in our survey Turks predominantly [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3736.84s)]
*  don't speak Arabic so and this is in some way similar to what we find in Iran where the domestic [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3743.2400000000002s)]
*  names have much more traction than the international figures some other observations like in Egypt [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3749.48s)]
*  where the political scene political conditions make make a big difference where the brotherhood [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3759.2400000000002s)]
*  leader Badadi is not well liked at all according to survey results same thing happens with someone [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3765.4s)]
*  who was well liked until recently when you know political conflict in the country has essentially [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3772.6s)]
*  turned him into sort of a villain character across the board Gulen is not liked and his [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3778.36s)]
*  unpopularity is to an extent that that's comparable to Islamic state leader Badadi [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3785.7200000000003s)]
*  so this is I found pretty interesting then this is true both in the direct questions we ask in [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3792.04s)]
*  terms of trust in these religious leaders in terms of approval of these religious leaders but also in [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3798.04s)]
*  the endorsement experiment so both Al Badadi and Gulen lead to much lower agreement with any given [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3803.96s)]
*  statement and this contrasts sharply with how for example Erdogan performs significantly well [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3812.52s)]
*  in both cases so Erdogan is pretty popular is his view as widely popular in in all different kinds [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3818.8399999999997s)]
*  of questions that we ask in Turkey and this has a number of reasons why that's the case looking [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3831.4s)]
*  a little bit into the data his personal religiosity is one of the factors that people like him because [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3837.4s)]
*  he likes depicting himself as a person of religion observing Muslim you know every now and then he's [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3843.24s)]
*  going to you know cry in the reading of some religious texts or he's going to recite Quran [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3849.0s)]
*  publicly so that's that's one of the attractions of him as a person attachment to public displays [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3854.3599999999997s)]
*  of religiosity is also important not only by Erdogan but also in terms of statements by other [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3863.4799999999996s)]
*  AKP leaders draws people to Erdogan because he represents the party he his charisma surpasses [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3870.44s)]
*  everyone else within the party he is the party so that's why there's a significant overlap between [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3877.32s)]
*  the two his anti-western anti-us sentiment which is pretty strong brings in a lot of support for him [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3883.4s)]
*  as an individual every now and then you will see some religiously you know related issue topic [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3892.12s)]
*  conflict tension emerging you know western world for in the western world for example or [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3900.68s)]
*  or somewhere in the middle east and you will find Erdogan among the first to criticize what's [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3906.2s)]
*  happening sort of with his anti-western anti-us sort of vitriol and this is a pretty significant [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3913.08s)]
*  often you tend to think that this is irrelevant or exaggerated but it resonates with a lot of [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3919.56s)]
*  people and this is not just among conservatives among sort of AKP support base but also [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3927.3199999999997s)]
*  a significant chunk of you know people in the left secular leftists will buy into this discourse [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3934.44s)]
*  anti-american anti-western discourse because that resonates with their anti-colonial sort of [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3940.92s)]
*  rhetoric [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3947.16s)]
*  yes and another factor i think that plays into Erdogan's popularity is his being viewed as [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3952.36s)]
*  an economic success case you know he delivers as a leader in his term in his time as a prime [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3960.68s)]
*  minister in turkey in the first decade he delivered on his promises so the turkish economy [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3968.52s)]
*  in size of turkish economy gdp per capita increased three to four fold within a decade which is [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3975.0s)]
*  incredible and a lot of people both in turkey and also outside of turkey look up to this you know [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3982.36s)]
*  as a model you know currently turkish economy is not doing well and in the last several years [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3989.16s)]
*  it's not going in a good direction but still turkey is doing well as a country in the eyes [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3994.2000000000003s)]
*  of a lot of people you know this is one of the reasons for turkish so Erdogan's popularity [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=3998.92s)]
*  region-wide he is viewed as someone who can deliver the number of arab tourists for example [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4004.2799999999997s)]
*  from the region has increased dramatically in the past decade into turkey and a lot of people want [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4009.48s)]
*  to see sort of the beauty the riches the wealth the prosperity of turkey and this is very important [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4015.7999999999997s)]
*  you know in a country in a region where you have very staunch you know cases of authoritarianism [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4022.44s)]
*  dictatorship turkey represents as a model of you know democracy that's compatible with islam [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4029.88s)]
*  and you know regardless of its flaws and there are many of them and last several you know elections [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4036.12s)]
*  probably were unfair they were manipulated and everything but nonetheless he is viewed as someone [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4041.4s)]
*  who is democratically elected and this is very important to recognize and that resonates with a [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4047.08s)]
*  lot of people because especially among the conservatives islamists throughout the region [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4052.12s)]
*  the notion of democracy for them is a majoritarian one so what matters is being elected into the [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4056.8399999999997s)]
*  office and not so much what you do in the office whether you have all democratic values pluralism [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4063.16s)]
*  you know minority rights that's secondary that can be you know sacrificed for political purposes [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4068.8399999999997s)]
*  what's important is that he continues to be elected into that particular office so that has [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4075.08s)]
*  a lot of attraction among people especially among conservatives in turkey and outside of turkey [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4080.04s)]
*  and one thing that's kind of marginal but i want to emphasize that the spread of turkish dramas [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4085.88s)]
*  in across the region is really something to to to reckon you know it expands turkeys especially [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4095.48s)]
*  akps and ardron soft power soft influence throughout the region you know in one particular [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4104.2s)]
*  example never expected this to happen when i was in morocco back in 2009 it's almost a decade [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4108.92s)]
*  i'm walking in the streets of a city in the north and i'm walking by so this is like 11 o'clock at [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4115.96s)]
*  night i'm going to my hotel and i see i passed by a very small coffee shop you know in the middle of [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4123.32s)]
*  nowhere essentially and i saw a turkish drama playing you know valley of the wolves and this [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4129.8s)]
*  is just incredible i mean and you know whoever you talk to in the arab world people are watching one [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4135.08s)]
*  or another kind of turkish drama and this is this is pretty significant you know this this this gives [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4141.4s)]
*  this or conveys this positive image of turkey turkish politics and who is responsible for this [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4147.32s)]
*  you know the party that's in power for the past 16 17 years and this is this is very important to [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4154.12s)]
*  recognize and ardron builds on this by coming out at critical junctures you know when you move [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4160.839999999999s)]
*  the u.s embassy to jerusalem what happens erdogan is the most strong strongest you know opponent of [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4168.120000000001s)]
*  this move and he's going to try to rally people around this particular issue same thing you know [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4175.0s)]
*  just a few days ago the new zealand mosque shooting he used this as an opportunity to rally [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4182.6s)]
*  against the west against the against not us but against the west in terms of islamophobia in the [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4190.68s)]
*  west and the inaction that's taking place in in the west in in very broad strokes whether that's [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4196.52s)]
*  empirically accurate or not is irrelevant that's a rhetoric that's a discourse that resonates with [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4204.280000000001s)]
*  a lot of people and that's why it's important i think to recognize the sort of the pillars of his [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4210.200000000001s)]
*  influence in the region not only in turkey so what are some of the implications you know [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4217.400000000001s)]
*  anti-americanism anti-western discourse is bleeds into religious discourse oftentimes and that's [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4227.4800000000005s)]
*  something that to be careful one last point i want to raise before it's too long is especially in the [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4234.76s)]
*  case of turkey and ardron the sloppy use of religious discourse by the west by the u.s [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4242.280000000001s)]
*  or you know non-careful use of religious discourse or ideas is going to come back to haunt us policy [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4252.92s)]
*  in the news you know it doesn't have to be a religious policy it doesn't have to you know [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4259.08s)]
*  sort of relate to any kind of religious actors in the in the region but this is a rallying point [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4263.64s)]
*  any and all u.s policies you know that will you know run afoul of religion in one way whether [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4269.88s)]
*  intentional or unintentional is going to come back to haunt us policy and this is some this is why [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4277.56s)]
*  it's very important to take this in seriously you know this very deep seated especially in turkey [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4282.28s)]
*  but also in the rest of the region is anti-american anti-u.s sentiment anti-western sentiment and how [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4288.12s)]
*  that that that overlaps largely with the with the religious inclinations of of people in the region [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4294.2s)]
*  i'll stop here maybe more in the q&a great thank you so we just have time for a couple of questions [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4302.04s)]
*  but i do want to take a few maybe we'll take two at once one right here and if you could please [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4307.8s)]

*  countries and pakistan was not um mentioned is there any kind of is you just keep pakistan or [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4352.84s)]

*  religion intolerance what is going on here that was not taken into account pakistan [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4369.719999999999s)]
*  thank you we'll take another question as well there is one up here up front [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4376.12s)]
*  um [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4381.0s)]
*  john anderson uh independent analyst yeah uh question to direct the tawdik miss out finding his [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4385.4s)]
*  overall description uh narrative with regard to egypt and and the political and social actors [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4392.12s)]
*  there and referring particularly to the muslim brotherhood on the one hand and the salafists [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4398.36s)]
*  on the other um i don't want to put out a counter narrative here because uh i think you've captured [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4403.32s)]
*  quite well but with regard to quote external influences there has been a lot of discussion [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4410.36s)]
*  regarding funding and obviously the when was mean are an international movement i don't mean that [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4416.12s)]
*  they have you know direct funding to activities within egypt i kind of doubt it myself of more [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4424.44s)]
*  of the talk has been of course in terms of the salafis and funding from gulf saudi etc [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4432.76s)]
*  again not that that's the major influence on what makes egyptians move politically but can [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4441.0s)]
*  you comment at all with regard to um external influences and funding i think we'll take one [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4446.04s)]
*  more and unfortunately this must be our last one any other questions yes [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4453.08s)]
*  uh [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4458.36s)]
*  this is a little bit outside uh your scope but uh there was a reference to anti-americanism [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4464.04s)]
*  and so on and middle east policy and i'm wondering whether the speakers might be able to [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4471.719999999999s)]
*  comment on phenomena such as the recent election to congress of uh several a couple of muslim [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4479.08s)]
*  women and uh their positions on the middle east maybe you've seen uh ilhan omar's uh column in [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4488.12s)]
*  the washington post on monday thank you okay so we are standing between these good people in their [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4495.96s)]
*  lunch so if we can have very brief responses let me respond to the first um comment so we wanted to [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4503.0s)]
*  geographically limit what we can do uh with our survey because i mean we have limited resources [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4508.68s)]
*  and we wanted to focus on in the middle east and north africa region primarily sometimes afghanistan [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4513.96s)]
*  pakistan are included in in the sort of middle east region but that's oftentimes a little bit [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4520.52s)]
*  of a stretch so that's why we did not want to include countries that are conventionally accepted [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4527.4800000000005s)]
*  within the middle east and north africa region that's the only region pakistan was not including the [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4533.56s)]
*  sorry but i'm i'm sure the results would be quite interesting in pakistan because of the [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4538.84s)]
*  tremendous sort of diversity in the religious realm in pakistan [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4544.68s)]
*  thoughts on the congressional question [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4551.56s)]
*  sure i mean just very quickly from my personal experience with friends in the region and [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4556.04s)]
*  and activity i've seen on twitter it seems like a very positive response to the muslims who have [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4561.400000000001s)]
*  been elected to office kind of showing kind of reaffirming their faith in american democracy to [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4566.44s)]
*  see that muslim immigrants including refugees can become congresswomen in the u.s and so in general [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4571.32s)]
*  the the outpouring i've seen from the region but again it's it's my based on the the audience i [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4579.24s)]
*  interact with has been very positive in terms of reaffirming their faith in democracy in the u.s [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4584.679999999999s)]
*  so the external question so i will just you know i think the question that both of you asked is [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4589.88s)]
*  is so i think one a shortcoming particularly of my contribution is that i have tended to view [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4596.36s)]
*  egyptian politics as sort of hermetically sealed and you are [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4605.56s)]
*  correctly pointing out that there are lots of very important international influences [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4609.08s)]
*  the selefi movement in egypt has received a lot of support and funding from the gulf and [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4613.56s)]
*  particularly saudi arabia the muslim brotherhood as you know it is embedded in a kind of broader [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4618.04s)]
*  international network and one of the interesting questions for us going forward and cortney is [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4622.44s)]
*  more qualified to talk about than i am as is as saudi arabia seems to be abandoning an extreme [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4626.76s)]
*  form of kind of exporting exporting an extreme form of selefism what does that mean for their [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4633.24s)]
*  clients in some of these other places on the ilhan amr question i think i've seen a lot of what [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4638.84s)]
*  dr gurwal is talking about but i've also seen the opposite it's not lost on me that [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4646.360000000001s)]
*  the one of the great takedowns of the hand omaran roshid aflib was published in a saudi-funded [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4650.84s)]
*  news outlet and in part because it was seen as these people have muslim brotherhood sympathies [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4657.400000000001s)]
*  and are consequently you know anti-saudi etc of course they're also lgbt activists so if this is [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4664.76s)]
*  the kind of evolution of the muslim brotherhood then maybe we're all for it please join me in [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4671.56s)]
*  thanking all four panels for really fascinating presentations and lunch will be served outside [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4676.200000000001s)]
*  and we'll reconvene at one o'clock thank you [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLkUMPL6HI&t=4682.4400000000005s)]
