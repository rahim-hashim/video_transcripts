# Beirut Blast | What's Next for Lebanon and Its Government?
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [August 14, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKcGr_MCgKs)
*  Well, the next steps are the president has to call for mandatory consultations with the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKcGr_MCgKs&t=0.0s)]
*  parliament that will then nominate a prime minister. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKcGr_MCgKs&t=7.28s)]
*  What will likely happen is the president is going to delay these nominations, these mandatory [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKcGr_MCgKs&t=14.76s)]
*  sorry, consultations, which is what he did last time, until there is a consensus and [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKcGr_MCgKs&t=20.48s)]
*  agreement between the political parties and the international community in this case on [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKcGr_MCgKs&t=25.82s)]
*  the name of the next prime minister. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKcGr_MCgKs&t=31.380000000000003s)]
*  There are different versions floating around right now. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKcGr_MCgKs&t=34.1s)]
*  The two scenarios I see ahead is either possibly a transitional government with an independent [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKcGr_MCgKs&t=37.18s)]
*  prime minister, a veteran, someone who is not a novice to the political game, with an [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKcGr_MCgKs&t=45.14s)]
*  independent cabinet, exceptional powers, etc. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKcGr_MCgKs&t=53.22s)]
*  Or the other version, I think this is what Paul was talking about, and that would be [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKcGr_MCgKs&t=56.66s)]
*  mandated to do the economic reform, negotiate with IMF. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKcGr_MCgKs&t=60.78s)]
*  This would be a cabinet for maybe six months to a year after which it would have prepared [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKcGr_MCgKs&t=64.66s)]
*  the road for early elections, early elections, i.e. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKcGr_MCgKs&t=69.58s)]
*  in 2021. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKcGr_MCgKs&t=72.78s)]
*  That's as early as they can get. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKcGr_MCgKs&t=73.9s)]
*  The other road is most likely the more likely one, well, not more likely, we don't know yet. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKcGr_MCgKs&t=75.82s)]
*  It's a bit too early to tell. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKcGr_MCgKs&t=81.1s)]
*  It's possibly a government with Prime Minister Hariri again, but with under the conditions [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKcGr_MCgKs&t=82.74s)]
*  that he had, sorry. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKcGr_MCgKs&t=92.02s)]
*  Who resigned in November already. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKcGr_MCgKs&t=94.94s)]
*  Who resigned in November. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKcGr_MCgKs&t=96.53999999999999s)]
*  But it would be under the terms that he had asked for at the time when he was asked to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKcGr_MCgKs&t=99.3s)]
*  form a new government, which is to come back with again a number of a cabinet that is acceptable [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKcGr_MCgKs&t=103.66s)]
*  to the international community, but also acceptable to the Lebanese. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKcGr_MCgKs&t=110.74s)]
