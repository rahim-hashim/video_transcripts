# Brown on the Post-Oslo Era
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [February 09, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E)
*  Palestinians are clearly at a turning point right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=0.0s)]
*  The structures that have been governing Palestinian life really for a couple decades now have [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=13.96s)]
*  no more political scaffolding. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=21.36s)]
*  When you had a series of agreements negotiated with Israel in the mid-1990s, it set up a [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=22.92s)]
*  series of arrangements over economics, politics, and so on. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=28.28s)]
*  Those were supposed to lead to, in Palestinian eyes, to a Palestinian state. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=32.28s)]
*  In Israeli eyes, to a comprehensive settlement. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=36.68s)]
*  It's clear they're not going there, but that's been clear for a while. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=39.08s)]
*  What's new, and the reason why I think Palestinians realize that they're at a turning point, is [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=42.28s)]
*  that there used to be a community of leaders, Israelis, Palestinians, Americans, Europeans, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=46.72s)]
*  who kept these structures afloat even though they didn't seem to be leading in any particular [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=53.08s)]
*  direction. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=57.44s)]
*  Now, one by one, these various actors are checking out. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=58.44s)]
*  Palestinian population as a whole, I think, lost faith in this process and a lot of the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  structures a long time ago. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=68.12s)]
*  What's new is that the very top leadership in Ramallah, Abu Mazen, President Mahmoud [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=69.72s)]
*  Abbas, and the people around him, are increasingly acting in ways that put these structures at [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=74.92s)]
*  risk. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=79.56s)]
*  They say it's just not leading anywhere. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=80.56s)]
*  The Israeli leadership, for its part, right now you have a center-right government under [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, and it has made clear that it doesn't necessarily see these structures [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=86.36s)]
*  as really worth fighting for and preserving. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=91.0s)]
*  Israelis are a little bit divided on this. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=93.0s)]
*  The Europeans have been supporting it financially. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=94.91999999999999s)]
*  They're getting close to exhausted, and the Americans aren't recommending any alternative, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=96.83999999999999s)]
*  but they've clearly run out of ideas about how to keep these structures alive. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=102.11999999999999s)]
*  The American approach, really for a generation or more, has been to say we need bilateral [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=106.36s)]
*  negotiations, which makes sense, but then to go on to say anything other than direct [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=111.84s)]
*  bilateral Israeli-Palestinian negotiations is bad. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=116.72s)]
*  That's what I think really needs to be questioned. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=120.2s)]
*  What the Israelis and Palestinians are doing is fighting this conflict in a variety of [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=122.64s)]
*  fora. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=126.72s)]
*  Some are violent and some are nonviolent. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=127.72s)]
*  Some are UN, international law, and so on, and then sometimes there's direct fighting. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=129.56s)]
*  I think the international community can shape where these conflicts are being fought. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=133.52s)]
*  Israelis and Palestinians who are battling themselves out in the realm of diplomacy and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=139.08s)]
*  international law, that's not necessarily a bad thing, and that doesn't have to be seen [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=143.0s)]
*  as an alternative to bilateral negotiations, but as a way of ensuring that whatever negotiations [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=147.08s)]
*  do eventually take place do so within a sound international diplomatic and legal framework. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQMGov8lB7E&t=151.84s)]
