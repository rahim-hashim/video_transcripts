Video Description: U.S. relations with Iran may soon arrive at a crossroads. While Iranians protest in the streets, the regime has armed Russia with drones for its war on Ukraine, and nuclear negotiations are at a standstill. Meanwhile, bilateral relations with Saudi Arabia are tension-ridden, and many observers in Washington are calling for a rethink of America’s whole approach to the region. What are the big strategic options that the United States should be considering when it comes to the future of American policy toward Iran? What’s realistic and what’s not?

Join Christopher Chivvis for a discussion with Aaron David Miller, Suzanne Maloney, and Henry Rome on the big choices the Biden administration should be considering.

# What Are America’s Strategic Options on Iran?
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [November 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A)
*  Welcome. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Chris Chivas, the director of the Carnegie Endowments Program on American Statecraft. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=10.28s)]
*  And we're here today to take a look at U.S. strategy towards Iran. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=15.6s)]
*  Protests in Iran are now coming towards their third month. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=21.88s)]
*  Iran has provided weapons to Russia, specifically the Shahad drones, in order to help Russia in its war on Ukraine. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=26.919999999999998s)]
*  The nuclear talks that have been going on, again, since the beginning of the Biden administration, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=35.72s)]
*  are stalled and have been now for several weeks. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=41.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, U.S.-Saudi relations are in a state of disrepair. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  Iran's nuclear program seems to be moving forward. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=50.4s)]
*  Iran is continuing its destabilizing regional activities, threatening former U.S. officials, and engaging in other hostile acts. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  So in light of all of this, and especially the protests and the lack of progress on the nuclear talks, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=65.56s)]
*  we thought it would be helpful and interesting to get some knowledgeable people together to talk broadly about U.S. strategy towards Iran. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=72.8s)]
*  What are the real options? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=81.96s)]
*  What tools are available and which are likely to be effective? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=83.76s)]
*  What are the risks involved with different approaches as we look out over towards the medium term? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=88.48s)]
*  And ultimately, what are America's interests in Iran and how might they be changing? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=94.16000000000001s)]
*  So as I said, I've got three great experts here to help me think this through. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=99.4s)]
*  To my far right, I have Henry Rome, who is a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  Immediately to my right, I have Suzanne Maloney, who is the vice president and director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=114.04s)]
*  And to my left, I have Aaron David Miller, a colleague of mine here at the Carnegie Endowment, where he is a senior fellow. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=122.36s)]
*  All three of you have obviously got deep expertise, not just on Iran, but also on thinking about U.S. policy to Iran, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=129.84s)]
*  which is really what I want to focus on today. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=136.44s)]
*  So welcome. I appreciate all three of you being here. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  What I'm hoping that I can do, Suzanne, is actually to start with you and ask if you'd be willing to provide us with a sort of summary of how you've seen U.S. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=142.28s)]
*  policy toward Iran evolve in recent years. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=151.32s)]
*  Well, thanks so much, Chris, for including me in this discussion. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=155.96s)]
*  I'm really glad to be here and look forward to learning from all of our conversation. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=158.8s)]
*  I think what's most notable about Iran in the context of U.S. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=164.04s)]
*  policy is despite the fact that it is highly contested and highly politicized, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=168.23999999999998s)]
*  there has been, in fact, a considerable degree of consistency in U.S. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=173.88s)]
*  policy toward Tehran since 1979. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  The basic contours of the U.S. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=182.44s)]
*  approach to Iran were formed in the days after the seizure of the U.S. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=184.64s)]
*  embassy in November of 1979. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=188.48s)]
*  And at that time, the Carter administration created a sort of crisis working group that set forward two main tools or levers of policy. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  One would be diplomacy, persuasion. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=199.68s)]
*  The other would be pressure, coercion. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  And that basic balance has been applied by every U.S. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=205.32s)]
*  administration from both the Republican and the Democratic side, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=209.64s)]
*  to greater or lesser degrees, with considerable degree of consistency over now 43 years. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=214.48s)]
*  Despite the fact that we see so much partisan bickering over Iran, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=222.68s)]
*  every American president has sought to engage directly through diplomacy with Iranian leadership in hopes of trying to change its behavior. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=228.0s)]
*  And every American president from both parties has sought to use coercive tools, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=236.04s)]
*  both military and economic, to try to pressure Iran to change its behavior. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=240.79999999999998s)]
*  And for most of those 43 years, we've had fairly limited degrees of success. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=245.28s)]
*  And we can talk about why that is. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=249.6s)]
*  I think it's been very clear that the past two decades of U.S. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  policy toward Iran has been very much dominated by concerns about the nuclear program. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=256.92s)]
*  A little marked anniversary early a couple of months ago was the anniversary of the disclosure of Iran's [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=261.96s)]
*  secret enrichment facility, which provoked a crisis in 2002 about what to do about a program that was [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=270.48s)]
*  further along than the international community had previously publicly acknowledged with respect to Iran's nuclear ambitions. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=278.72s)]
*  There had been longstanding rhetoric about Iran's pursuit of WMD, I think dating back to probably the late 90s. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=284.92s)]
*  Those of you who remember that coming from both the United States and Israel. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=293.20000000000005s)]
*  But it was in August of 2002 that revelations about Iran's enrichment capabilities that had not been disclosed to the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  International Atomic Energy Agency actually precipitated a crisis, precipitated new diplomacy toward Iran, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  but really put the nuclear issue at the centerpiece of American interests and concerns with respect to Iran. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=310.52000000000004s)]
*  And I would say that, you know, again, with some variation, but with a lot of consistency, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=317.24s)]
*  both Republican and Democratic administrations, whether it was Bush and Trump on the Republican side or Obama and now Biden [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=323.24s)]
*  on the Democratic side, have really prioritized the nuclear issue above all others for the obvious reason that it [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=330.68s)]
*  creates a certain degree of urgency, especially as we've seen Iran's capabilities grow. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=336.84000000000003s)]
*  I think that's really helpful to get us started because that's exactly you've already touched on some of the things that I was [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=343.64s)]
*  hoping to talk about, especially whether or not the nuclear issue, which has really been at the center of America's approach to Iran [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=348.72s)]
*  for at least the last decade, if not more, is still the issue that ought to be at the center of it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=356.20000000000005s)]
*  And then obviously the question of whether or not we have the right balance between military or coercive and diplomatic tools. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  That's what I'm hoping to explore. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=369.20000000000005s)]
*  But maybe we can start, Henry, maybe with you on the question of diplomacy. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=371.04s)]
*  I mean, one of the things that has occurred to me is that, I mean, obviously, you know, the Biden administration has kept the military option on the table. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=373.88s)]
*  Obviously, the Trump administration exercised the military option, although not with regard to the nuclear program. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=381.76s)]
*  But in general, certainly in the Obama administration and the Biden administration, the emphasis has been on diplomacy and it's been on trying to achieve [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=388.47999999999996s)]
*  perhaps some kind of a rapprochement or at least a detente with Iran through the nuclear negotiations while also achieving the objective of preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=397.16s)]
*  With the talk stalled, with the protests now in the street, I sort of am looking at this and saying, you know, is there is the diplomatic path, is the diplomatic option being taken off the table? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=406.68s)]
*  And there's two ways of thinking about that. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=420.96000000000004s)]
*  One is, you know, certainly in the near term, obviously, there's all kinds of complications that arise from the situation. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=423.64000000000004s)]
*  I'd like to hear your thoughts on that. But also longer term, are we inevitably headed towards a period of where we rebalance more towards military and coercive options and away from the diplomatic option? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=429.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, and thanks so much for the opportunity to be here today. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=441.64000000000004s)]
*  And I think Suzanne set it up very nicely in thinking about the kind of balances between diplomatic efforts and kind of coercive, either military or economic measures. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=444.08000000000004s)]
*  You know, I think the administration and and and Rob Malley talked with talked with Aaron just earlier this week has made it quite clear that diplomatic options are still very much on the table. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=454.56s)]
*  And from their point of view, JCPOA is still is still on the table. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=464.28000000000003s)]
*  I think it's worth us kind of discussing today that there is a distinction between JCPOA being, you know, for how long if if it's not already a viable tool versus diplomacy writ large, whether that's something, you know, broader than JCPOA, reframe JCPOA smaller. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=467.48s)]
*  There are a lot of different options that that that you can slice and dice there. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=486.16s)]
*  Now, that that that being said, it does seem clear from Iran's positions within the confines of the nuclear talks and in the broader environment, both with its support of Russia against Ukraine and in terms of its crackdown against against civilians over over the past several months, that diplomacy is not at the front of its mind in terms of seeing the nuclear agreement and sanctions relief as something that's worth sacrificing for, at least for for for the foreseeable future. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=490.72s)]
*  I think for for the United States over the longer term, I kind of see the kind of trend of vacillation between diplomatic and economic and military tools continuing. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=520.72s)]
*  I think while JCPOA may well be dead, although I'm not sure that we are able to kind of read its last rights quite yet, the kind of options available to the United States to address the nuclear program are are very limited when if you were to remove diplomacy from the table entirely. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=531.28s)]
*  So I expect that to continue to be a key aspect in the US toolkit, and I think it should be. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=550.16s)]
*  I would want to come back to you and ask you about diplomacy, broader diplomacy beyond JCPOA, because that's an interesting question and one that I want to explore. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=556.24s)]
*  But before I do that, Aaron, I wanted to get your your reaction to this. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=563.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, do you do you sort of agree with with the views that you've just heard? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=566.36s)]
*  Well, you know, my sense is that you've got eight eight American presidents who dealt with Iran since the revolution, including Joe Biden. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=570.24s)]
*  And I think our policy is more or less toggled back and forth between a view that somehow we could moderate or change the behavior of the regime on one hand or pressure it into submission on the other. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=578.88s)]
*  And this toggling, I think, reflects a much broader problem. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=589.8s)]
*  The real focal point of our of our difficulties lies not in Washington, but in Tehran and in the nature of the regime. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=593.1999999999999s)]
*  And I think you really need to distinguish between options, which are simply tools and solutions. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=602.36s)]
*  We have a military option against Iran, but we have no military solution. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=611.24s)]
*  We have a political diplomatic option to engage Iran. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=616.7199999999999s)]
*  And if you pointed out, Chris, we've channeled it through a very narrow focus of trying to turn constraint, ultimately eliminate Iran's nuclear option. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=620.9599999999999s)]
*  But we do not have a political solution. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=630.88s)]
*  Our relationship with Iran for decades at best has been transactional, not transformational. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=634.36s)]
*  And that, in essence, to me, is is the strategic problem that we face with a regime who that looks at the United States as a fundamental adversary and maneuvers and manipulates Washington in order to preserve its own power. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=642.0s)]
*  The real question is, you know, all of these options or tools, what, in fact, is the end state? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=660.32s)]
*  And I think that demands a rigorous answer to the question, since form follows function. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=668.72s)]
*  What what are American interests when it comes to Iran? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=676.84s)]
*  What are we trying to achieve? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=683.12s)]
*  And that question, I mean, when you talk strategic option strategy, what's a strategy? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=686.2800000000001s)]
*  It's a plan or a policy with the aim to accomplish some overall objective. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=693.5999999999999s)]
*  And I think that, in essence, is a problem. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=702.8399999999999s)]
*  I know where I come out at the end of the conversation. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=705.68s)]
*  I don't believe in transformations. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=712.1199999999999s)]
*  They are very rare, certainly engineered American transformations. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=714.04s)]
*  So it's a very transactional approach. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=718.4s)]
*  It's been that way for decades. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=720.92s)]
*  We've aired very often and made this situation worse. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=723.24s)]
*  But we've also at times, I think, understood what those interests are and have sought to achieve them. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=728.36s)]
*  It's just you're dealing, in my judgment, with a regime that unless, look, unless the regime is changed, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=736.28s)]
*  it seems to me we're going to be into a policy at best of deterrence and containment going forward. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=746.44s)]
*  I want to talk about a number of things that you that you've mentioned, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=756.0s)]
*  including the question of how we ought to be thinking about American interests in Iran as we look out over the course of, say, the next five, five years or so. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=759.24s)]
*  But just for a point of clarification, you said that there is a military option, but not a military solution. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=766.72s)]
*  Would you say the same thing of diplomacy, which was my original question? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=773.76s)]
*  Is there a diplomatic solution or or just like as with the military tool, is there only a diplomatic option? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=777.2s)]
*  If you mean solution by end state that the United States, through its own incentives and disincentives, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=783.48s)]
*  could create a situation where we have a fully normalized relationship with with the regime in power, the answer is absolutely not. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=790.76s)]
*  There is no solution. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=800.4s)]
*  This is a management exercise because we fundamentally lack the means, the capacity, the will and the staying power. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=801.56s)]
*  And I'm not arguing for regime change because I think our record on regime change in this region has been, you know, unbelievably disastrous. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=811.4399999999999s)]
*  Since the Arab Spring, we've tried various means to deal with various countries. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=822.68s)]
*  In Iraq, it was a full scale invasion. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=829.3599999999999s)]
*  In Syria, it was standing on the sidelines, but spending almost a billion dollars to support Sunni militias. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=831.5999999999999s)]
*  In Libya, it was partial military intervention. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=837.76s)]
*  If you look at where all of these things ended up, you come to the conclusion that any number of people, our former colleagues, Karim Sajipour, Ray Takei, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=840.76s)]
*  that in the end, it is the Iranian people's agency that will ultimately create a situation where Iran becomes a better partner for the United States. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=855.2s)]
*  I see our role, our role is important, but it's derivative, frankly, when it comes to the end state. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=871.6800000000001s)]
*  That's another issue that I want to pick up on is how much influence the United States ultimately has over outcomes in Iran. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=882.16s)]
*  But just to stay with the diplomatic theme for another minute or two, Suzanne, do you think, do you see any diplomatic paths beyond the nuclear negotiations? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=890.04s)]
*  Are there other issues? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=902.0799999999999s)]
*  And I don't necessarily mean today because it's not an opportune movement for a diplomatic initiative, probably right now. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=903.0s)]
*  But over the course of the next few years, are there other areas where the United States or our European allies might attempt to explore other paths for having some kind of a diplomatic relationship with Iran? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=910.28s)]
*  Or are they completely, is that just off the table for the medium term? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=923.64s)]
*  I think it's been off the table for much of the past 40 years. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=927.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, you know, remember the sort of diplomacy around the JCPOA or the final years of diplomacy around the JCPOA was a rare instance in which the Iranian leadership was willing to countenance direct dialogue with official American representatives. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=930.7199999999999s)]
*  That had been primarily off the table for the Iranians after the revolution. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=947.9599999999999s)]
*  There was, of course, the Iran-Contra episode, which ended disastrously for both sides and on the Iranian side ended in the execution of those involved. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=953.4s)]
*  And so made it even more problematic for direct official authorized dialogue between the two parties for in the aftermath. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=962.16s)]
*  That taboo was broken first through the covert diplomacy of the Obama administration to engage with the Iranians. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=971.16s)]
*  And then later through the official talks, obviously situated in a broader multilateral context, which I think was key to persuading the Iranian leadership to engage. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=979.12s)]
*  Since the Trump administration walked away from the nuclear deal in 2018, there has been no direct engagement diplomatically between the United States and Iran. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=988.48s)]
*  And that, again, is not our fault. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=996.4399999999999s)]
*  That is not within our control. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=998.04s)]
*  And so I think, you know, when we think about the possibilities for diplomacy, we have to be quite realistic. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1000.68s)]
*  We've been engaged in proximity talks now for what, 20 months that have made, I think, probably as much progress as anyone could have possibly hoped, given the constraints and given the political circumstances, not just between the United States and Iran, but more generally between the great powers, which has significantly limited American leverage in terms of dealing with the nuclear issue. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1005.88s)]
*  But we still can't persuade the Iranians to sign on the dotted line. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1027.8000000000002s)]
*  And that was before the country erupted in what I think is the beginning of a revolution that will absolutely change the nature of the government eventually within Iran. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1030.5600000000002s)]
*  So I have very, very pessimistic prospects in my own estimation for what we can do diplomatically. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1039.3200000000002s)]
*  I think there are probably still places where we ought to be trying. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1046.92s)]
*  The primary one that I would point to is just the release of dual national and American and other European prisoners who've been held in Iran in some cases as long as seven years. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1049.8s)]
*  We have a responsibility to continue to try to use every opportunity to see those people freed because they're being held purely as hostages. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1059.36s)]
*  But the idea that we could talk to the Iranians and we've all written a thousand memos to talk about places where there might be mutual interests, anti-piracy, anti-narcotics around the region. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1067.36s)]
*  I mean, under the current circumstances, with the country aflame, with Iran providing offensive weaponry to Russia, with the nuclear talks stalled and with no capacity for direct dialogue, those seem somewhat fanciful at this time. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1078.52s)]
*  Does that mean that there's all the more reason to try to keep the nuclear talks going even against all odds simply because it's the only issue on which there is a diplomatic channel? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1094.44s)]
*  Or would you say that it's actually not pertinent? [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1105.2s)]
*  Personally, I think the nuclear process has run aground and we have to recognize that. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1108.92s)]
*  We have to acknowledge that. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1114.56s)]
*  I don't see any meaningful prospect of getting a durable agreement with a government that's engaged in the way both at home and around the region and now outside the region in such a deeply provocative way. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1115.92s)]
*  And I would kind of point back to the experience of 2009 when even in the aftermath of the Green Revolution, the kind of uprising that took place after the contested reelection of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the Obama administration remained, I think, understandably, justifiably fixated on trying to get to some kind of viable negotiations with the Iranians around the nuclear crisis. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1130.88s)]
*  They continued to pursue overtures. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1158.12s)]
*  They actually got to a confidence building measure that was announced with great fanfare in October 2009 by Carnegie's former president and now director of the CIA, Bill Burns, that there would be a sort of an agreement around provision of uranium for the Tehran Research Reactor. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1160.84s)]
*  That agreement fell apart almost as quickly as it was announced simply because of the turmoil within the Iranian leadership. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1179.36s)]
*  And I think that we're in a situation today where not just because of what's happening on the streets, not just because of the way the Iranians have thrown their bets fully in with both Russia and China, especially around Ukraine, but also because we can see in real time that this is a leadership whose resilience and capacity is eroding as they prepare for what is likely to be a very turbulent succession process when and eventually when the supreme leader passes from the scene, he's 83 at this time. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1186.56s)]
*  So I think the idea that we're going to be able to get a deal finalized, signed, implemented, and that it's going to last until 2031, as the original deal was intended to do, again, just seems highly unrealistic to me. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1216.32s)]
*  And so I think the idea that this should remain at the center point of the way that we approach Iran has been overtaken by events. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1230.6799999999998s)]
*  Henry, you had said earlier that you thought there might be options beyond the nuclear deal. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1240.6399999999999s)]
*  What would those be for diplomacy with Iran? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1246.08s)]
*  Again, and I understand not necessarily today, but if we look out over the medium term. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1249.56s)]
*  I agree with Suzanne on this. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1252.9599999999998s)]
*  I mean, it was more of a framing exercise than actually saying I think there's practical options. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1255.24s)]
*  But I think it is worth saying, and I guess I disagree a bit with Suzanne here, in that at least keeping the option, if not JCPOA, a some kind of diplomatic approach that trades nuclear constraints for sanctions relief. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1260.04s)]
*  I think there's still value in keeping that ostensibly on the table, even if the kind of prospects of securing it continue to go down. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1274.88s)]
*  I think there is still an interest in kind of short term diffusing Iran's nuclear progress in exchange for sanctions relief that I think continues to be in American interest. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1283.72s)]
*  Although, you know, and I think the downside with declaring the talks dead, which, you know, as a practical matter, there are no talks right now. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1297.32s)]
*  So de facto, there aren't talks going on. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1306.52s)]
*  So there's no talks to kind of pull pull pull out of the downside is you have to come up with with with an alternative. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1309.04s)]
*  And I think at I mean, I think we can discuss here that there are lots of lots of options that the U.S. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1315.44s)]
*  could try to put forward. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1320.84s)]
*  But if the administration is not willing or not not able to put forward a kind of clear alternative plan, then I think the kind of status quo will will continue in that there is a an option for a deal on the table, even if, you know, neither side is really taking steps, and especially on the Iranian side to make it more likely. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1321.84s)]
*  And would you keep the talks going, even though the prospects of any progress seem increasingly dim? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1342.68s)]
*  Suzanne and Henry raise really good points. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1349.8400000000001s)]
*  Imagine imagine this two months from now, the Iranian regime manages to find a way to tamp down the demonstrations. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1352.3600000000001s)]
*  But in the intervening two months, you've got what's the casualty total now? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1362.96s)]
*  Now, in the hundreds, let's say it's almost a thousand. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1368.2s)]
*  And you've got those pictures framed everywhere. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1372.68s)]
*  Iranians come back needing economic relief, want to engage. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1376.6s)]
*  It's now January, February of 2020, three. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1382.2s)]
*  The Republicans now control at least the House and the Iranians agree on a set of terms where the negotiators left off. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1386.6399999999999s)]
*  What do you suppose the reaction of the Biden administration is going to be? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1398.6399999999999s)]
*  Can you in effect see a process of diplomacy as Suzanne has identified with the Iranians providing thousands of drones and maybe even service service missiles to Putin, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1404.3999999999999s)]
*  whose campaign in Ukraine is going to be ongoing and also oppressing and repressing their own citizens on the street? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1421.1999999999998s)]
*  I think the Biden administration would have an excruciatingly difficult time making a decision under those circumstances. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1429.16s)]
*  So let's assume that Suzanne is right, that there's no need to take it off the table now. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1436.68s)]
*  There are no negotiations. Let's assume you did. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1444.0s)]
*  Soon you are going to enter a period of what Alivaz at the International Crisis Group calls no crisis, no deal. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1447.72s)]
*  That is what we're looking at in 2023. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1459.3600000000001s)]
*  We've not had a major confrontation with Iran over the nuclear issue or in the region, but there's now no diplomacy. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1462.64s)]
*  So it's that danger zone where the United States is going to have to figure out how to respond. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1471.5600000000002s)]
*  And we haven't the Israel word hasn't come up here yet. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1482.1599999999999s)]
*  But yesterday's events are going to bring to power a guy who anticipated has made much of his foreign policy chops on the Iran issue. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1486.12s)]
*  And while I'm not sure that's going to be his main priority for the first four or five months, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1500.6399999999999s)]
*  he'll come around to it again. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1509.04s)]
*  And I think that that plus the no crisis, no deal environment is going to begin to create. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1512.24s)]
*  Plus, if you're sitting Tehran and you're looking at what's happening in the streets and if Suzanne is right, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1521.16s)]
*  this is the beginning of the end of the end may take a very long time. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1526.8s)]
*  Robin Wright reminded me the other day that the Iranian Revolution played out over 14 months. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1531.28s)]
*  The Green Revolution started in June of nine and didn't conclude until, I guess, February of 2010. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1535.6399999999999s)]
*  We have months to go. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1543.28s)]
*  But if you're sitting Tehran, you're thinking, I'm not giving up this nuclear hedge. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1546.0s)]
*  This is the only thing that is going to make me relevant now. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1552.1599999999999s)]
*  And it's it's our ticket. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1556.6s)]
*  So add that to it. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1560.36s)]
*  The Israeli factor, no JCPOA. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1563.4799999999998s)]
*  And you have all of the ingredients for a potential. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1567.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't know, explosion. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1572.4799999999998s)]
*  So in this situation that Aaron just described, say a situation like this materializes a year from now, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1575.32s)]
*  does the military do the military options or does military coercion, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1584.08s)]
*  especially given that diplomacy is no longer in the forefront of the US approach? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1588.0s)]
*  Does military coercion come to take on a new and more important role in how the United States approaches Iran inevitably? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1593.88s)]
*  Or is there another is there an alternative? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1602.88s)]
*  Look, I think there has to be a military component to our strategy on Iran under the current circumstances. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1606.32s)]
*  That's always been the case. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1613.04s)]
*  It's more true today because of exactly the reasons that Aaron described. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1614.12s)]
*  Obviously, that's not the preference for the Biden administration. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1618.9199999999998s)]
*  And I think that's part of the reason why there has been this desire to avoid sort of walking away from from the diplomatic path, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1621.3999999999999s)]
*  in part because also because Iranians occasionally dangle the possibility. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1631.3999999999999s)]
*  I think I saw tweets from the foreign ministry today even suggesting we're very, very eager for a deal. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1635.6799999999998s)]
*  So every time that happens, I think there's there's always this hope that there's this kind of I don't want to say quick fix, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1641.0s)]
*  but at least a silver bullet which enables the United States government to put the Middle East and Iran on the back burner, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1647.08s)]
*  which has been the goal for at least a decade and has consistently been subverted by events within the Middle East. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1654.16s)]
*  This administration, more than any other, I think, is determined not to get it wrong and not to not to get sucked back in, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1660.48s)]
*  both for domestic political reasons, but also because there is now, I think, a clear and holistic and bipartisan understanding [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1667.2s)]
*  that the real challenges to American security no longer reside or begin or end in the Middle East. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1674.68s)]
*  But but, you know, sort of are focused on China and, of course, now Russia and the situation in Ukraine. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1679.24s)]
*  So, you know, I think that, you know, the danger of leaving diplomacy sort of in this ambiguous nebulous, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1686.88s)]
*  not high on the agenda, but still out there is that, you know, we will be yanked back and forth around this. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1695.12s)]
*  I think the most important aspect of a military strategy at this point on Iran is going to be signaling very clearly, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1700.96s)]
*  very publicly, at least on some aspects of it, what the red lines are that would precipitate a more focused American response. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1708.48s)]
*  I think, you know, one of the one of the downsides of what happened in 2020 was the Iranians apparently thought that they could get away [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1718.08s)]
*  with a lot more than than the Trump administration believed that they had communicated to Tehran was possible. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1725.24s)]
*  And they miscalculated and they that's always possible. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1731.52s)]
*  But I think in this case, especially around the nuclear issue, we want to make very clear what it is that would precipitate some kind of military response, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1735.3999999999999s)]
*  whether it's enrichment to 90 percent, whether it's completely throwing out the IAEA. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1741.8s)]
*  What are the things that are going to escalate this crisis in a way that's going to end very badly for Iran and frankly, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1746.68s)]
*  for the rest of the region and the rest of the world? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1753.0s)]
*  And the president needs to communicate that the president has said all options are on the table. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1755.08s)]
*  But that's very different than making clear what it is that would precipitate an American military response. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1759.64s)]
*  And frankly, Joe Biden is going to be much more credible on that topic than even Bibi Netanyahu will be. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1764.96s)]
*  And just to be clear, you're talking about red lines specifically with regard to the nuclear program, not other issues in Iran, such as protests. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1770.68s)]
*  I think primary is highly unlikely. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1777.44s)]
*  I could imagine a scenario that where we would respond to the domestic situation with a military response because it risks much greater civilian casualties than even the Iranian Revolutionary Guard are likely to perpetrate. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1780.24s)]
*  I think there are probably issues beyond the nuclear one. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1793.2s)]
*  Because we were talking about the nuclear issue, I think that's where I would start. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1796.88s)]
*  One of the challenges that we have had in part because of the focus on the nuclear issue over the course of the past 20 years has been that we have essentially at times turned a blind eye, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1801.96s)]
*  whether it was the killing of American soldiers in Iraq by Iranian IED, provided IEDs, Iranian trained and supplied IEDs or other other other provocations that have enabled the Iranians to further [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1810.84s)]
*  entrench their influence and capacity across the region. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1825.76s)]
*  It's not clear to me that there are that there are discrete areas where the Biden administration would seek to draw red lines with respect to the region. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1831.4s)]
*  But I imagine that's very situational and contextual. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1838.24s)]
*  And there may be cases where we would, in fact, want to make clear what wouldn't be tolerated with respect to Iranian intervention, whether it's in Iraq, Yemen or more dangerously in Lebanon and Syria. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1841.36s)]
*  OK, maybe it's good at this point if we talk a little bit about how American interests in or how you see American interests in Iran. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1855.44s)]
*  Henry, would you be willing to start us off? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1864.16s)]
*  And I mean, as you look out over the course of the next couple of years, what do you think? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1866.3200000000002s)]
*  Does America have any vital interests in Iran? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1870.96s)]
*  Let me just start with that. And if so, what are they? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1872.6000000000001s)]
*  And how would you characterize any secondary interests that the United States has? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1874.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I tend to see the kind of American interests in kind of three three buckets. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1878.88s)]
*  There's the nuclear program. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1884.2s)]
*  There's Iran's regional activity, non-nuclear. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1885.56s)]
*  And then you have domestic human rights related issues. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1888.3600000000001s)]
*  There might be others that I'm forgetting. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1892.44s)]
*  But those, I think, are the kind of main kind of categories. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1893.52s)]
*  And, you know, I think there's still a good argument to be made that the category that threatens the United States the most continues to would be the development of an Iranian nuclear weapon. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1896.3600000000001s)]
*  And that there is a reason that this kind of continues to be a preoccupation of American presidents and decision makers in trying to find ways to deny Iran that capability. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1906.8799999999999s)]
*  But, you know, policymaking is about is about prioritization. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1920.36s)]
*  And I think there's valid valid reasons to switch up the priorities. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1923.3999999999999s)]
*  But I think, you know, I think a lot of ways the, you know, changing changing the the the order here, removing nuclear from its kind of top of the top of the pyramid and putting human rights or regional issues, those do have have have have real tradeoffs. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1927.88s)]
*  I think are worth talking through. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1944.2s)]
*  You know, just just for instance, you know, I think it's very tough to imagine a world where the U.S. adopts a kind of full throated regime change type strategy. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1947.28s)]
*  And yes, there are other, you know, might have a nuclear component policy as well. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1958.3600000000001s)]
*  You might have regional policy. But if if regime change takes the kind of thrust of policy, I think that essentially removes the possibility of diplomatic options on the nuclear program, for instance. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1962.32s)]
*  So I think you we do need to be honest about how changing the the priority list does affect the options that that the United States has. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1973.32s)]
*  Do you do you agree, Suzanne, that the nuclear issue should remain the top priority when it comes to thinking about U.S. interests in Iran over the course of the next few years? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1982.24s)]
*  I think it has to occupy a centerpiece of our day to day concerns. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1990.68s)]
*  You know, for much of the past 20 years, it was sort of number one, two, three, four, five on the list of things that kept U.S. policy makers up at night. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=1995.8s)]
*  It's a little lower now, maybe. But, you know, it's still very much a real threat. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2004.08s)]
*  And it's something that we have to contend with. But I also think that we the context has changed radically. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2008.2s)]
*  And, you know, we have spent 40 years studying, watching what's happening in Iran. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2014.2s)]
*  And, you know, despite the fact that it's really still a partisan issue, most people on both sides of the aisle have sort of had come to this sort of understanding that Iran's a complicated place. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2019.68s)]
*  We thought there might be some prospects for change from within. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2030.44s)]
*  Many of us started to recognize that that change from within wasn't going to really happen. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2033.3600000000001s)]
*  But still, we thought we could do some things in diplomacy because Iranian leaders were rational actors. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2038.24s)]
*  And they, in fact, understood the cost benefit trade off of pursuing a policy that set them at odds with not just the United States, but with the wider world. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2045.24s)]
*  I think that context has changed. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2055.12s)]
*  They have concluded from the experience, not just from Trump withdrawing from the nuclear deal, but from what they've watched of American policy, the withdrawal from Afghanistan, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2058.08s)]
*  but they've watched of Chinese and Russian policy that they're going to throw their bets. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2066.56s)]
*  And this is the leadership, not the people. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2070.92s)]
*  They're going to throw their bets in with not with Europe, not with the United States, not with we need to get swift and ties to the international financial system dominated by the United States. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2072.56s)]
*  But we believe that there is another set of powers rising. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2083.04s)]
*  And in fact, our future stability as a country, our future prosperity as a country relies on looking east and investing there. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2086.6400000000003s)]
*  And so as a result of that, they're simply not persuaded that they need to take the actions that would be necessary to come to some kind of significant rapprochement or change in the relationship with Washington and with the West. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2094.72s)]
*  And I think we have to acknowledge that. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2107.7999999999997s)]
*  We also have to acknowledge that we no longer can approach the Iran issue as a coherent, multilateral set of great powers. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2109.3999999999996s)]
*  One of the amazing parts of the diplomacy that led to the JCPOA was this kind of unprecedented set of circumstances in which not just the United States and Europe banded together, which itself was unusual. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2117.08s)]
*  Most of the post-revolutionary period, Europe and the United States were on opposite sides of the argument on Iran. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2127.88s)]
*  But but from 2010 to 2015, you not only had the United States and Europe very coherent, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2134.24s)]
*  but you were able to sustain coherent, constructive diplomacy that involved the Russians and the Chinese, even at times of significant frictions between Washington and Moscow and Washington and Beijing, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2141.04s)]
*  even at times where the Russians were engaged in really nefarious actions, both in Syria and, of course, in in Ukraine. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2152.64s)]
*  That no longer exists. We cannot rely on the Russians as a partner on the nuclear issue. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2160.72s)]
*  We cannot rely on the Chinese as a partner on the nuclear issue. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2165.96s)]
*  And so our leverage is necessarily lesser. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2169.44s)]
*  Our ability to affect outcomes with respect to Iran with the Iranian government is necessarily lesser. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2172.08s)]
*  That's a very fascinating point that you make about the changing geopolitical context in which all of this is occurring. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2179.96s)]
*  Erin, you had actually raised earlier a related point about the end state here. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2187.88s)]
*  Let me ask you, if you were to look back on this conversation or where we are in the United States right now on Iran, say, five years from now, what would you consider a success? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2194.76s)]
*  I mean, when you think about U.S.-Iran policy, what would be a successful outcome of all of the effort that everyone is making on Iran? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2205.76s)]
*  Yeah, I'll answer that. But I just want to add one politically inconvenient reality to Suzanne's argument, because she's absolutely right. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2212.2000000000003s)]
*  It was a rare moment. It's not just the absence of multilateral cooperation. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2222.16s)]
*  In many respects, and I know it's politically inconvenient, we have seen the enemy and the enemy is us. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2227.08s)]
*  The reality is you cannot count on what's the date today? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2233.2799999999997s)]
*  It's November 3rd. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2237.48s)]
*  You cannot count on a continuity of American policy, either in tactics or in strategy. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2240.92s)]
*  Should the political wheel turn again in 2024? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2250.44s)]
*  In large part, we're having this conversation. Who knows what would have happened? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2254.92s)]
*  And it's counterfactual. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2259.44s)]
*  And I certainly don't want to write a brief for the Iranians, but who knows what would have happened had the previous administration not made a unilateral decision to walk away from the agreement? [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2262.2400000000002s)]
*  It was a flawed agreement, but it was functional. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2275.7200000000003s)]
*  It was designed to preempt an Israeli strike and to make an American military strike unnecessary. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2279.8s)]
*  Because people understood that it is the only issue in this region right now, as I can see, that could trigger a regional confrontation. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2285.88s)]
*  And from the standpoint of administration, trigger rising oil prices and plunging financial markets. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2295.84s)]
*  Not to mention regional turmoil, the possibility of an Israeli-Hezbollah confrontation. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2304.52s)]
*  So you can't count on, and neither could Iran count on, and that's also factored, I suspect, into their calculations. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2312.44s)]
*  The problem of American commitment is one that exists across all the issues that the United States is dealing with in its foreign policy right now. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2322.44s)]
*  And obviously, Iran is only one of the more important examples. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2328.72s)]
*  But let me ask you about this question. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2332.96s)]
*  What would success look like? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2334.76s)]
*  I mean, given the realities that we've been talking about, what would a successful Iran strategy have achieved in five years? [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2336.32s)]
*  Form follows function. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2342.48s)]
*  We have three cardinal interests, seems to me. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2344.0s)]
*  A fourth. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2347.64s)]
*  And I don't want to make it a fourth, because every human being represents a universe of possibility. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2348.44s)]
*  And we've got at least four dual nationals unfairly imprisoned, being used by the regime. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2355.16s)]
*  Getting them back has to be a priority. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2362.8799999999997s)]
*  In terms of what we must have as opposed to what it would be nice to have, vital versus discretionary, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2367.56s)]
*  I think at the top of the pile is an answer, at least to continue to constrain and restrain Iran's putative search, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2375.08s)]
*  well, Iran's nuclear program, both in developing enough fissile material to make nuclear weapons and then the more complex process of how to weaponize. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2385.3199999999997s)]
*  Physics package, the warhead, the delivery system, all of that. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2395.12s)]
*  It seems to me that is priority number one, because the other issues, access to oil at fair and reasonable prices, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2400.12s)]
*  maintaining support for our, I wouldn't call them allies, our partners in the Gulf, particularly Saudi Arabia, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2409.2s)]
*  and continuing to see hydrocarbons flow through that region is extremely important. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2416.4s)]
*  Checking Iran's regional ambitions, they have a demographic and geographic advantage that we do not have. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2422.72s)]
*  Iran is in that region. It's not going away. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2429.08s)]
*  I would argue that, you know, as the Arab world sort of enters periods of dysfunction, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Yemen, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2431.68s)]
*  it's the three non-Arabs, in my judgment, who represent the keepers, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2443.24s)]
*  the three states in this region that can project power, that have competent militaries and intelligence organizations, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2450.64s)]
*  and can project power for good or ill, Israel, Iran, and Turkey. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2459.4s)]
*  And Iran is one of those. Iran's a real country with an extraordinary past and extraordinary potential. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2464.68s)]
*  It could ever be unlocked and harnessed in the service of the vast majority of the Iranian public. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2472.92s)]
*  But from our standpoint, I think it's conflict prevention over the nuclear issue. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2480.4s)]
*  And that includes one other point, and that is nuclear proliferation by other states. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2486.84s)]
*  I'm going to hand the same question to Suzanne and Henry, but I want to note that we are starting to get some questions from our audience, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2492.4s)]
*  who obviously are virtual today, so I'm going to pick up my phone here and start reading some of these questions that come in. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2500.52s)]
*  But first, let me ask you, why don't we start with you, Henry? [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2505.4s)]
*  I mean, five years from now, basically, if I sort of summarize what Aaron seemed right now to be emphasizing, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2508.72s)]
*  it was that at a minimum, a realistic outcome could be one where Iran, there are still constraints on Iran's nuclear program, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2515.3999999999996s)]
*  and we've had the hostages returned, that there are a number of other issues which he listed, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2522.48s)]
*  which could be obviously things that would be desirable, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2527.48s)]
*  but you could still consider a U.S. strategy to Iran to have been successful if those first two objectives were achieved. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2530.44s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2536.7999999999997s)]
*  Yes, I agree. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2538.4s)]
*  Leave it at that. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2540.36s)]
*  Suzanne, how about you? [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2541.6800000000003s)]
*  How would you characterize a successful Iran strategy if you were looking back five years from now? [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2544.36s)]
*  Look, I think those are components of a successful Iran strategy for the United States, necessary components. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2550.7200000000003s)]
*  But I also, you know, I talked about the context changing geopolitically for our approach to Iran. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2557.6800000000003s)]
*  I think we have to recognize that, you know, unlike the intelligence community, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2564.08s)]
*  which did not assess Iran in a pre-revolutionary state, even as it was in a pre-revolutionary state, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2570.04s)]
*  we should now acknowledge that Iran is in a pre or revolutionary state. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2575.64s)]
*  What's happening on the ground is unprecedented. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2580.64s)]
*  It is truly historic and it is going to have long term consequences for the capability of this system. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2583.68s)]
*  I don't know what the trajectory of that political change within Iran will be, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2590.76s)]
*  but I think everything that we do in terms of our Iran strategy has to be predicated on a different set of assumptions than existed before the death of Mos Amini, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2595.6400000000003s)]
*  which was that Iran was a country of a very unhappy population, but a largely stable government. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2604.8s)]
*  That's no longer the case. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2611.6000000000004s)]
*  And, you know, again, you know, I think if we could rewind history and look at the period between 1977 and February 1979 [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2613.24s)]
*  and take different actions as a result of the understanding of what was coming over the pike, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2623.72s)]
*  I think that, you know, we should now be looking at Iran with a very different lens than we were looking at it until very recently, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2629.52s)]
*  with the recognition that what has been clear as a system that was ossifying, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2637.48s)]
*  and I think I used the word slow motion metastasis a couple of years ago, it's no longer slow motion. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2643.92s)]
*  This is a system that has lost legitimacy of a vast majority of its people and they are coming to the streets and the fear factor has been lost. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2650.0s)]
*  The cycle of protest and martyrdom has been reactivated just as it was in 78 and 79, and that is going to sustain a protest movement. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2657.84s)]
*  The protest movement is supplemented by acts of individual civil disobedience, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2666.92s)]
*  which are very powerful and have a corrosive effect on the security forces because you have in many cases conscripts [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2671.4s)]
*  who are having to decide whether they're going to beat and arrest individual women for removing their headscarf [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2677.84s)]
*  or simply a seed to what is the erosion of a core principle, the principle of hijab and Islamic dress code for women [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2683.48s)]
*  that has been core to the legitimacy of the Islamic Republic since its earliest days. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2691.2400000000002s)]
*  Civil disobedience supplemented by acts of sabotage, cyber attacks against the central bank, against the state broadcasting authority, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2696.28s)]
*  and potentially now still very small scale strikes in important industries. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2703.7200000000003s)]
*  All of this has the hallmarks of what we saw in the past, what we've seen in other parts of the world. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2710.2400000000002s)]
*  It does not have a leader, it does not have a destination in terms of what Iranians proactively want, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2715.32s)]
*  but they're very clear on what they don't want and that is the Islamic Republic. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2721.52s)]
*  But what does it mean in terms of US strategy, what you're laying out? [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2725.28s)]
*  I mean, does it mean that we should be in a holding pattern? [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2728.0400000000004s)]
*  I think it means we have to think very, very carefully about whether or not we can come to an agreement [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2731.7200000000003s)]
*  that would provide the Iranians with unfettered access to billions of dollars, [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2737.48s)]
*  both in terms of the reserves that they have accumulated in various banks outside the country, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2741.48s)]
*  as well as the continued access to oil sales, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2747.72s)]
*  licitly now if a deal were to be done on the open market at a time when oil prices are very high. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2751.7999999999997s)]
*  Is that providing essentially a life raft to a regime which is otherwise very much under fire from its own population? [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2757.9199999999996s)]
*  Is it reinvigorating all the very sorts of activities and behaviors and destabilizing tendencies of this regime [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2767.56s)]
*  that we have been trying to contend with and through other means? [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2775.64s)]
*  What is the probability that we are in fact going to be able to shift gears [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2779.7599999999998s)]
*  if we see the Iranians beginning to try to sneak out of their obligations under such a deal? [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2785.3599999999997s)]
*  And what is the probability that we're going to find ourselves with an even more hostile Middle East [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2791.56s)]
*  if we are appearing to reward a government that has been engaged in crimes against humanity, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2796.72s)]
*  against its own people and participating in a horrific and illegal war in Europe? [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2803.84s)]
*  So is the essential trade-off then that you're describing between potentially undermining the protests on the one hand [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2810.28s)]
*  and actually getting the guarantees against Iran moving towards a nuclear capability on the other? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2817.1600000000003s)]
*  Is that a big choice for the United States and its allies to be thinking about right now? [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2823.96s)]
*  I don't think the choices are actually in conflict because what we're seeing from Iran is not a government that wants to do a deal. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2829.4s)]
*  I mean, if Tehran were terribly concerned about getting the JCPOA back into force, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2836.6800000000003s)]
*  A, they would have taken the deal when it was first negotiated, which it's now been essentially ready to go for months. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2842.32s)]
*  And B, they wouldn't be providing offensive military capabilities to the Russians for use in Ukraine against civilian infrastructure there. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2850.8s)]
*  So I think it's clear the Iranian government has made its choice. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2859.2s)]
*  We have to sort of take the message. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2862.92s)]
*  Chris, I just posed a question and because I think Suzanne's right, there's a moral hazard here. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2867.24s)]
*  I don't think the Iranians are going to want to come back into the agreement. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2873.44s)]
*  Let's assume that we're right and they don't. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2876.7999999999997s)]
*  What are the other options for constraining or restraining Iran's nuclear program? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2880.16s)]
*  That gets you into the area of red lines and of using a... [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2887.44s)]
*  Well, it's putting on the table, I've heard this phrase a thousand times, a credible military option. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2899.1600000000003s)]
*  Credible military option, which would have to be reinforced without using it. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2908.84s)]
*  It would have to be reinforced with a variety of other instruments that would make it unmistakably because all options on the table, frankly, loses its meaning. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2914.84s)]
*  You'd have to basically have the president say that under no circumstances will we permit Iran to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2926.76s)]
*  And we are prepared to use military force in order to stop it. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2938.1200000000003s)]
*  But then you'd have to create a sort of substructure in order to demonstrate that you were serious about that. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2943.6s)]
*  What would you have to do? [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2950.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, and I'm not sure I agree with this. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2952.64s)]
*  The argument has been made that you can... [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2956.7999999999997s)]
*  And we're not subcontracting this out to the Israelis, by the way. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2960.4399999999996s)]
*  If there's going to be a military strike against Iran in an effort to deal with this issue. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2964.3599999999997s)]
*  And again, it's an option, not a solution, because the regime might survive. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2971.24s)]
*  It would accelerate Iran's desire for a weapon. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2976.6s)]
*  Others in the international community might stand behind it if the United States struck. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2979.8799999999997s)]
*  But is deterrence a possibility through exercises with... [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2985.0s)]
*  Well, largely, we'd have to rely on the Israelis. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2990.9599999999996s)]
*  We have exercises with the Israelis in terms of refueling their longer range aircraft. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2993.68s)]
*  I think we denied that we were actually doing it. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=2999.6s)]
*  But apparently, we've done it. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3003.2s)]
*  So we have a question from the audience. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3005.92s)]
*  We have a couple of different questions. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3007.64s)]
*  But one of them gets at this issue of the credibility of the US military option. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3008.52s)]
*  And I think, and correct me if I'm wrong, but there is certainly a credible US military option to support a limited Israeli strike, for example, against an Iranian nuclear facility. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3014.36s)]
*  But I think the question from the audience is whether or not, beyond that, the United States can actually make a credible commitment that it would use military force, beyond something very specific like that, given the history that we've had in the Middle East over the course of the last 20 years. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3025.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, this administration would be torn because it clearly has deprioritized the region. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3040.7599999999998s)]
*  Our own domestic dysfunction mandates that we... [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3046.76s)]
*  Governance is about choosing. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3050.28s)]
*  And with the rising China and the ongoing war in Ukraine, which appears to me is going to continue to be ongoing at some level, another military adventure, even if it was well planned and scoped out, is going to raise all kinds of concerns. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3051.6800000000003s)]
*  But we can't assume that the Biden administration's view of the world is going to be the next administration's view of the world. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3069.72s)]
*  It's unlikely to be, frankly. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3077.4s)]
*  Henry, do you agree with that? [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3080.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3081.68s)]
*  So, I mean, I think both in the world that Suzanne laid out and I think in the world that I was talking more about where we were kind of closing the door for now on, or Iran has already closed the door on diplomacy or in a world where we want to leave that option open a bit. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3082.3199999999997s)]
*  I think consistent with both of these is putting forward and making more credible a military option. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3095.08s)]
*  I think we should be clear about the words we're using, credible military option. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3101.96s)]
*  The military option exists. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3105.12s)]
*  I don't think... [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3106.68s)]
*  I would bet there aren't many in the Iranian leadership who doubt American capability to do what American presidents have consistently said that they would do, though it gets harder over time with Iranian defenses, but American offenses improve as well. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3107.56s)]
*  I think the real question is around the credibility of it. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3119.88s)]
*  And I think there's very little that the US can do to convince Iran that change their view that America is a declining power, morally depraved, all the kind of propaganda that comes out. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3122.72s)]
*  But I do think there are things that the US can do to change the specific calculus that the... [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3132.08s)]
*  which I think the perception is probably today that the credibility of the American military threat is very low. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3137.48s)]
*  And I think in terms of exercises, in terms of forward deploying certain assets, or at least in terms of responding to Iranian regional activity in ways that are perhaps unpredictable or asymmetric, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3144.0s)]
*  in ways that Iran might not expect as a way to try to adjust that calculus of what the US would or would not do. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3156.36s)]
*  And I think that it has to be paired with some kind of red lines to be clear that these are certain sets of activity we can debate if there's better to communicate this publicly or privately, that would cause us to move more into that direction. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3164.08s)]
*  But I think regardless of which direction we see, whether we see the protests moving in a direction that will end at some point in revolution, whether they will end up in something more approximating the status quo ante, [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3178.0s)]
*  I think this policy, this approach is consistent with all of those different eventualities. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3192.96s)]
*  Suzanne, this is a question from our audience. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3200.08s)]
*  Do implicit or especially explicit US military threats tend to take the wind out of the protest movement? [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3204.2400000000002s)]
*  In other words, especially if the United States or Israel were to use military force in some way in Iran, would that undermine the protest? [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3215.6s)]
*  Is that a challenge that policymakers need to be thinking about? [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3222.6s)]
*  And is there a way in which Iran could use that as a strategy of its own, for example, potentially by accelerating its nuclear program in a way so as to provoke a strike as an effort to try to, as the person who asked the question put it, provoke a rally around the flag effect in Iran? [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3227.16s)]
*  Look, I think the government is capable of a lot of things, and I do think we have to be on guard for efforts to distract the public from what's happening on the streets by creating a crisis somewhere else. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3244.48s)]
*  I tend to think it's probably not with a massive acceleration of the nuclear program. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3258.2s)]
*  I think we've already seen a higher tempo of strikes in Kurdistan. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3263.64s)]
*  I think it's possible. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3269.52s)]
*  You know, there were there were reports last night that Iran that there might be some direct threat against territorial Saudi Arabia, which we've seen in the past, obviously, in terms of the upcake attack. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3270.88s)]
*  So I think that, you know, something like that is entirely possible. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3283.0s)]
*  I would tend to think it would happen. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3285.96s)]
*  It would probably be more aimed at Kurdistan than the Saudis, because I think they understand that the Saudi route brings the United States at least to the table in some more direct fashion. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3287.4s)]
*  But I don't think it actually is likely to kind of sap what is at this point, I think a movement that has some self-sustaining momentum among young primarily among young Iranians. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3299.52s)]
*  I mean, this is this is a movement that appears to be driven by people who the Iranian equivalent of Generation Z. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3313.52s)]
*  They are fed up with the entire system. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3322.64s)]
*  They want it's not a it's not a factional debate. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3324.64s)]
*  It's not even a personal animosity, although obviously there's a lot of and many toward Hominid himself. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3327.56s)]
*  There's just a desire for normalcy and for the whole system to be gone. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3334.7599999999998s)]
*  And I think even as we saw in 2020, there was a you know, the regime is always able to pull people to the streets. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3339.56s)]
*  I've seen it in person. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3347.36s)]
*  They're very good at getting their supporters out. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3348.48s)]
*  Often it's you know, it's there's a financial incentive to participate in some of those pro regime rallies. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3350.72s)]
*  But even, you know, within the weeks after the Sulaimani, you know, they had done that in the aftermath of the targeted strike that took out Sulaimani, [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3357.04s)]
*  the downing of the of the aircraft, the civilian aircraft, then led very quickly to anti-regime protests. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3365.64s)]
*  So I don't think at this point, the orchestration of, you know, sort of any kind of outrage at the United States, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3372.24s)]
*  I don't think they're going to be able to redirect the anger of the people who've been willing to come to the streets knowing that they're taking their lives in their hands. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3381.44s)]
*  Do you agree? [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3388.96s)]
*  There's no way to know, but I trust Suzanne's judgment on this. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3391.04s)]
*  Yeah. You know, thinking through a military option, you know, I think Frank McKenzie, former head of CENTCOM, made a comment that this may have been in private. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3393.88s)]
*  The whole purpose of CENTCOM was Iran, Iran, Iran. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3405.88s)]
*  So there obviously are all kinds of scenarios and planning being done for such a thing. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3408.8s)]
*  You know, the Israelis struck twice once in 1981 against an Iraqi reactor and then again in 2007 against a Syrian reactor. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3416.2400000000002s)]
*  Those are isolated, discrete, discrete strikes. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3424.88s)]
*  Surprise clearly was a huge advantage. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3427.84s)]
*  The Israelis were operating well within their capacity. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3432.84s)]
*  You think about what a military strike against Iran would mean with sites that are dispersed throughout the country, [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3437.04s)]
*  country buried within, you know, scores of meters of concrete. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3444.96s)]
*  You'd have to suppress Iran's conventional air defense system. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3451.24s)]
*  You're going to have civilian casualties. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3457.68s)]
*  It wouldn't be a limited strike. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3460.6s)]
*  It would be a variation, I suspect, of shock and awe. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3464.52s)]
*  And the consequences, I don't know much about radiation leaks or what the environmental consequences would be of such a strike. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3470.6s)]
*  But the anticipation would have to be that it would also lead to confusion, uncertainty and cracks, perhaps within the regime. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3481.24s)]
*  But that has to be balanced against the real rally around the flag effect if your country is attacked by another. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3492.2s)]
*  You can see why, as limited and as imperfect the instrument as diplomacy actually is, why it was such a powerful, so attractive. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3502.2s)]
*  Because again, I'm back to the issue of end state. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3517.88s)]
*  Once scientific knowledge enters the head, figuratively speaking, of an entire society, how do you deal with that? [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3521.04s)]
*  Iran knows how to, they know and they have the capability to make enough fissile material. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3531.2799999999997s)]
*  And what if the other point I wanted to make is what are our eyes like now on Iran's nuclear sites? [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3537.16s)]
*  What is the possibility that they've diverted enough fissile material to an undeclared site somewhere and they're in the process of assembling, they want to become a latent nuclear power? [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3546.52s)]
*  That is to say they have all the elements of assembly of what is required. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3556.96s)]
*  I mean, how do we know that this, particularly against the protests, that this hasn't already been in train? [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3563.92s)]
*  Is there a scenario where pressure on the regime continues and ultimately the regime fractures in some kind of a way and Iran's nuclear program continues or even accelerates? [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3572.52s)]
*  Or is the assumption that any change in Iran is going to have positive repercussions for our objectives with regard to its nuclear program? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3587.64s)]
*  It depends on the time frame. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3597.8s)]
*  I mean, I personally, from my experience in Iran, I genuinely believe that this is a country that is well positioned to eventually come to a transition and be a fully formed democracy in the Middle East in a way that we simply don't have anywhere outside of, at this point, Israel. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3599.4s)]
*  The short term scenarios could be ugly. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3617.32s)]
*  Certainly. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3619.52s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3620.28s)]
*  I mean, we could see a scenario in which the military takes over and it's a, you know, it's a very, very difficult situation. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3620.96s)]
*  You know, the same thugocracy without the kind of Islamic veneer. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3627.44s)]
*  You know, we don't know in part because we haven't seen anything like this in Iran in 43 years. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3632.7200000000003s)]
*  But, you know, I think that we have to be prepared for any eventuality and we have to be cautious about the kind of rose colored glasses that come along with what are, you know, this message of incredible hope and [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3641.4s)]
*  optimism, I think, coming from the streets of people who really do want to create a better future for their country. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3657.0s)]
*  This is a leadership that has done everything to cling to power in every shape and form. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3664.72s)]
*  I mean, do you do you agree with that? [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3670.7999999999997s)]
*  Do you think that there's a real possibility that could completely overturn basically and make irrelevant most of the strategies that the United States has pursued with Iran over the course of the last four years? [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3672.48s)]
*  Yeah, I think that all, you know, not to not to use the same phrase, but all options are on the table in that sense in terms of a range of different outcomes that could come out of this. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3683.36s)]
*  And you could see very different, you know, the as you all know, and as many of our viewers know, the Shah had a robust nuclear program. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3694.24s)]
*  So the idea that a change in regime would kind of wipe clean the motivations that still exist for some kind of Iranian government to pursue nuclear weapons, I think it's it's it's it's been quite [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3703.4s)]
*  clear that you could end up with a with a perfectly pro-Western friendly democratic Iran that that makes its own choice in that direction, too. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3718.92s)]
*  So I think there are a lot of different a lot of different permutations of this that that will demand some, you know, humility and some creative thinking. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3726.0s)]
*  Could you end up with a serious scenario? [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3735.28s)]
*  Sure. I think my my expectation for the kind of if if there were to be a, you know, overthrow of the government within a within a medium kind of period of time is I think things end up much more in the direction of [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3738.2400000000002s)]
*  Revolutionary Guard dominated state to the extent that it's that it's not already and and and and not into a, you know, quote unquote, better situation. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3755.52s)]
*  So I think the I you know, there is a possibility of kind of to break down of of of of of of government. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3764.64s)]
*  But I think it's more likely that, you know, in the in the decision tree between, you know, status quo and some kind of change, I think that some kind of change more likely than not in the near term would [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3773.96s)]
*  end up in in probably a much worse place, even if at the end of this process, as Suzanne has said, you end up in a in a more positive environment. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3784.4399999999996s)]
*  Aaron, do you have a final thought for us as we conclude here? [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3796.6s)]
*  No, I mean, I'd like to be hopeful. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3800.0s)]
*  I I quote Jack Kennedy, who described himself as an idealist without illusions. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3802.24s)]
*  I think that reflects, I think, Suzanne's optimism as well as Henry's realism. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3809.52s)]
*  And I think that's where that's where we should be. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3816.64s)]
*  We really, though, have to look at the world the way it is. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3821.0s)]
*  If we ever want to have any chance of helping to change it the way we would, we would want it to be. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3824.44s)]
*  And that means a cruel and unforgiving assessment of the limitations of American power, but also where, in fact, we can project our power and a even crueler, unforgiving, realistic assessment of why and how things change in societies like Iran. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3832.64s)]
*  Because I think we tend to we tend to, I guess, create our own sorts of modes of analysis and impose them. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3852.44s)]
*  And we that's why we've kind of been for most of the last 50, 60 years in this region, a kind of modern day gulliver wandering around in a world that we don't understand, tied up by a lot of smaller powers whose interests, frankly, do not coincide with ours across the board and burdened by our own illusions. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3862.12s)]
*  If the analysis would be better and serve the policymakers and their judgment would be generated by wisdom and prudence, maybe we'd have a chance of really projecting American power. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3883.12s)]
*  Well, we can we can certainly hope for that. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3897.0s)]
*  And I hope that with minds like your three, we can push the ball in Washington in that direction. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3899.16s)]
*  Thank you enormously for your time. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3907.08s)]
*  It's been a really interesting discussion for me and one that I hope our viewers have have benefited from as well. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3909.1600000000003s)]
*  Thanks, you all, for joining us this this afternoon here in Washington. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ktcAo9A9A&t=3915.28s)]
