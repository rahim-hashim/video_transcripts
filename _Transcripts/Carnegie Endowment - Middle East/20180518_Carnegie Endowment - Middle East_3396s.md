# Whatâ€™s Next After the Iran Deal
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [May 18, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g)
*  You okay? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=0.0s)]
*  Great. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1.6400000000000001s)]
*  Thanks for coming in on a miserably rainy Friday. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2.92s)]
*  And we have, as you know, the topic, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=7.48s)]
*  and I'm sure you know our panelists as well, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=9.8s)]
*  who are now all here at Carnegie. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna jump right into the conversation, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=14.32s)]
*  but we will have some Q&A at the back end. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=16.18s)]
*  So we'll be running a microphone around the room. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  So when we get to that portion, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=22.36s)]
*  if you just say your name and your affiliation [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=23.8s)]
*  before you ask your question, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=25.92s)]
*  that will help us out a little bit. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=27.48s)]
*  Thank you all. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=30.76s)]
*  My first question, Jake, how much did you drink [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=32.12s)]
*  when the announcement came out? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  You know, one of the funny things about [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=39.28s)]
*  the growing chorus of voices attacking the deal [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=41.24s)]
*  first through the Republican primary [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=47.44s)]
*  then Trump on the campaign trail [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=49.24s)]
*  and then in the weeks leading up to the announcement [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  was it started to get my family members calling me [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=52.56s)]
*  and saying, are they right? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=54.84s)]
*  Is this a really horrible deal? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=56.24s)]
*  Is this the worst deal ever negotiated [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=57.64s)]
*  in human history? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=59.6s)]
*  So you know, I was pretty disturbed, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  not just because Trump ripped up the deal [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=64.36s)]
*  or ripped up America's commitment to the deal, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=67.72s)]
*  but the way that he did it was so vehement. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  It went over the top, way beyond, I think, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=74.04s)]
*  what many of our partners were expecting. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  I think they thought he wouldn't renew the waivers, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=79.4s)]
*  but we'd continue talking about where this might end up, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=81.76s)]
*  and instead it was a full-on blast, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=84.72s)]
*  screed saying, we are out, we're done, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=89.92s)]
*  and all of you people are falling in line [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  and we're going back to a maximum pressure campaign. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=94.8s)]
*  That caught most people by surprise, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=98.62s)]
*  even me to a certain extent, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=100.84s)]
*  and I think it's put us in a very difficult position [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=102.84s)]
*  at this point. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=106.28s)]
*  Well, I will say, I mean, up to the last minute, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=107.44s)]
*  our European partners thought that the other scenario [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=110.12s)]
*  might be the case, that there still was a window [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=113.46s)]
*  for opportunity to negotiate something by that Friday, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=115.69999999999999s)]
*  the side deal, and it was a surprise [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=118.94s)]
*  to have the president announce what he did. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=122.05999999999999s)]
*  Of course, it's not a surprise in some ways [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=124.38s)]
*  because the president was pretty transparent [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=128.14s)]
*  when he campaigned. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=130.18s)]
*  He thought it was the worst deal ever [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=131.57999999999998s)]
*  and promised to do what he just did. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=133.01999999999998s)]
*  The execution and how it went down, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=135.94s)]
*  did that surprise you, that this was, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=138.94s)]
*  I mean, do you consider this the hard exit [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=140.9s)]
*  as described? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=142.98s)]
*  I'll tell you, the thing that surprised me most [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=144.5s)]
*  about the speech wasn't the nine minutes and 30 seconds [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=147.7s)]
*  in which he was trashing the Iranian regime [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=150.5s)]
*  and trashing the deal. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=152.26s)]
*  It was the final 10, 15 seconds in which he said [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=153.57999999999998s)]
*  to the leadership in Iran, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=157.57999999999998s)]
*  when you are ready to renegotiate this deal, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=159.22s)]
*  I am ready, willing, and able. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=162.33999999999997s)]
*  And one thing I think about Trump is that in contrast [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=164.54s)]
*  to some of his cabinet members [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=168.1s)]
*  or some of his advisors like John Bolton, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=170.01999999999998s)]
*  I don't think the president is particularly ideological [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=173.26s)]
*  or dogmatic when it comes to Iran or other issues. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=176.02s)]
*  He's a Groucho Marxist, some might say, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=180.22s)]
*  these are my principles and if you don't like them, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=183.38s)]
*  I got some other ones for you. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=184.98000000000002s)]
*  But he, as in the past, showed actually a willingness [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=187.26s)]
*  to engage directly with Iran's leadership. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=190.82s)]
*  It wasn't widely reported in the press, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=194.02s)]
*  but in September, last September, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=196.5s)]
*  during the UN General Assembly, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=198.74s)]
*  he had actually invited President Rouhani for dinner. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=200.58s)]
*  I was told, actually, this news was first broken [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=204.14000000000001s)]
*  by the Iranian press to say that the Iranians refused [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=207.02s)]
*  Trump's overtures. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=210.06s)]
*  Washington Post briefly reported it as well. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=211.14000000000001s)]
*  And I was told by an aide to President Rouhani [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=213.5s)]
*  that Rouhani actually wanted to take the meeting, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=216.02s)]
*  but he was prohibited to do so by the Supreme Leader. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=217.70000000000002s)]
*  So my sense is that to the extent there is a strategy, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=220.34s)]
*  it's to exact as much pressure as possible [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=225.34s)]
*  to kind of force two possible outcomes. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=228.42s)]
*  One is a renegotiation of the deal [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=231.5s)]
*  and the second is a potential implosion [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=234.73999999999998s)]
*  of the Iranian regime. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=237.06s)]
*  And again, my sense is that, to quote Richard Nephew a few, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=238.7s)]
*  if this was called the TCPA, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=244.61999999999998s)]
*  the Trump Comprehensive Plan of Action, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=246.38s)]
*  it'd probably be far more amenable to the current deal. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=248.61999999999998s)]
*  And he would perhaps renegotiate an even less favorable deal [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=252.73999999999998s)]
*  to the United States if it had his imprimatur on it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=257.3s)]
*  So I don't have confidence that we'll be able [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=260.1s)]
*  to renegotiate a better deal with a far smaller coalition, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=262.46000000000004s)]
*  but I think that that potentially is one of his goals. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=268.38s)]
*  Derek, can you talk about where we are [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=273.18s)]
*  with the deal that remains right now? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=274.66s)]
*  Because there's a lot of noise in Europe, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=277.14s)]
*  a lot of sort of diplomatic entreaties [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=279.14s)]
*  to put something in place to try to keep the architecture [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=282.42s)]
*  still functioning, keep the Iranians still in it, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=286.54s)]
*  but then privately even the Europeans say, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=289.98s)]
*  this is a flawed way to preserve what was a really, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=292.26000000000005s)]
*  if not fatal, very damaging blow from the United States. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=298.66s)]
*  Sure, for the record, I would like to say [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=302.46000000000004s)]
*  that there was actually an article in the FP on Friday [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=304.14000000000004s)]
*  about how much some of us drank the night after, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=306.82000000000005s)]
*  so if anyone's interested. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=308.70000000000005s)]
*  It's a serious question. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=310.5s)]
*  I know how hard you guys worked on this. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=311.70000000000005s)]
*  So my view is that the JCPOA, as we negotiated it, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=314.65999999999997s)]
*  as we implemented it, is dead. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=320.53999999999996s)]
*  It was an agreement fundamentally [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=322.82s)]
*  between the United States and Iran. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=324.34s)]
*  90% of the benefits Iran anticipated receiving [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=325.9s)]
*  from the JCPOA are dependent upon US compliance [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=328.98s)]
*  with our commitments. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=333.38s)]
*  So the idea that Europe can preserve the JCPOA, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=335.02s)]
*  I think, deserves the skepticism that it's received. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=338.53999999999996s)]
*  I don't actually think that that's the conversation [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=341.7s)]
*  going on between the E3 Iran, Russia, and China at this stage. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=344.26s)]
*  I think that that conversation is about the possibility [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=348.7s)]
*  of a rump JCPOA where some of the benefits [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=351.86s)]
*  Iran anticipated are preserved [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=356.21999999999997s)]
*  by aggressive anti-sanction action, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=358.41999999999996s)]
*  whether it's from the E3 or China, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=361.74s)]
*  and some of the benefits that cannot be preserved [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=364.34s)]
*  are replaced, and finally, Iran accepts [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=366.78s)]
*  some diminution of their expected profit from the deal, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=370.42s)]
*  which frankly they're already dealing with it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=374.62s)]
*  They never got quite what they wanted out of it. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=377.26s)]
*  And I think that that prospect deserves [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=379.3s)]
*  much less skepticism, and that the fact is [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=382.62s)]
*  the US has never really tested our secondary sanctions tool [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=386.46000000000004s)]
*  against resolute opposition from our European allies. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=389.70000000000005s)]
*  And should there be the shape of a deal [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=394.06s)]
*  that satisfies Europe and satisfies Iran, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=396.58000000000004s)]
*  is sufficient to prompt the Europeans [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=398.62s)]
*  to look at the whole space, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=401.86s)]
*  the reposition of secondary sanctions on Iran, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=403.82s)]
*  the steel and aluminum tariffs, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=407.22s)]
*  the Russia sanctions and say, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=409.02s)]
*  Washington is behaving as a haphazard manner [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=411.46s)]
*  that is not in line with our interests, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=413.7s)]
*  and we are going to confront on this point. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=415.3s)]
*  I think that that is not likely, but plausible. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=418.02s)]
*  So when you talk, though, to the Europeans, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=421.86s)]
*  they are still trying to keep some of this together. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=425.9s)]
*  When you say a rump JCPOA, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=429.34s)]
*  like what enforcement mechanisms will there still be? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=432.06s)]
*  So I think that the idea would be that [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=436.94s)]
*  as much as possible of Iran's commitments [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=439.02s)]
*  are preserved as they are, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=441.46s)]
*  in exchange for different concessions [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=443.34s)]
*  from mainly the EU3 in China. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=445.85999999999996s)]
*  Such as? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=448.41999999999996s)]
*  Well, so you've seen today, actually, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=449.82s)]
*  there was an announcement out of Sophia [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=451.53999999999996s)]
*  about the EU summit. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=454.22s)]
*  A lot of focus has been on the first part [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=456.34000000000003s)]
*  of that announcement, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=457.98s)]
*  which is that they're gonna relaunch the blocking statute. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=458.94s)]
*  In some ways, I think that's actually [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=462.5s)]
*  the least important thing. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=463.5s)]
*  The most important thing was the fourth part [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=464.58s)]
*  of the announcement, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=466.3s)]
*  which is that all member states of the EU [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=467.14s)]
*  are encouraged to find ways [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=469.38s)]
*  to make one-off banking transactions [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=471.46000000000004s)]
*  with the central bank of Iran, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=473.5s)]
*  principally for the support of oil purchases. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=475.3s)]
*  And I believe that there are technical ways [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=478.26s)]
*  that you could do that, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=480.3s)]
*  that would make US sanctions essentially impossible. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=481.18s)]
*  And that sustaining oil purchases from Iran, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=484.90000000000003s)]
*  China, India, EU, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=489.94s)]
*  would be so important for Iran's economy. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=493.06s)]
*  Because remember that without those oil purchases, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=495.62s)]
*  Iran is in depression. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=497.98s)]
*  With those oil purchases, Iran's not rolling in money, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=498.98s)]
*  but they're not in depression. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=501.22s)]
*  That some kind of deal that has elements like that, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=503.34000000000003s)]
*  and then more political elements, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=506.06s)]
*  like another part of the announcement, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=507.26s)]
*  partnership between Iran and the European Investment Bank. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=509.53999999999996s)]
*  I think that's the shape of what a Rump JCPOA would look like. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=513.22s)]
*  When you were involved in the early diplomacy, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=517.8199999999999s)]
*  and I know you stayed very much in contact [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=522.22s)]
*  in the final bits of it, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=525.26s)]
*  but weren't directly involved [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=527.18s)]
*  in the final round of negotiations, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=528.66s)]
*  was there ever any thought of one of the partners exiting, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=531.3s)]
*  or was it always the possibility of Iran [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=534.38s)]
*  being the one to break the terms? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=537.22s)]
*  Well, the Iranians themselves were quite concerned [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=538.98s)]
*  about the upcoming presidential election in 2016, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=540.9s)]
*  even when we started the conversation. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=543.62s)]
*  And frankly, at that point, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=545.3000000000001s)]
*  they weren't thinking about Donald Trump, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=547.62s)]
*  but they were thinking about a Republican party [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=548.94s)]
*  that had state early vigorous opposition [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=550.74s)]
*  to anything resembling the Iran deal. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=554.0600000000001s)]
*  And they were worried about Hillary Clinton, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=556.98s)]
*  who they regarded as someone much more hawkish on Iran [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=558.98s)]
*  than President Obama. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=561.98s)]
*  And so they consistently raised the question [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=563.86s)]
*  through 2013, 2014, and into 2015 [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=566.5s)]
*  about what happens if we get an American president [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=570.7s)]
*  who decides to walk away from this thing. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=574.58s)]
*  What did you say? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=575.98s)]
*  And frankly, we have to say, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=576.82s)]
*  this is a risk you're going to have to take. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=579.14s)]
*  If you make a good deal, and you comply with the deal, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=581.62s)]
*  and the deal is delivering, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=584.82s)]
*  then we think in the end it will endure. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=586.1s)]
*  But we can't make a promise to you long term, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=590.06s)]
*  because fundamentally the JCPOA [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=594.14s)]
*  is called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action for a reason. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=596.66s)]
*  It's not a treaty, it's not an agreement, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=599.66s)]
*  it's a plan of action. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=601.14s)]
*  And the commitments on both sides [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=602.78s)]
*  were fundamentally politically binding, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=604.6999999999999s)]
*  but not legally binding commitment. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=606.5s)]
*  So this was always in contemplation. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=608.1s)]
*  I think what has been so surprising [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=614.02s)]
*  about what the United States has done though, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=616.38s)]
*  is that they've decided to exit in a way [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=619.22s)]
*  where just think about what Jared just laid out. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=622.54s)]
*  That sounds sort of technical and technocratic, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=626.0999999999999s)]
*  but what it fundamentally means [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=628.62s)]
*  is the United States and Europe right now [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=629.6999999999999s)]
*  are in a real crisis. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=632.4599999999999s)]
*  You have the EU leaders gathering to basically say, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=636.8199999999999s)]
*  how do we screw the US in their stated policy [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=640.8199999999999s)]
*  in order to help Iran? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=644.62s)]
*  That's where we are today. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=647.8199999999999s)]
*  I think nobody quite contemplated [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=649.3399999999999s)]
*  that we would arrive at this place, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=651.02s)]
*  that the US would be so much at odds [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=653.14s)]
*  with its closest allies and negotiating partners [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=655.14s)]
*  over the future of the JCPOA, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=658.14s)]
*  because from our negotiating partners perspective, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=661.22s)]
*  Iran's complying and doing everything it said, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=664.22s)]
*  and the US departure is, while technically allowed, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=666.74s)]
*  a fundamentally bad faith move from their perspective. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=673.22s)]
*  From the Trump administration's perspective, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=675.6600000000001s)]
*  what they would argue, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=677.7s)]
*  and it's something that you heard the Israelis argue too, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=678.5400000000001s)]
*  is that doesn't matter, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=681.14s)]
*  because America, what we do, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=683.06s)]
*  is really what's going to set the terms for everyone else. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=686.02s)]
*  The dollar's still prime currency, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=689.5s)]
*  no one's gonna choose to do business with Iran [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=691.5s)]
*  over doing business with us, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=693.58s)]
*  that you gotta fall in line. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=695.26s)]
*  The Europeans protest, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=697.78s)]
*  but not so much as to truly damage relations. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=699.66s)]
*  They complain, but they basically think, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=703.22s)]
*  the Trump administration, they can walk it off. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=705.8199999999999s)]
*  Look, having been part of the effort [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=707.98s)]
*  to build this global coalition of sanctions [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=710.62s)]
*  in the first place, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=713.34s)]
*  and we went around all of the major capitals [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=714.16s)]
*  to help bring them on board, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=716.02s)]
*  not just the Europeans and the Chinese, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=717.7s)]
*  but the Indians and the South Africans, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=719.38s)]
*  the Japanese, the South Koreans, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=721.14s)]
*  every significant purchaser of Iran. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=723.34s)]
*  What became apparent is that sanctions work best [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=726.58s)]
*  if they're a combination of coercion, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=729.5s)]
*  the US says, we've got a strong tool here, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=731.34s)]
*  and cooperation. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=734.62s)]
*  Other countries say, okay, we'll work with you [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=735.74s)]
*  in a way that is most effective to achieve the goal, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=738.22s)]
*  but also not so disruptive to us. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=741.66s)]
*  If you drop the cooperative aspect, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=744.14s)]
*  and sanctions become a purely coercive tool, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=745.9s)]
*  they will be leakier, there will be more cheating, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=748.58s)]
*  there will be less aggressive compliance. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=752.26s)]
*  So for example, on the letter of the law, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=755.38s)]
*  Europe wasn't obliged back in 2011, 2012, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=759.0600000000001s)]
*  to go to zero oil purchases. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=762.34s)]
*  They chose to do so because we were working together. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=764.6s)]
*  Now, maybe they'll comply with the letter of the law, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=768.24s)]
*  maybe not, as Jarrett said, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=772.2s)]
*  they may find ways around it, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=773.36s)]
*  but they're gonna do the minimum, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=774.6s)]
*  and they're gonna do it slowly, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=775.96s)]
*  and they're gonna drag their feet, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=777.24s)]
*  and they're gonna find some ways [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=778.46s)]
*  to kind of test the US willingness [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=780.8000000000001s)]
*  to actually bring the hammer down, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=783.44s)]
*  and the Chinese even more so. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=785.3000000000001s)]
*  The idea that we are going to be able [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=788.64s)]
*  to reconstruct sanctions at the same level, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=790.5s)]
*  even with this aggressive chest feeding, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=792.8s)]
*  it's us or them, I think it's a flawed concept [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=795.56s)]
*  that the administration is pursuing. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=800.4399999999999s)]
*  It will be interesting to see [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=806.78s)]
*  if there's a bit of a sanctions arms race here, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=808.16s)]
*  because the more aggressive the US is [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=809.9s)]
*  in telling the Europeans, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=812.28s)]
*  basically we have you under our thumb, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=813.8s)]
*  the more the Europeans are gonna say, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=816.0s)]
*  we're applying to any means we possibly can [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=818.04s)]
*  to not let you do that to us, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=821.1999999999999s)]
*  and then the Americans will say, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=822.9599999999999s)]
*  well now we gotta make our thumb bigger to cover you, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=824.28s)]
*  and so on, and I think we could be headed [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=826.9599999999999s)]
*  for a very difficult period ahead [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=829.68s)]
*  as the rhetoric ratchets up on both sides [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=831.64s)]
*  and positions harden, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=833.68s)]
*  and meanwhile, all anyone is thinking about [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=834.9599999999999s)]
*  is sort of what's going on in Washington, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=838.52s)]
*  they're not thinking about what's going on in Tehran, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=842.06s)]
*  or in Damascus, or in Beirut, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=844.8399999999999s)]
*  or all the places that the Trump administration [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=846.68s)]
*  says they're really worried about. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=848.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=850.16s)]
*  I just think that the one thing that we know [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=851.9599999999999s)]
*  about the reimposition of these sanctions [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=854.9599999999999s)]
*  is that they will result in less leverage, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=856.68s)]
*  less pressure than the original sanctions did, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=859.04s)]
*  because whether there is sort of a full-scale defiance [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=861.76s)]
*  from allies and partners or not, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=865.8399999999999s)]
*  there isn't going to be this broad coalition [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=868.4399999999999s)]
*  that says, no, we agree, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=870.4399999999999s)]
*  there's a real national security problem here, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=871.36s)]
*  an international security problem, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=873.0799999999999s)]
*  and the US has got a plan to solve it, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=874.12s)]
*  and we're gonna stick with them. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=875.6s)]
*  So the scenario I laid out, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=877.0s)]
*  I'm certainly not laying out as the most likely scenario, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=880.64s)]
*  I think a very, very likely scenario [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=883.06s)]
*  is that these Europe-Iran negotiations fail, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=884.96s)]
*  Iran resumes something like industrial-scale enrichment, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=888.12s)]
*  and we don't have the capacity to rebuild the leverage [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=891.64s)]
*  and the international architecture [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=896.3s)]
*  to really impose costs on that decision. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=898.32s)]
*  Karim, pick up on that. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=900.92s)]
*  Do you actually see the Iranian threat [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=902.28s)]
*  of restarting as real, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=903.92s)]
*  but also can you put into context, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=905.66s)]
*  because what you hear to a certain degree [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=907.86s)]
*  from French officials, you hear different things, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=910.86s)]
*  depending on who you're talking to, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=913.14s)]
*  but you hear from Macron certain things about, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=914.42s)]
*  well, President Trump is right, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=917.02s)]
*  there is a certain sort of sensitive moment [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=919.42s)]
*  we're at within Iran. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=921.5799999999999s)]
*  Look at the economic protests you saw a few months ago, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=922.86s)]
*  you also hear from State Department officials. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=925.06s)]
*  That maybe the chemistry of the moment [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=927.5799999999999s)]
*  makes all of this add up in a different way, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=930.5s)]
*  that really Iran is at some breaking point, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=932.42s)]
*  and what Jake sketched out as sort of leakier [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=934.54s)]
*  is actually coming at a point [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=938.06s)]
*  where it will be a blow to the regime. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=939.98s)]
*  It's a good question, maybe a few points in return. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=942.3s)]
*  So I think what was the benefit [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=945.06s)]
*  of President Obama's approach to Iran, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=947.6999999999999s)]
*  he made these unprecedented, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=949.86s)]
*  but I'm sorry, unprecedented, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=952.14s)]
*  but unreciprocated overtures to Iran. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=953.86s)]
*  It kind of exposed in the eyes of the Iranian people [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=956.54s)]
*  that what stood between them and a better future [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=959.2199999999999s)]
*  was not the United States, it was their own leadership. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=961.42s)]
*  I hear that this move is sending the opposite signal, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=964.94s)]
*  that what's standing between Iranians and better future [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=967.86s)]
*  is not necessarily their own regime, but it's Donald Trump. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=970.1s)]
*  And so this is happening, as you said, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=973.58s)]
*  at a time of what I would call a convergence of crises [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=976.02s)]
*  within Iran, there's a currency crisis, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=978.7s)]
*  there's an environmental crisis, there's social crisis, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=981.0600000000001s)]
*  women taking to the streets, removing their headscarves, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=983.58s)]
*  at a time when the regime is hemorrhaging a lot of money [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=987.02s)]
*  in Syria, in Iraq, in Yemen. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=989.98s)]
*  And again, to just accentuate Jake's point, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=993.42s)]
*  instead of focusing on all the bad things [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=996.78s)]
*  Iran is doing in the world, or domestically, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=999.38s)]
*  we've kind of put our finger on the one thing [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1002.8199999999999s)]
*  that Iran has perceived to be doing right, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1004.5s)]
*  which is adhere to the nuclear program. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1006.8199999999999s)]
*  And so I just would accentuate these points that, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1009.02s)]
*  it may be that the Chinese would do some of their [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1013.62s)]
*  their oil imports from Iran, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1017.4599999999999s)]
*  and European companies are forced to make a choice [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1021.62s)]
*  between America and Iran, it's a no-brainer. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1024.6599999999999s)]
*  But, and so you'll have greater economic frustration [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1028.02s)]
*  within Iran, which could simultaneously have two effects. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1033.7s)]
*  One is that we will continue to see more tumult [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1036.8999999999999s)]
*  and uprisings as we are seeing right now [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1040.94s)]
*  in the city of Karzaharoun, outside of Shiraz. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1042.78s)]
*  So these economic protests continue, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1045.46s)]
*  but as a result of that growing insecurity, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1048.02s)]
*  it simultaneously kind of strengthens [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1050.6200000000001s)]
*  the security forces within Iran. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1052.5800000000002s)]
*  And so you could have both at the same time, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1054.38s)]
*  which is more tumult in Iran, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1056.38s)]
*  but a regime security forces revolution [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1059.54s)]
*  in those that are more deeply entrenched than before. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1061.9s)]
*  Do you take the threat of restarting [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1064.8200000000002s)]
*  the nuclear program as real? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1066.38s)]
*  Yeah, I would argue what they'll want to do [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1067.98s)]
*  is reconstitute the nuclear activities [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1070.7s)]
*  in a way that will continue to split the P5 plus one. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1073.3799999999999s)]
*  So instead of saying we're now going for a bomb, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1076.06s)]
*  all the inspectors get out, they'll say, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1078.5s)]
*  continue to remain within the confines [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1082.1s)]
*  of a civilian energy program. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1084.58s)]
*  Maybe that's installing more sophisticated centrifuges. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1086.86s)]
*  Maybe that's announcing that they're exploring [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1090.3s)]
*  the possibility of nuclear submarines, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1092.78s)]
*  one of the few civilian justifications [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1094.98s)]
*  for highly enriched uranium. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1097.1799999999998s)]
*  But to do things which will get United States [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1098.9s)]
*  and obviously Israel and Saudi Arabia [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1103.5800000000002s)]
*  to say Iran is in violation, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1105.0600000000002s)]
*  but Federica Mogherini and the Chinese and the Russians [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1106.7800000000002s)]
*  to say no, they're actually still within the confines. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1109.14s)]
*  So under that scenario, what happens next? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1112.38s)]
*  I mean, you've had one of the biggest cheerleaders [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1116.6200000000001s)]
*  of this outcome we're now at has been Israel. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1119.46s)]
*  You have seen Israel take a more muscular approach [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1122.8600000000001s)]
*  within Syria, but are you actually headed for conflict [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1125.5400000000002s)]
*  or is this just sort of playing out [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1129.74s)]
*  how much the pressure applied, what it results in? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1131.7s)]
*  It seems to me Iran is perhaps the only country [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1135.5s)]
*  in the world that's simultaneously fighting [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1137.74s)]
*  three cold proxy wars with the United States, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1140.1s)]
*  with Israel, with Saudi Arabia. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1142.5s)]
*  And all three of those have the potential for turning hot. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1143.86s)]
*  I'd say the tinderbox that's most explosive at the moment [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1147.7s)]
*  is in Syria with Iran and Israel. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1152.62s)]
*  And if Iran continues to launch attacks on Israel [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1156.42s)]
*  from Syria using more sophisticated technologies [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1161.6200000000001s)]
*  like arms, drones, the Israelis have said [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1165.54s)]
*  they're not only gonna respond in Syria, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1167.14s)]
*  but they're gonna respond in Iran. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1168.5800000000002s)]
*  If Houthis continue to launch missiles, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1171.78s)]
*  if one actually hits the Riyadh airport, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1174.74s)]
*  that's another opportunity. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1176.74s)]
*  But in the nuclear context, I'd say that we're rewinding [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1177.6200000000001s)]
*  to where we were pre-GSTQA, which was Iran is kind of [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1181.3400000000001s)]
*  not racing towards nuclear weapons capability, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1185.74s)]
*  but they're driving their car 15 miles an hour [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1188.42s)]
*  in that direction. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1191.22s)]
*  And whereas the Obama administration exercised restraint [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1192.6200000000001s)]
*  over Israel taking military action against Iran, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1195.94s)]
*  it's not clear to me that the Trump administration [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1199.38s)]
*  will exercise that same restraint. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1202.02s)]
*  And so I've always thought this is kind of [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1204.1s)]
*  the cognitive dissonance of President Trump's policies [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1205.6200000000001s)]
*  toward the Middle East, and that on one hand, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1210.78s)]
*  he wants to get out of the region [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1212.34s)]
*  and announces a withdrawal and he's criticized stupid wars, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1214.5s)]
*  but his Iran policy is certainly hastening that possibility. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1218.4599999999998s)]
*  Just to pick up on that, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1222.1799999999998s)]
*  in the period Kareem was talking about before the JCPOA [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1226.34s)]
*  as Iran was steadily moving its capability forward, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1229.1s)]
*  the Israeli argument was you have to declare your red lines. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1232.3799999999999s)]
*  This was before red line became a kind of four letter word [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1238.5s)]
*  in whatever it is, seven letter two words, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1243.58s)]
*  in Middle East policy. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1247.62s)]
*  They wanted basically to lash the United States [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1249.3s)]
*  to the mast of military action [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1251.98s)]
*  if Iran exceeded certain thresholds. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1253.86s)]
*  I anticipate that they will make the same pitch now [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1255.78s)]
*  to the Trump administration. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1258.38s)]
*  They'll say, okay, if they do a little more R&D, maybe, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1259.98s)]
*  but if they go to 20%, or if they do X, or they do Y, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1263.82s)]
*  or they install this number of centrifuges, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1267.42s)]
*  or they restart certain activities at Fordo, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1269.14s)]
*  the bunker, the underground bunker, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1272.42s)]
*  then we will tell them that is a trigger for military action. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1275.18s)]
*  Because I think what Bibi is convinced of [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1280.3400000000001s)]
*  is that if you set a ceiling on Iran [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1283.9s)]
*  and declare that if you push through that ceiling, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1285.78s)]
*  we will strike you, that they won't. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1288.0600000000002s)]
*  And we may very well find ourselves [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1290.3000000000002s)]
*  in a combined US-Israeli threat to Iran [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1292.66s)]
*  over what will be tolerable [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1296.9s)]
*  and what will not be tolerable [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1298.42s)]
*  in terms of moving the program forward. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1299.8600000000001s)]
*  And because you haven't really heard an alternative [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1303.38s)]
*  from the Trump administration, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1304.7800000000002s)]
*  articulated at this point, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1306.46s)]
*  other than this idea of maybe we go back [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1307.66s)]
*  for the bigger, better deal that Europeans don't want, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1309.9s)]
*  is that the most likely scenario [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1313.1000000000001s)]
*  that you're pulling out, military action? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1314.7s)]
*  Look, just a word on the deal, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1316.94s)]
*  because I've tried to ask, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1319.18s)]
*  leave aside Trump for one second, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1322.5800000000002s)]
*  who I think has basically done his Iran policy for the term, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1324.0200000000002s)]
*  which is rip up Obama's deal. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1328.7800000000002s)]
*  For him now, it's kind of like he's more or less finished. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1331.54s)]
*  If he got some chance to sit down with Rouhani [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1334.62s)]
*  and have a similar Nobel moment, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1336.54s)]
*  I'm sure he'd love to take it. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1337.98s)]
*  But fundamentally, he's now not waking up in the morning [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1339.3799999999999s)]
*  thinking about how we get them to the table. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1341.54s)]
*  So in order to restart serious diplomacy with Iran, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1344.74s)]
*  his team has to be invested in. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1348.94s)]
*  Think about what his team has said is required to do a deal. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1351.18s)]
*  Permanent restrictions on how much Iran can enrich, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1355.82s)]
*  even for peaceful purposes. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1361.02s)]
*  No ballistic missiles, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1362.6599999999999s)]
*  and also a resolution of all of the regional issues too. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1364.1399999999999s)]
*  And American prisoners. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1368.58s)]
*  And American prisoners. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1369.82s)]
*  So just imagine that actual agreement. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1370.6599999999999s)]
*  It defies logic that that is even conceivably possible. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1374.62s)]
*  And I would argue not just from the Iranian side, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1378.5s)]
*  but from the American side. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1381.22s)]
*  But the French also argue that. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1382.4199999999998s)]
*  Well, what the French argue is the US and Europe [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1383.98s)]
*  should sit together and come up with a set of measures [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1387.1399999999999s)]
*  that they impose vis-a-vis ballistic missiles [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1390.74s)]
*  and regional activity [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1393.74s)]
*  that doesn't require some grand bargain with Iran. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1394.74s)]
*  What they were negotiating and very close to arriving [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1397.94s)]
*  at a deal with on the United States [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1400.34s)]
*  was essentially a US EU common policy [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1402.14s)]
*  towards Iran beyond nuclear. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1405.02s)]
*  Macron has thrown out there though, and Syria. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1406.98s)]
*  And Yemen. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1410.1s)]
*  And Syria and Yemen insofar as the US, France, and others [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1411.6200000000001s)]
*  would work together to impose pressure on Iran. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1414.98s)]
*  I think Macron would probably not, if pressed, argue, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1418.74s)]
*  you know what, actually, the US and Iran can sit down [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1422.42s)]
*  and together work out a disposition over Syria. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1425.54s)]
*  Because leave aside whether the Iranians [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1428.66s)]
*  are really up for that, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1430.7s)]
*  the idea that John Bolton and Mike Pompeo [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1431.58s)]
*  are gonna wanna sit with Javad Zarif to work that out [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1433.86s)]
*  is kind of nonsensical. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1437.26s)]
*  And so in a funny way, they've painted themselves [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1438.7s)]
*  into a corner on the possibility of a real deal here. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1442.14s)]
*  Now that doesn't undermine the point [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1445.06s)]
*  that Kareem was making about Trump himself. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1447.82s)]
*  I mean, Trump would do a deal and he'd be happy to say, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1449.98s)]
*  oh yes, Iran and Russia should manage affairs in Syria [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1453.1399999999999s)]
*  as long as they stay 10 miles off to go on or whatever. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1456.98s)]
*  But in the real world of how you actually arrive [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1460.06s)]
*  at a negotiated settlement, it requires [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1463.78s)]
*  US negotiators sitting across from Iranian negotiators [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1468.46s)]
*  and actually doing this. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1471.3s)]
*  And I don't think that's going to happen. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1472.1399999999999s)]
*  So to come back to your question about what's most likely, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1473.46s)]
*  I think we're gonna enter a phase where essentially [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1476.78s)]
*  the punishment is the strategy. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1480.02s)]
*  Squeezing Iran and keeping them in the penalty box [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1482.3s)]
*  for as long as possible and as much as possible. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1484.42s)]
*  The hope of regime change, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1487.02s)]
*  but if not regime change, a weaker regime. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1488.7s)]
*  That's where the US is, indefinitely. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1492.54s)]
*  And I don't think that right now, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1494.3799999999999s)]
*  the US is spoiling for military action. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1496.46s)]
*  But I think that this Israeli logic around the red lines [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1499.34s)]
*  could easily drag them there. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1504.3s)]
*  I think the odds of that have gone up. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1505.94s)]
*  I don't think it's inevitable that we end up striking Iran [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1508.02s)]
*  over their advancement of their nuclear program [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1510.66s)]
*  in the near term because Iran may stay below [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1513.06s)]
*  a certain threshold as they move their capability forward. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1515.22s)]
*  But I think the odds of us [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1518.26s)]
*  either supporting the Israelis in doing it [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1520.8600000000001s)]
*  or joining the Israelis in doing it [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1523.42s)]
*  have gone up considerably just as you play this out. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1525.06s)]
*  Do you regret not having this, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1527.98s)]
*  not presenting this as a treaty? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1531.26s)]
*  Not having congressional buy-in and sign-off? [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1533.62s)]
*  I'll say a couple things about that. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1536.8999999999999s)]
*  The first is, I remember very distinctly [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1538.1399999999999s)]
*  Bob Dole on the floor of the US Senate [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1541.1s)]
*  imploring Republican members to vote for the UN convention [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1544.1399999999999s)]
*  on the rights of persons with disabilities, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1549.1399999999999s)]
*  which imposed no obligations whatsoever on the United States. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1551.34s)]
*  It basically brought the rest of the world [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1554.9399999999998s)]
*  up to the Americans with Disabilities Act standard. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1556.6999999999998s)]
*  And you couldn't get the votes for it. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1559.7399999999998s)]
*  That convinced me that the idea that any treaty, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1562.26s)]
*  let alone a treaty to do with Iran, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1566.06s)]
*  was going to get ratified in the US Senate [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1567.74s)]
*  was so far-fetched as to be entirely implausible. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1570.34s)]
*  So that's sort of point one. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1574.54s)]
*  I don't think there was any world in which [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1575.54s)]
*  even a deal that did everything most of its critics wanted [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1578.46s)]
*  was gonna get 67 votes in the Senate. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1581.22s)]
*  Second thing is that Donald Trump [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1583.9s)]
*  has just as much prerogative to walk away [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1587.26s)]
*  from the duly ratified treaty as he does [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1589.58s)]
*  from this deal. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1592.8999999999999s)]
*  In fact, George Bush did it [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1593.74s)]
*  with the F.F.A. Missile Treaty. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1594.58s)]
*  And I don't think it would have stopped Trump [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1596.3799999999999s)]
*  because his lawyers went to him and said, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1599.3s)]
*  hey, wait a second, this was a treaty. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1601.1399999999999s)]
*  He'd say, I don't like it, it's a terrible deal, I'm out. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1602.6599999999999s)]
*  So I don't find that to be a particularly persuasive [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1605.54s)]
*  argument. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1609.3799999999999s)]
*  I think the question is, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1610.4199999999998s)]
*  when you have a politically contested deal like this, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1613.98s)]
*  that one president does, that has significant [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1617.1399999999999s)]
*  advertised opposition from the other side. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1620.78s)]
*  But this deal had opposition from Democrats. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1624.02s)]
*  From your own side, exactly. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1626.58s)]
*  No, I'm saying, in a world in which you've got, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1627.94s)]
*  this was a deeply divisive proposition. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1632.98s)]
*  And so I find the most reasonable argument [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1641.22s)]
*  that my good friends who are critics of the deal make is, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1643.34s)]
*  well, we told you. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1647.06s)]
*  Leave aside Trump, leave all that aside. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1649.54s)]
*  We told you, elections have consequences, we hated this, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1652.1399999999999s)]
*  and if we came in, we were gonna do something about it. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1655.34s)]
*  Tom Cotton wrote a letter. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1657.02s)]
*  To the Ayatollah, exactly. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1658.86s)]
*  I guess my view is, and I actually think back [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1662.22s)]
*  to an earlier phase in the U.S.-Iran relationship [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1666.6599999999999s)]
*  when Jimmy Carter negotiated the Algiers Accords, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1669.46s)]
*  which themselves were not a treaty or binding, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1671.78s)]
*  and required the U.S. to make a series of concessions [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1674.3799999999999s)]
*  just to get our hostages out, Reagan upheld that. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1677.38s)]
*  That there still should be a space for bipartisan comedy [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1681.5400000000002s)]
*  in terms of how we deal with these things, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1687.0200000000002s)]
*  even in a highly contested space like this. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1689.0600000000002s)]
*  But I recognize we live in a world [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1692.42s)]
*  where that's just no longer that plausible, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1693.9s)]
*  but I think it weakens the American hand globally [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1695.46s)]
*  for any president that we decide, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1698.7s)]
*  well, my predecessor did it, but screw it, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1701.46s)]
*  I don't need to comply with it, I think it's a problem. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1703.3000000000002s)]
*  Can I just make a couple more points on that? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1706.06s)]
*  Because it's, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1707.5s)]
*  first of all, I have not heard anybody who's complaining [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1712.5s)]
*  about the JCPOA not being a treaty proposing [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1714.98s)]
*  an NNAR-like mechanism for a North Korea deal. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1718.1s)]
*  I've also not really heard a strong push to say, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1721.3s)]
*  well, the president shouldn't have the unilateral ability [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1724.8999999999999s)]
*  to ratchet down tension, and neither should they have [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1727.3799999999999s)]
*  the unilateral ability to ratchet up tension. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1729.4199999999998s)]
*  So this seems to me to be an entirely [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1731.3s)]
*  politically convenient argument, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1733.3799999999999s)]
*  not one really- [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1734.86s)]
*  Lindsey Graham has said he'd like to see it be a treaty. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1735.6999999999998s)]
*  I asked him about it Sunday. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1738.34s)]
*  Okay, but again, I haven't seen a move- [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1739.62s)]
*  The North Korea thing. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1741.2199999999998s)]
*  A North Korea, yeah. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1742.1399999999999s)]
*  I haven't seen a move in the Senate [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1742.9799999999998s)]
*  to even propose an NNAR-like mechanism [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1743.9799999999998s)]
*  to involve the Congress in a designed way. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1746.2199999999998s)]
*  And in fact, according to colleagues [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1750.1s)]
*  I've spoken to this week, there haven't even yet been [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1752.1799999999998s)]
*  staff or member briefings from the administration [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1754.6999999999998s)]
*  about the decision to pull out of the JCPOA. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1756.6999999999998s)]
*  So the idea that somehow this is about [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1758.9799999999998s)]
*  a congressional prerogative and needing [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1762.62s)]
*  to have broad-based support for important [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1765.3s)]
*  foreign policy decisions, that is an argument [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1766.6599999999999s)]
*  imposed after President Trump's decision. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1769.1s)]
*  And I would go farther and say that sure, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1772.26s)]
*  people can say, look, there's broad opposition, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1773.82s)]
*  all the Republican candidates oppose this. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1776.1399999999999s)]
*  Again, look across the Republican members [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1778.1s)]
*  of the United States Senate. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1780.62s)]
*  You did not see people clamoring for the destruction [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1781.46s)]
*  of the JCPOA under President Trump. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1785.1399999999999s)]
*  And in fact, on three occasions since last year, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1786.78s)]
*  President Trump opened up a window for the Senate [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1790.1799999999998s)]
*  to be able to take a 50-vote majority [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1792.38s)]
*  to pull out of the JCPOA. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1795.7800000000002s)]
*  It was never even put to the floor. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1797.9s)]
*  It was never even discussed. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1799.9s)]
*  So I do think that there is something [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1801.38s)]
*  uniquely Trumpian in this and not simply [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1803.6200000000001s)]
*  the broader breakdown of our politics, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1806.6200000000001s)]
*  which I agree with as well, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1808.5s)]
*  but it's not the whole story here. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1810.74s)]
*  And I want to say one other thing about Jake's [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1812.5s)]
*  previous answer, which I fully agree with. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1814.98s)]
*  He laid out this sort of comically expanded agenda, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1817.1000000000001s)]
*  concessions that we would need from Iran. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1822.1s)]
*  It's even worse really than Jake has suggested [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1823.58s)]
*  because Iran's ballistic missile program [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1825.6999999999998s)]
*  and their regional proxies are core [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1830.2199999999998s)]
*  to their national security thinking. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1832.06s)]
*  And so whereas you can imagine on the nuclear file, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1834.8999999999999s)]
*  and we were able to succeed on the nuclear file, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1837.2199999999998s)]
*  in a deal that has them making a security concession [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1839.3s)]
*  and us making an economic concession, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1842.58s)]
*  that's not gonna work on their ballistic missiles [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1844.86s)]
*  where they really do, rightly or wrongly, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1846.6599999999999s)]
*  perceive the existence of a threat. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1848.98s)]
*  So it's not just that we would need to be at the table [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1851.1s)]
*  making this deal. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1853.1799999999998s)]
*  It's that we would have to have a group of regional countries [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1854.62s)]
*  who don't even really talk to each other [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1857.3s)]
*  now making security concessions to Iran [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1858.9599999999998s)]
*  in order to get this universal deal. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1861.34s)]
*  And I'd add one more point on this because [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1863.62s)]
*  this argument which said one of the major flaws [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1868.1399999999999s)]
*  of the nuclear deal is it didn't deal [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1870.82s)]
*  with all the regional behavior emerged [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1872.1799999999998s)]
*  as one of the chief critiques in recent months. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1874.4599999999998s)]
*  And look, they're unleashed upon the region [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1878.78s)]
*  and the like. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1880.9s)]
*  Well, it was discussed at the time of the deal too. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1881.74s)]
*  It was, but I would argue that at the time, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1883.5400000000002s)]
*  there was much more willingness to see the nuclear issue [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1886.98s)]
*  for what it was then, which was the priority. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1890.38s)]
*  The thing that Bibi Netanyahu went to the UN [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1892.5800000000002s)]
*  and held up the cartoon bomb, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1895.8200000000002s)]
*  it's now that the nuclear issue has been resolved, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1898.0400000000002s)]
*  there's a new big thing and it's the regional stuff. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1901.5600000000002s)]
*  So I think it took on a much different level of importance. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1903.76s)]
*  If you talk to critics of the deal [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1907.8200000000002s)]
*  and hawks on Iran, they will now say two things. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1910.12s)]
*  One, no deal that doesn't involve Iran [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1915.6399999999999s)]
*  making major concessions on the regional front [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1921.1999999999998s)]
*  is a good deal. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1924.58s)]
*  And two, this regime is not capable [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1925.9599999999998s)]
*  of making major concessions on the regional front [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1929.9199999999998s)]
*  because this regime has it just deeply embedded [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1932.7199999999998s)]
*  in their psyche to have to be doing all of these things. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1935.7399999999998s)]
*  It doesn't take a logical genius to see [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1939.32s)]
*  that that means no deal with this regime, period. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1941.9199999999998s)]
*  And that's Bolton's view. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1946.1599999999999s)]
*  And so they don't say it that way. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1949.36s)]
*  They say, oh, we could do a deal [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1952.1399999999999s)]
*  if it's just the right deal. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1953.3999999999999s)]
*  But fundamentally, I think this is the, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1955.74s)]
*  frankly, the dishonesty of that strand of critique [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1960.84s)]
*  of the Iran nuclear deal. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1965.06s)]
*  And that's why I think we're just headed for a period [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1966.08s)]
*  of more or less pressure for pressure's sake, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1968.64s)]
*  and we'll see what happens. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1970.8000000000002s)]
*  I wanna go to questions from the audience, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1972.64s)]
*  but Kareem, did you wanna button that up? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1974.5800000000002s)]
*  I mean, Zarif even said, the foreign minister even says, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1976.68s)]
*  U.S. never gave up on regime change. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1980.44s)]
*  John Bolton's entry into this administration [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1983.0400000000002s)]
*  isn't what makes that their assumption at this point. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1985.68s)]
*  They always thought that's what the real motivation was. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1990.3200000000002s)]
*  Is that the takeaway, you think, for the regime? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1992.8600000000001s)]
*  Well, I think that that's disingenuous from Zeddi, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1996.12s)]
*  because President Obama, for eight years, I would argue, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=1998.8s)]
*  really did try to reassure the Iranians [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2001.52s)]
*  that he wasn't after regime change. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2003.36s)]
*  He wrote several letters to the Supreme Leader [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2005.6799999999998s)]
*  trying to reassure him. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2008.1599999999999s)]
*  In 2009, when Iran was, several million people [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2009.8s)]
*  had taken to the streets. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2013.1599999999999s)]
*  If we wanted to try to push for regime change there, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2014.04s)]
*  it would have been a good opportunity. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2017.28s)]
*  And Secretary Clinton said that was the biggest regret [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2018.48s)]
*  as our 10-year secretary of state not doing more than. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2021.8799999999999s)]
*  So the Iranian government is always going to say [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2024.9399999999998s)]
*  the U.S. has never changed its regime change plan. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2027.74s)]
*  But the reality is, I think, that the Iranian government [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2030.5s)]
*  had a year and a half, two years after the JCPOA was signed [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2033.78s)]
*  if they wanted to try to improve relations [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2037.86s)]
*  with the United States. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2040.58s)]
*  Secretary Kerry's speech writer is here. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2042.4199999999998s)]
*  I'm guessing if Secretary Kerry had been given an invite [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2044.34s)]
*  to visit Tehran, he would have taken it. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2046.76s)]
*  I'm not sure if President Obama would have taken that. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2048.9s)]
*  But it was clear this was the administration [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2051.0s)]
*  since the 1979 revolution that was more favorably [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2054.52s)]
*  disposed than any administration to some type [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2058.48s)]
*  of rapprochement with Iran. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2060.68s)]
*  But after the deal was signed, what did Iran do? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2062.44s)]
*  It took my friend, Seyel Mack Namazee, put him in jail. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2064.52s)]
*  It put his father in jail. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2067.36s)]
*  It put other U.S. citizens in jail. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2068.68s)]
*  It put dual national European-Iranians in prison. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2070.34s)]
*  I would argue it resumed and probably increased [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2073.48s)]
*  its longstanding regional policies, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2077.92s)]
*  whether that's support for Assad, Hezbollah, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2079.86s)]
*  Shia militias. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2082.7400000000002s)]
*  And so I do think there was an opportunity [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2083.96s)]
*  if the Iranian government wanted, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2087.6600000000003s)]
*  if the Supreme Leader wanted it, to build on the JCPOA. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2089.5s)]
*  And it would have been much more difficult [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2093.82s)]
*  for the Trump administration to tear it up as they have. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2096.26s)]
*  But the challenge is that this is a government [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2098.76s)]
*  divided in Tehran. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2102.1400000000003s)]
*  You have one part of the government [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2103.3s)]
*  that doesn't have much power, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2106.42s)]
*  that wants to see a better relationship [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2108.0600000000004s)]
*  with the United States and those who are a minority, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2110.42s)]
*  but who have power, who fear that as an existential threat. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2112.7400000000002s)]
*  Can we bring a microphone up to the front row here? [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2118.26s)]
*  Thank you, and then we'll come to you. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2121.9s)]
*  If you just say your name, your affiliation, please. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2123.5s)]
*  Hi, Nelson Cunningham with the Clardy Associates. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2125.6600000000003s)]
*  Jake saw me nodding vigorously as he was talking [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2128.5600000000004s)]
*  about the prospect of a sanctions off [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2131.46s)]
*  between the U.S. and the EU and China, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2134.1000000000004s)]
*  where we try to up the level of sanctions, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2136.9s)]
*  they try to up the level of counter sanctions. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2138.7400000000002s)]
*  But I think it's even worse than what Jake mentioned, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2141.2200000000003s)]
*  because sanctions are not government on government actions. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2143.46s)]
*  Sanctions involve essentially taking all of your companies [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2147.42s)]
*  and making them your soldiers, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2150.98s)]
*  making them your weapons against the enemy. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2152.6600000000003s)]
*  You say to Citibank, do not deal with them. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2157.98s)]
*  You say to the Europeans, do not deal with the Iranians. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2161.06s)]
*  What's gonna happen is that, in effect, companies, banks, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2164.82s)]
*  oil companies, manufacturers, will become hostages [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2169.1800000000003s)]
*  waiting to be shot by either side, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2173.34s)]
*  because if Citibank does, in fact, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2176.0600000000004s)]
*  stop dealing with Deutsche Bank, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2178.2200000000003s)]
*  the Europeans will punish Citibank. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2179.82s)]
*  So we could face not just a government on government effort, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2182.02s)]
*  but one that actually damages companies [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2188.26s)]
*  and materially damages transatlantic trade [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2190.7200000000003s)]
*  at the same time that you have to steal an aluminum tariff. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2193.86s)]
*  So there are broad economic consequences, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2196.26s)]
*  I would argue, that flow from this sanctions off, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2199.58s)]
*  and not just the government to government tensions [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2201.82s)]
*  that we outlined, it's worse. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2204.6200000000003s)]
*  I think this is actually a really important point, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2207.3s)]
*  that at the end of the day, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2209.7000000000003s)]
*  it's ultimately gonna be a series of commercial decisions [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2211.34s)]
*  about what risk many of these European companies [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2213.86s)]
*  wanna take on, financial institutions, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2216.6600000000003s)]
*  oil purchasers and the like. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2220.1400000000003s)]
*  And I think part of the reason why there's some skepticism [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2222.26s)]
*  that the Europeans will ultimately be able to stand up [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2225.98s)]
*  to the United States on this is that the compliance [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2227.94s)]
*  departments of these companies are just gonna say, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2229.98s)]
*  don't, you know, you don't wanna deal with OFAC right now. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2232.38s)]
*  That's probably right, but that's what makes this. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2236.94s)]
*  That's the Israeli argument. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2240.98s)]
*  That's the Israeli argument and the Trump [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2242.5s)]
*  administration argument, which is if you have to choose [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2243.86s)]
*  between Iran and the US, you're gonna choose the US. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2245.6600000000003s)]
*  I think there are two basic challenges with that. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2247.7000000000003s)]
*  One, that's far less true with respect to China [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2249.88s)]
*  than it is with respect to the European Union. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2252.7200000000003s)]
*  And two, to the extent that the European Union [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2254.86s)]
*  begins designing special purpose vehicles [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2257.48s)]
*  of one form or another to insulate certain transactions [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2259.76s)]
*  and certain companies from sanctions, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2263.92s)]
*  as Nelson was saying, those companies then are gonna be [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2266.8s)]
*  caught betwixt and between. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2269.1600000000003s)]
*  Do they, they're gonna, in a way, they're gonna look [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2271.96s)]
*  at mommy and daddy fighting and think, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2275.96s)]
*  please work it out because we feel we're gonna be screwed [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2278.92s)]
*  one way or the other. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2281.8s)]
*  But isn't this what the Iranians were already complaining [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2282.64s)]
*  was happening? [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2284.4s)]
*  Because they're saying that the US wasn't delivering [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2285.6800000000003s)]
*  the financial incentives that they had been promised. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2288.12s)]
*  Right, I mean, that's just the point, actually, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2290.52s)]
*  of why this measure is unlikely to produce [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2292.46s)]
*  great leverage over Iran right now. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2295.92s)]
*  Because it's true that Total and Siemens are not gonna choose [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2297.88s)]
*  politically motivated Iran business over their profit [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2303.16s)]
*  centers in the United States. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2306.04s)]
*  That can't be the element, that can't be the rump JCPOA. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2308.62s)]
*  The rump JCPOA has to be things that are more directly [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2312.14s)]
*  under government's control. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2314.46s)]
*  But the point is that Siemens, sorry, Total hadn't put [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2316.46s)]
*  more than $40 million in Iran anyway. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2319.74s)]
*  Siemens had done nothing but sell to Iran. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2322.62s)]
*  So these are political blows to Iranian supporters [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2325.08s)]
*  of the JCPOA. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2328.8599999999997s)]
*  They're not really economic leverage over Iran. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2329.7s)]
*  So the kinds of things that European governments [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2332.2999999999997s)]
*  could realistically do are not forced Total to do business. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2334.7s)]
*  But there are ways, for example, that they could make sure [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2339.1s)]
*  that the oil keeps flowing. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2341.62s)]
*  Again, they would do that solely out of political concerns [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2343.2599999999998s)]
*  and not out of economic ones. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2346.3799999999997s)]
*  Just one last thing, which is to say, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2347.98s)]
*  Nelson's also pointed out the dirty little secret [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2350.8199999999997s)]
*  of our secondary sanctions policy, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2353.18s)]
*  which is that we can't actually use it. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2354.7s)]
*  We cannot designate Deutsche Bank for secondary sanctions. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2357.3399999999997s)]
*  It would be the end of the global economy. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2360.7999999999997s)]
*  It would be like saying, remember Lehman? [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2362.26s)]
*  Let's do that again. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2365.5800000000004s)]
*  But entirely at our own discretion. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2367.86s)]
*  So secondary sanctions work because all of the regulated [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2370.0600000000004s)]
*  community decides to follow along. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2375.94s)]
*  If we create compelling reasons for our allied governments [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2379.1800000000003s)]
*  to find ways to work around that threat, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2383.2200000000003s)]
*  it might not be today and it might not be next year. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2387.32s)]
*  There will come a point where we want to use this tool [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2391.02s)]
*  and it's just not going to be nearly as strong. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2393.6600000000003s)]
*  I promise to you here. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2397.2200000000003s)]
*  We're bringing a microphone. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2401.06s)]
*  I'm wondering, given the Turkish and Brazilian involvement [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2404.62s)]
*  with Iran and their nuclear program [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2408.5s)]
*  in the Tehran declaration in 2010, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2410.1s)]
*  what if any kind of leadership could we expect [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2412.58s)]
*  from those countries moving forward [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2414.7400000000002s)]
*  after the fallout of the JCPOA [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2416.82s)]
*  or Trump's decision to pull out of the JCPOA [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2419.98s)]
*  or any other countries who are not P5 members? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2422.9s)]
*  Well, that was a somewhat unique case [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2426.94s)]
*  where you had two ambitious leaders [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2429.6600000000003s)]
*  looking to leave a mark on the global stage [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2434.3s)]
*  on a major issue of international importance. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2436.82s)]
*  You had Erdogan, you had Lula in Brazil, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2439.02s)]
*  and what they wanted to do was rescue a deal [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2440.78s)]
*  that had been initially struck between the US and Iran [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2446.34s)]
*  on the Tehran research reactor, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2449.3s)]
*  that they were going to figure out a way to do it, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2450.6200000000003s)]
*  that the material would be shipped out of Iran, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2452.1400000000003s)]
*  the fuel rods would be fabricated and then sent back in, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2457.94s)]
*  and that this would be a way [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2460.94s)]
*  to address proliferation concerns. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2461.98s)]
*  A, I don't think Brazil now is in a place [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2464.38s)]
*  where it's going to be doing much of anything [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2467.1000000000004s)]
*  on the Iran deal. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2468.5s)]
*  It's sort of domestically focused [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2469.34s)]
*  and doesn't have a leadership [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2470.9s)]
*  that has the same ambitions as Lula. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2472.0600000000004s)]
*  B, Erdogan now has more than enough to say grace over [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2475.14s)]
*  in terms of a lot of other considerations, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2478.18s)]
*  both in the bilateral relationship with Iran [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2480.42s)]
*  and with the United States [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2482.86s)]
*  and with larger regional policy. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2483.94s)]
*  But I do think we have to ask ourselves [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2486.1s)]
*  about countries like Turkey, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2488.9s)]
*  what role did they end up playing [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2490.66s)]
*  in facilitating Iran's effort [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2492.14s)]
*  to reduce the impact of American sanctions? [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2493.86s)]
*  Even when Turkey, we had the great coalition, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2496.66s)]
*  Turkey was looking the other way. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2502.38s)]
*  We had some pretty massive sanctions busting activities, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2504.06s)]
*  some of which are now the subject [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2507.9s)]
*  of American criminal prosecution. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2509.18s)]
*  And I think that there will be a number of countries [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2511.22s)]
*  who look at the Trump administration [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2513.2999999999997s)]
*  and look at the JCPOA and say, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2515.2999999999997s)]
*  back to a kind of older anti-imperial view, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2518.2999999999997s)]
*  this is BS. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2521.58s)]
*  And so to the extent we can play a role [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2523.02s)]
*  in helping the Iranians not just have to succumb [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2526.22s)]
*  to American domineering, we'll help in some way. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2529.74s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if that element is alive in Turkey [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2533.34s)]
*  and in some other countries [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2537.1800000000003s)]
*  that are kind of in that band of middle powers. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2538.78s)]
*  I'll take one from the back there [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2544.06s)]
*  and then we'll come to you up front. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2546.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2550.58s)]
*  I think you all agreed that the threat of Iran [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2552.86s)]
*  restarting the nuclear program is real, right? [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2558.34s)]
*  But considering all challenges [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2562.7s)]
*  that Islamic Republic of Iran is facing, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2565.2999999999997s)]
*  especially the economical issues and deep corruption, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2569.8199999999997s)]
*  a lot of factories are shut down [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2574.2599999999998s)]
*  and a lot of workers are protesting [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2576.58s)]
*  in a lot of cities in Iran. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2580.14s)]
*  Why do we consider Tehran starting negotiation with Trump [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2582.06s)]
*  as North Korea and Venezuela recently started? [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2586.2999999999997s)]
*  Sorry, what's your name and where are you from? [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2590.46s)]
*  Hossein. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2592.06s)]
*  Are you with an organization? [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2593.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm from Freedom House. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2595.34s)]
*  I didn't get the exact question. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2598.26s)]
*  So why doesn't Trump talk to Tehran like he? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2600.46s)]
*  No, why don't we consider that Tehran starts negotiation [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2604.38s)]
*  with Trump as North Korea started [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2608.26s)]
*  and Venezuela started to, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2611.1s)]
*  that they are ready to negotiate with Trump? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2612.9s)]
*  So I think Trump would be amenable to that. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2615.98s)]
*  As Jake said, I think that Trump would be happy to, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2619.18s)]
*  and he's in fact tried to meet with President Rouhani. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2622.7s)]
*  I think the distinction between Iran [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2625.62s)]
*  and just to stay with North Korea and Kim Jong-un [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2628.26s)]
*  is Ali Khamenei versus Kim Jong-un. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2631.94s)]
*  I told Khamenei he's 78 years old. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2635.1s)]
*  I don't think he is looking at a 20-year plan, right? [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2638.5s)]
*  He wants to die supreme leader. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2641.42s)]
*  And for three decades, enmity towards the United States, [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2643.34s)]
*  mistrust of the United States has been one of the three [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2646.94s)]
*  pillars, I'd say, of the Islamic Republic, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2650.42s)]
*  inextricable to the identity of the Islamic Republic [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2652.34s)]
*  from his point of view. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2655.1s)]
*  Donald Trump has vindicated his worldview [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2656.58s)]
*  that America cannot be trusted. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2658.7400000000002s)]
*  I think he feels that he's been proven right. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2661.66s)]
*  And so this is in fact a question mark for me. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2665.66s)]
*  Let's fast forward six months and let's say [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2668.46s)]
*  if the Israeli projections are correct [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2670.54s)]
*  that Iran's economic conditions continue to worsen. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2674.42s)]
*  You continue to see not only economic protests, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2678.82s)]
*  social protests, environmental protests, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2681.46s)]
*  downward spiraling currency, and people go to Khamenei [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2683.7400000000002s)]
*  and say, listen, you have to exhibit [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2687.3s)]
*  the same heroic flexibility. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2689.54s)]
*  That was the term he used before, heroic flexibility [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2691.1800000000003s)]
*  that you did in signing the JCPOA. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2693.54s)]
*  I'm not sure whether he will be able to overcome his pride [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2696.3s)]
*  and bitterness and cynicism of the Trump administration. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2700.1800000000003s)]
*  Who would be negotiating that deal [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2705.06s)]
*  or who would be taking part in the negotiations [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2707.38s)]
*  from our end as well as Jake said? [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2709.74s)]
*  Is it Mike Pompeo, John Bolton? [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2711.22s)]
*  I always like to quote John Kenneth Galbraith. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2719.1s)]
*  He said that economic forecasting exists [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2721.54s)]
*  to make astrology look respectable. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2725.14s)]
*  And I think Middle East forecasting [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2728.2599999999998s)]
*  makes astrology even more respectable. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2730.22s)]
*  So I don't think it's a 0% chance [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2732.14s)]
*  that he is forced to come back to the table and renegotiate. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2734.7s)]
*  But I think it's really going to take [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2739.5s)]
*  enormous economic pain and real existential angst [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2743.7799999999997s)]
*  for him to come back and renegotiate [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2748.8599999999997s)]
*  when he feels that they were already wrong. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2751.18s)]
*  I think you need two things to happen at once. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2754.22s)]
*  One, you need the Iranians to overcome [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2756.62s)]
*  the various psychological and political obstacles [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2759.94s)]
*  that Kareem described, which I also don't rule out. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2762.46s)]
*  I think it's unlikely, but I don't rule it out. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2765.42s)]
*  Then you also need the American side [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2767.38s)]
*  to react in a way to that overture that doesn't say, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2770.38s)]
*  as I think the current logic would have them say, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2774.6600000000003s)]
*  see, now we got them on the ropes. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2776.62s)]
*  That's capitulation. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2778.5s)]
*  Actually, this is proof our strategy is working. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2779.7400000000002s)]
*  We just have to push a little harder. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2782.58s)]
*  And that is what the Israelis will argue, I promise you, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2784.46s)]
*  because when Rahani and Zarif came and said, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2787.1s)]
*  let's do a deal, the Israeli reaction was not, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2790.74s)]
*  okay, now we've set things up to get what we need. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2793.38s)]
*  It was, oh, this is a signal that just squeezing a bit more [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2795.7s)]
*  will put it over the top. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2801.06s)]
*  So you need both of those things to happen [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2802.5s)]
*  in order to produce the framework for a negotiation [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2806.06s)]
*  that could succeed in dealing with this diplomatically. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2809.74s)]
*  I do not rule out the possibility. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2813.5s)]
*  I find it unlikely. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2815.34s)]
*  But Karim, Rahani, as you said, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2818.46s)]
*  was offered this chance to meet. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2820.9s)]
*  Macron was the intermediary at UNGA, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2822.78s)]
*  at the UN General Assembly, and the Iranians said no [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2825.38s)]
*  to Trump's request for a meeting. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2828.54s)]
*  Zarif has also said and admitted that US officials [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2830.7000000000003s)]
*  have approached them about talking simply [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2834.6600000000003s)]
*  about the Americans and starting a consular dialogue, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2836.6200000000003s)]
*  and the Iranians have said no to that. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2839.3s)]
*  So there have been some overtures made by the US. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2841.3s)]
*  Is it simply that at this point, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2846.1800000000003s)]
*  Rahani can't ever be that person [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2850.94s)]
*  if the Supreme Leader remains who he is? [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2853.02s)]
*  You're right, those overtures have been made, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2856.78s)]
*  and again, I think if we're up to Rahani, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2859.38s)]
*  I think he recognizes that the death to America culture [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2863.9s)]
*  of 1979 doesn't make sense in 2018. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2868.38s)]
*  I've always thought the distinction between Rahani [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2871.7000000000003s)]
*  and Khamenei is like distinguishing [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2874.42s)]
*  between Deng Xiaoping and Brezhnev. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2877.34s)]
*  Rahani essentially wants to put economic interests [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2879.98s)]
*  before revolutionary ideology, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2883.46s)]
*  do what China did in the 1970s, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2886.34s)]
*  and Khamenei is Brezhnev. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2888.42s)]
*  He's committed to the status quo. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2889.98s)]
*  Committed to, he would argue that once you start [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2892.9s)]
*  to compromise on your pillars, on your principles, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2895.98s)]
*  that's why they call themselves principlists, [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2900.7s)]
*  once you start to compromise on your principles, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2902.26s)]
*  it's like what Gorbachev did to the Soviet Union, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2904.66s)]
*  hasten the collapse. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2907.58s)]
*  So I don't think he is going to give license to Zarif [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2909.1s)]
*  or Rahani to embark on some type of negotiations, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2915.06s)]
*  again, unless and until, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2918.9s)]
*  I think Jake's two conditions are right. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2920.9s)]
*  There's significant existential pressure [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2922.82s)]
*  on the regime and also the belief that the US strategy [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2926.58s)]
*  isn't simply, isn't regime change. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2929.2999999999997s)]
*  I think they did feel that in the case [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2932.1s)]
*  of the Obama administration, that you guys were, [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2935.06s)]
*  President Obama had sent multiple letters, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2937.9799999999996s)]
*  Jake and Bill going to Oman. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2940.2999999999997s)]
*  I think they felt sufficiently reassured, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2942.3399999999997s)]
*  despite what Zarif said, that the Obama administration's [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2944.5s)]
*  strategy was not regime change. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2947.5s)]
*  I promised you up front and then we'll go to the back. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2951.8199999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2955.74s)]
*  My name is Sina Azaria, I'm a PhD student in political [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2960.58s)]
*  science, you all sort of touched on it. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2963.8999999999996s)]
*  So where are we headed with regards to US Iranian relations? [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2966.4199999999996s)]
*  You said more pressure for the sake of pressure. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2970.7799999999997s)]
*  Anything else from the panelists? [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2974.4599999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2977.02s)]
*  One thing I'd say is that I don't believe Iran [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2979.9399999999996s)]
*  is going to be able to convince the world [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2983.54s)]
*  that they are indispensable to the global economy. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2986.14s)]
*  0.6% of total EU traders with Iran, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2991.14s)]
*  I think 20% of total EU traders with the United States. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2994.62s)]
*  And the Chinese can buy a little bit more oil [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=2998.46s)]
*  from Saudi Arabia, from the UAE, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3002.18s)]
*  reduce the purchases from Iran. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3003.46s)]
*  So Iran hasn't done a good job of showing [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3004.82s)]
*  that they are indispensable to the global economy. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3006.46s)]
*  So I think one of the arguments they will try [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3009.18s)]
*  to project explicitly or implicitly, [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3011.7s)]
*  and in fact Adolf Chee said this in an interview once, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3014.14s)]
*  is to essentially try to make it clear to the Europeans [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3016.74s)]
*  that we are indispensable to your security. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3019.62s)]
*  And if you pull out of the JCPOA, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3022.4199999999996s)]
*  we can act in a way which will create far more refugees [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3025.02s)]
*  fleeing from the Middle East into Europe. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3028.58s)]
*  And so I've thought that this can, [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3032.2999999999997s)]
*  by continuing to escalate against Israel and Syria, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3035.8999999999996s)]
*  it ticks that box, but it also ticks another box, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3040.7s)]
*  which is that for the last several years, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3043.98s)]
*  the conversation in the Middle East has been [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3046.2999999999997s)]
*  Iran's clients killing Sunni Arabs. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3048.8599999999997s)]
*  And that's been terrible for Iran's brand name [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3051.22s)]
*  if they want to be the champion, [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3053.8999999999996s)]
*  not only of the Shia world, but the entire Islamic world. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3055.66s)]
*  And so the best way to change that conversation [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3058.8599999999997s)]
*  is Israelis killing Palestinians. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3060.8199999999997s)]
*  And so I think provoking something against Israel, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3062.9399999999996s)]
*  whether it's from Syria, whether it's in Gaza, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3065.98s)]
*  whether it's from Lebanon with Hezbollah rockets, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3068.54s)]
*  I think suits Iran's interests well. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3071.22s)]
*  And so then the question is, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3073.82s)]
*  if there is an Iranian-Israeli conflagration in the region, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3075.22s)]
*  how does the US choose to respond to that [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3080.22s)]
*  when Pompeo has said that we'll come to the rescue of Israel [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3083.7799999999997s)]
*  and Trump has said we wanna pull out of the region? [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3086.42s)]
*  And I think this is the final question [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3090.02s)]
*  I had promised in back, I don't see, there you go. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3091.82s)]
*  You have a microphone coming? [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3096.02s)]
*  George Perkovich from Carnegie. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3099.42s)]
*  It's actually picking up on Kareem's answer, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3101.02s)]
*  but trying to elaborate a little bit more. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3103.38s)]
*  And that is to say, given Iran's interests, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3105.82s)]
*  its history, ideology, its power, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3109.98s)]
*  if the US or someone has broken an agreement with it [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3114.54s)]
*  with the idea that to get them to renegotiate [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3118.54s)]
*  worst terms from the standpoint of Iran, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3121.38s)]
*  doesn't Iran have to make you pay? [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3125.42s)]
*  Even if ultimately they might come back [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3127.94s)]
*  to some kind of negotiation. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3130.78s)]
*  At first you have to pay for the reasons that Jake outlined. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3131.9s)]
*  If you don't, it just invites more such punishment [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3134.5s)]
*  and reward. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3138.94s)]
*  Kareem alluded to some of the ways [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3140.02s)]
*  in which they could make us or others pay. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3141.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm just wondering if Jared or Jake have additional ideas [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3144.54s)]
*  of things Iran could do to kind of change the leverage [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3149.64s)]
*  and make it less unfavorable than it now appears. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3153.9s)]
*  Well, I would say that in addition to the regional [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3158.86s)]
*  activities that Kareem referenced, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3162.3s)]
*  I think they learned, the lesson that they learned [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3164.94s)]
*  from the JCPOA context was that there's a certain kind [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3167.46s)]
*  of dual clock logic. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3172.06s)]
*  There's the sanctions clock [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3173.94s)]
*  versus the nuclear capability clock. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3175.9s)]
*  And that as the sanctions get tighter, [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3178.94s)]
*  they need to be adding capability [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3181.18s)]
*  so that they can negotiate both down. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3183.4199999999996s)]
*  And so I have to think that they will be trying [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3186.7s)]
*  to figure out what can we do on the nuclear front [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3188.98s)]
*  that does what Kareem said earlier, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3193.1s)]
*  adds to our leverage vis-a-vis the United States [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3196.1s)]
*  because it puts them in a more difficult position [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3198.3999999999996s)]
*  without destroying the international sympathy [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3200.7s)]
*  that we built up with all of our friends and partners. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3204.58s)]
*  I think that nuclear subs would probably go across that line, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3207.1s)]
*  the Europeans and the Chinese would say, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3210.2599999999998s)]
*  hold on a second here, 60% for some nonsense claim. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3211.9399999999996s)]
*  Announce plans for it, but you don't actually do it. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3217.3799999999997s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3219.5s)]
*  But I think even that, I think, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3220.66s)]
*  they may misjudge this too, by the way. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3222.8199999999997s)]
*  But my view is that they will be focused on R&D [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3225.06s)]
*  so that they continue the narrative [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3229.58s)]
*  of national scientific achievement, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3231.62s)]
*  but also can go around to people and say, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3233.58s)]
*  we can have centrifuges 20 times more powerful, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3235.8599999999997s)]
*  which in turn raises the possibility of the covert program [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3239.46s)]
*  to a more significant extent. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3242.26s)]
*  I think that will be the main area where they focus [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3243.86s)]
*  as opposed to say going to 20% or adding a lot. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3246.34s)]
*  And then I think Fordow will be the other place [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3248.6600000000003s)]
*  where they'll say, look, at this point, [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3251.82s)]
*  we have these explicit threats of military action [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3254.54s)]
*  coming from all sides, so it only makes sense for us [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3257.42s)]
*  to be exercising our nuclear rights, [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3260.7400000000002s)]
*  both under the NPT and the JCPOA, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3264.1s)]
*  in a place that's protected, [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3266.34s)]
*  which will also raise the hackles [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3267.98s)]
*  of the Americans and the Israelis, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3269.54s)]
*  but not so much the rest of the world. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3270.78s)]
*  So I think that's gonna be a big area of focus for them [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3273.06s)]
*  as we go forward here, if they can't get some form [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3275.34s)]
*  of satisfaction from the Europeans, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3278.38s)]
*  at least for a while, on the Rump JCPOA, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3280.34s)]
*  as Jarrett put it, but I don't know if you. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3283.54s)]
*  So, I mean, if we play this out a few more weeks [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3285.98s)]
*  or a few more months and Rump JCPOA negotiations [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3289.1s)]
*  have collapsed, I think I agree with Jake [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3291.82s)]
*  in terms of where the focus of violations of the JCPOA [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3294.42s)]
*  is likely to be, I certainly think Fordow [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3299.34s)]
*  would make a lot of sense. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3301.42s)]
*  I do think that they would probably need to do [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3302.9s)]
*  some more headline grabbing things, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3305.06s)]
*  like, I don't know, restart the TRR fuel production lines, [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3307.7400000000002s)]
*  that would be getting up to 20% again, [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3312.5s)]
*  and that's my guess of their politics. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3314.7400000000002s)]
*  There are just two other things I feel like [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3319.58s)]
*  we haven't mentioned that are worth bearing in mind. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3321.02s)]
*  One is that Iran has got politics [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3323.26s)]
*  and there are powerful factions in Iran [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3326.0600000000004s)]
*  that profit from isolation. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3328.46s)]
*  And so, there's every reason for, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3330.94s)]
*  some of the economic actors who actually have lost control [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3333.6600000000003s)]
*  of industrial enterprises over the last year, 18 months, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3336.5400000000004s)]
*  to take a look at this as an opportunity [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3339.94s)]
*  and not to be rushing back to solve the problem. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3341.5s)]
*  The second thing I would just leave with is, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3344.86s)]
*  we spent a lot of time sort of disparaging the idea [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3346.6600000000003s)]
*  that this could lead to a quote unquote better deal. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3349.3s)]
*  I think one thing that we haven't wrestled with is, [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3352.94s)]
*  how would Iran react if Trump offered a worse deal? [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3356.54s)]
*  Because it seems to me that he doesn't actually know [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3359.98s)]
*  the content of the JCPOA, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3362.82s)]
*  the rumors about what might be on the table for North Korea. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3366.06s)]
*  I mean, it would be a real challenge for the regime [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3369.46s)]
*  if signals were to go back that, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3372.2200000000003s)]
*  what did you call it, the TCPOA would look different [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3375.62s)]
*  in a way that is substantially the mirror image [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3378.86s)]
*  of our rhetoric. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3381.38s)]
*  I'm not recommending it. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3383.9s)]
*  All right, well thank you very much, Kareem, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3385.7400000000002s)]
*  Jake, I'm Margaret Brennan from CBS. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3389.62s)]
*  Thank you for all your time. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3392.2200000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3393.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dKy90U-6g&t=3394.38s)]
