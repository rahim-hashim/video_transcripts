Video Description: Arab rulers are increasingly asserting control over Islamic institutions with administrative and coercive tools. These top-down policies are framed by authoritarian regimes as “reforms,” but are often calculated attempts to eliminate potential sources of dissent in ministries, seminaries, mosques, and other religious entities.   At the other end of the spectrum, Islamic institutions in conflict-wracked Arab states have become prizes for competing factions to bolster their authority and popular support.  Understanding these dynamics has important implications for countering violent extremism and resolving conflict, as well as appreciating evolving state-society relations across the Arab world. 
 
Carnegie’s Middle East Program is pleased to invite you to a public discussion marking the release of a new edited volume, Islamic Institutions in Arab States: Mapping the Dynamics of Control, Co-option, and Contention, which examines the interplay between religious establishments and governance in Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Syria, Libya, Egypt, Algeria, and Morocco. 
   
Nathan J. Brown, Maysaa Shuja Al-Deen, and Laila Alrefaai will present the study’s findings, drawing from field research on Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Yemen, and Syria. Annelle Sheline will serve as a discussant and Frederic Wehrey as moderator. 

Research for this project was made possible through a generous grant from the Henry Luce Foundation.

# Ultimate Authority: The Struggle for Islamic Institutions in the Arab World
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [June 08, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo)
*  Good morning from Washington, D.C. I'm Fred Weary, a senior fellow in the Middle East [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=30.0s)]
*  program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. It's my pleasure to welcome you to [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=36.4s)]
*  this panel discussion on ultimate authority, the struggle for Islamic institutions in the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=41.0s)]
*  Arab world. Across the Arab world today, a number of authoritarian regimes are asserting [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=47.2s)]
*  increasing control over their Islamic institutions, broadly defined religious ministries, mosques, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=52.92s)]
*  seminaries, universities, schools, charities, endowments to name but a few. Now these interventionist [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  top-down policies are hardly new in the Arab world, but they've really accelerated in the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=68.16s)]
*  wake of the 2011 Arab uprisings and also in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Domestic [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=74.0s)]
*  threats from Islamic extremists also play a role in these states' policies and especially [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  pressure from the Western patrons and allies of Arab states who've pressured these Arab regimes [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=89.56s)]
*  to tackle militancy under a countering violent extremism rubric. And what these Arab [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=96.68s)]
*  authoritarian regimes are doing is packaging these changes to their Islamic institutions as, quote, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=103.72s)]
*  reforms. But in many instances, these changes are geared toward eliminating political dissent [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=109.64s)]
*  rather than addressing the drivers of extremism. Now in contrast to these strong and cohesive Arab [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=116.36s)]
*  states, in a number of conflict and post-conflict Arab states, Islamic institutions also play a [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=124.92s)]
*  role. They've become prizes for factional contestation. They're seen as sources of popular [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=131.48s)]
*  support, moral authority, and also economic power. Now taken in sum, these dynamics of surrounding [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=137.72s)]
*  Islamic institutions offer an important window into state-society relations in the Arab world [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=145.72s)]
*  and also Western policy priorities in terms of countering violent extremism and also [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  conflict resolution. Now this event marks the culmination of a two-year research effort to look [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=158.28s)]
*  into these dynamics, particularly in Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Syria, Libya, Egypt, Algeria, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=166.28s)]
*  and Morocco. And if you've not done so already, you can download and read the full edited volume [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=173.88s)]
*  on Carnegie's website. We'd like to offer a special thanks to our sponsor, the Henry Luce Foundation, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=179.96s)]
*  for their generous research support to this effort. Now due to time constraints, we can't [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  feature all the amazing authors on this study, but it's my pleasure to welcome a few of them [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=193.16s)]
*  to discuss several important countries in the study. I won't go into their bios. You have those [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=198.84s)]
*  in the invitation. Now Nathan Brown co-authored the chapters on Saudi Arabia and Egypt with Yasmine [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=204.6s)]
*  Farouk and Michelle Dunn respectively. Meysa Shujadeen wrote on Yemen, and Laila Raffaei [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=212.12s)]
*  co-wrote a chapter on Syria with Thomas Pire. And we're also honored to have as a [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=219.24s)]
*  discussant, Anel Shalene of the Quincy Institute, who has looked at these issues in depth, and she [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=226.28s)]
*  also has a forthcoming book on this topic, specifically on religious authority in Arab [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=232.76000000000002s)]
*  monarchies. Now without further ado, Nathan, I'd like to start with you. As I mentioned, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=239.16s)]
*  your chapters covered these enormously consequential Arab states, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=248.44s)]
*  who have enormous influence over Islamic affairs. And in both cases, their so-called reforms have [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=254.68s)]
*  garnered a lot of media attention. But in both cases, the titles that you chose for your chapters [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=261.56s)]
*  suggest that there's more going on here than meets the eye, than the official narratives [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=268.04s)]
*  suggest. Specifically on the Saudi monarchies reforms, you say, quote, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=273.56s)]
*  they are touching nothing but changing everything. And then in tackling in Egypt, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=277.8s)]
*  you pose a very provocative question, quote, who speaks for Islam in Egypt, and who is actually [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=283.88s)]
*  listening? So what's actually going on in these states, and why should we care? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  Nathaniel Well, why should we care is actually a really good question. And it's not something that [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=296.04s)]
*  I automatically cared about it for reasons that you suggest. When we take a look at these [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=304.6s)]
*  institutions, actually, when we take a look at Islam in many Arab countries, at least I used to [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=309.8s)]
*  look past these official institutions, right? What was really interesting were the social [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=315.16s)]
*  and political movements. What was really interesting was all other sorts of things, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=318.84s)]
*  maybe doctrine. But these institutions, we sort of thought, well, they're just mouthpieces of [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=326.28s)]
*  the regime. And sometimes they are, but they do tend to be important. In the Saudi case, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=331.88s)]
*  what we see is a set of institutions that are in the first place very, very big, whatever the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=339.64s)]
*  Saudi state does, whether it's education or adjudication of disputes, or charity and so on, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=345.48s)]
*  institutions, religious actors, official religious institutions come in. And historically, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=352.20000000000005s)]
*  what the Saudi state has done is sort of bottle this off a little bit and allowed it to emerge [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=358.44s)]
*  within its own realm. And what you have right now is a centralizing regime that doesn't necessarily [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=367.08000000000004s)]
*  want to completely change doctrine, right? It doesn't necessarily want to tear down that [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=373.4s)]
*  edifice and construct a new one. What it seems to be doing is through minor regulatory changes, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=381.15999999999997s)]
*  issuing a regulation here, changing responsibility from this ministry to that ministry, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=387.0s)]
*  allowing people with different kinds of degrees to enter certain kinds of professions and so on, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=392.76s)]
*  really with a set of technical changes, fundamentally centralizing this, really, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=398.52s)]
*  I think, with the goal of keeping the religious establishment as it is, but on a very short leash. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=404.59999999999997s)]
*  Each of something different is going on. Again, the religious establishment is huge, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=411.71999999999997s)]
*  even to refer to it as an establishment is probably a misnomer because it's a set of [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=415.4s)]
*  different establishments, you know, over al-Qaaf, over endowments and mosques and education [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=419.88s)]
*  and so on. But again, because it's so big and because it plays all these big social roles, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=426.91999999999996s)]
*  Egyptian state has historically kept a fairly close eye on it. The current regime seems to be [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=436.2s)]
*  very, very anxious to keep most state institutions on a short leash, but these are ones that are [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=443.55999999999995s)]
*  deeply grounded within the society. And so the Egyptian regime really has to figure out not [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=451.24s)]
*  simply how to control these and get them all on message, but also allow them to retain some [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=457.08s)]
*  credibility within the society. And so you have a series of kind of quiet battles and sometimes [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=463.32s)]
*  noisy battles between leaders of the religious establishment among them and then between them [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=469.08s)]
*  and the presidency. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=474.59999999999997s)]
*  Great. Thank you so much, Nathan. Very trenchant and succinct remarks. Mesa, turning it over to [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=483.4s)]
*  you, you wrote a very insightful chapter on your home country, Yemen, the Arab world, fourth country, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=490.67999999999995s)]
*  country wracked by conflict, the site of intense foreign intervention, including from its neighbor [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=498.12s)]
*  to the north. The religious field is of obvious significance. And I think you really drill down [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=504.6s)]
*  into an underappreciated dimension of this war. And that's the role of Islamic institutions, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=511.4s)]
*  specifically educational institutions, with a vast array of schools, seminaries, institutes, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=517.64s)]
*  youth camps that are affiliated with the country's diverse religious and sectarian currents, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=525.4s)]
*  Salafists, Baidi Shias, Sufis, the Muslim Brotherhood. What role are these institutions [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=531.0s)]
*  playing in the conflict? What should policymakers know about them? And what do they tell us about [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=537.16s)]
*  where this country is headed? OK, thank you very much, Fred. First of all, I want to clarify that [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=543.72s)]
*  in my paper, I tried to distinguish between the traditional or the classic religious teaching [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=552.12s)]
*  and the current ones, which start in the mid-70s. And I tried to draw attention to how this religious [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=557.8000000000001s)]
*  teaching has been politicized and now it's being used in mobilizing the people in this war, in this [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=568.44s)]
*  current conflict. And all the regional actors now are involved with the religious groups, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=577.4s)]
*  with the different religious groups, and they use this religious teaching in mobilizing [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=584.28s)]
*  the youth for fighting. So I think if we are talking about the policymakers, definitely, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=590.1999999999999s)]
*  I think the most important thing is how to give the traditional or the classic class of scholars, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=600.52s)]
*  scholarship of the Muslim scholarship, give them the platform instead of the new ones. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=610.04s)]
*  For example, now the Houthis, they push the traditional Zaydi scholars from the public sphere [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=617.5600000000001s)]
*  and they are dominating the religious teaching and they also added their ideas [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=626.2s)]
*  to the official education in Yemen now, in their areas, I mean. And they, for example, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=634.5200000000001s)]
*  the summer camps, they start to do it. This summer camps for children, for teenagers, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=641.32s)]
*  and it's very clear it is for mobilizing the young people to the front line, to fighting. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=648.76s)]
*  This has been used also by the Sunnis to start since the mid-70s. Yemen was two countries, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=657.0s)]
*  socialist and the capitalist in the north, and the north used the Sunni religious schools to [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=665.32s)]
*  counter the communists. Especially, they faced at that time a kind of rebellion or leftist [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=674.0400000000001s)]
*  growl out war in the middle of Yemen. So they counter it by Sunni groups through the education [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=681.16s)]
*  also when they establish an official education dominating by the Brotherhood and then the [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=690.4399999999999s)]
*  Salafis spread their institutes everywhere. Also, the Sufis now start, although the Sufis, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=697.24s)]
*  their general position is to refrain from involving in politics, but some Sufi figures, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=705.72s)]
*  the most probably is Khabib Shafri, and he is supported by the Emiratis and he's involved in [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=712.12s)]
*  politics again. So what I believe that since the war is going on, this kind of religious [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=718.9200000000001s)]
*  teaching will continue because everyone needs it to mobilizing. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=729.16s)]
*  Great, thank you very much. Layla, turning to you, you wrote on Syria, another state where [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=739.7199999999999s)]
*  religious institutions have been, I think, transformed by years of conflict and foreign [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=748.4399999999999s)]
*  influence, and you had a division of labor with Thomas where Thomas looked at the opposition [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=753.24s)]
*  areas, you looked at the Assad-held areas. In both territories, religious governance plays a role. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=758.68s)]
*  There are similarities and differences. If you could unpack those two types of governance going [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=765.4s)]
*  on, and what does that tell us about where this country is headed and the role of religion, I [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=771.0799999999999s)]
*  guess, in mobilizing society and also governing these two disparate areas? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=777.7199999999999s)]
*  I think you're mute. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=789.64s)]
*  Hello, everyone. First of all, on behalf of my co-author and the friend, we thank you, Fred, and [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=795.0799999999999s)]
*  thanks to Carnegie's Middle East Program for having us. We hope you find this presentation [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=805.4799999999999s)]
*  and our paper insightful and valuable. Let me share my screen, please. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=811.08s)]
*  Layla, I think the PowerPoint is ready. I think you can... [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=871.24s)]
*  Do you see it? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=877.4000000000001s)]
*  No, no, it's not showing up right now. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=878.6s)]
*  There we go. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=888.6800000000001s)]
*  I don't think we're seeing it, unfortunately. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=901.08s)]
*  Sorry, sorry for that, Fred. Let me just one second. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=911.48s)]
*  Do you see it now? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=923.24s)]
*  Yes, we see it. Yeah. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=924.9200000000001s)]
*  So, the Syrian conflict, which began 10 years ago as a peaceful uprising fragmented the [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=931.72s)]
*  Syrian into four polities, ruled and controlled by various actors along a separated [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=941.24s)]
*  geographical area. This was reflected in the religious governance of each polity [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=950.12s)]
*  by having its own religious endowment ministry also and its own religious Islamic [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=958.76s)]
*  that means legal religious reference. In the regime controlled area, we don't see [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=969.96s)]
*  specifically a new era of management of Islam, but a continuation and [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=978.8399999999999s)]
*  acceleration of the previous strategies followed by the minister of Muhammad, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=986.5999999999999s)]
*  namely more nationalization of the religious field and more expanding of his ministry, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=995.4s)]
*  both in human and financial means. This got easier by forcing the most respected [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1003.72s)]
*  in exile, clearing the scene only for without a call. Also, it supported his position by law [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1012.84s)]
*  31 in 2018, which reinforced both of influence and say it's personal power. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1023.4s)]
*  The winner of this influence was a say it's on Abdullah, who was appointed in his [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1034.68s)]
*  dad's and grandfather's from a reposition as the director of our car in Tartus and as the [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1042.92s)]

*  of religion into the regime's popular organization promoted a new traditionalist understanding of [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1058.1200000000001s)]
*  Islam, living in Islam and played a political rule supported by this was at expense of the [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1069.96s)]
*  the [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1082.44s)]
*  became merely a subordinate of a say it for then we go to Idlib, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1086.68s)]
*  dominated by HTS, which presents celebration governments as its civil hand. The religious [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1096.92s)]
*  management is highly [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1108.2800000000002s)]
*  and authoritarian. It's under the religious executive body of the government. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1112.8400000000001s)]
*  The ministry is the interest that directly to HTS. Also, the government council is [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1122.2s)]
*  embedded within HTS religious body. The mystery oversees everybody Islamic practices such as mosques [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1135.8000000000002s)]
*  and the richer, richer straining, but also and unlike the other parties, it is involved with [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1147.64s)]
*  the financial and legal matters. However, the controversial practices of governance [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1157.64s)]
*  that is a or a enforcement of religious norms by religious police is commanded directly by HTS. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1167.8000000000002s)]
*  Yes, like Idlib, the religious governance in Turkish country controlled areas is [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1180.76s)]
*  distra leased and fragmented. It's at the center of competition between the Syrian in time [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1193.0800000000002s)]
*  government's authority of endowments and religious affairs supported by the Syrian Islamic Council as [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1203.08s)]
*  on one hand and a couple of directors affiliated with the local councils and founded by the Turkish [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1215.08s)]
*  Diyanet or the other. This was seen in the Islamic educational sector, whether at the level of middle [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1226.1999999999998s)]
*  and high schools or university higher studies. Finally, in the administration of north and [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1236.84s)]
*  east Syria, a highly centralized religious model headed by the people of religions and beliefs [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1248.2s)]
*  and overseen by the Islamic democratic society, Congress as a merger. The latter is also in [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1263.0s)]
*  charge of religious education and charities among other tasks. It promotes an [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1274.52s)]
*  interpretation of Islam in line with the lifted secularist views of the ruling BKK. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1285.56s)]
*  The everyday religious practices are entitled to local religious institutions, but closely [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1295.96s)]
*  supervised by a cadre of religions in domains who control key positions within the Syrian [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1305.8s)]
*  democratic forces. In spite of such differences, there are similarities between the four [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1317.96s)]
*  polities. On one hand, none of the official religious institutions are in position to [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1328.2s)]
*  challenge the political leadership. On the other hand, however, all of the four political regimes [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1337.8799999999999s)]
*  lack financial and symbolic resources which limit their ability to control and [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1347.1599999999999s)]
*  to shape Islam according to their views. Between weakness of political and religious [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1354.6s)]
*  leadership creates room for compromise that is felt differently depending on the region. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1365.32s)]
*  That's all by this remark. I conclude my presentation. Thank you Fred for listening [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1374.6s)]
*  and looking forward to your questions and comments. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1386.04s)]
*  Great. Thanks so much, Leyla, for that extremely granular presentation and I commend you and Thomas [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1392.76s)]
*  for some really insightful work and detailed work on Syria. I'd like to turn now to our [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1400.28s)]
*  discussant, Anel Shalene. She's been given the unenviable task of offering feedback on a seven [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1407.96s)]
*  chapter report. Anel, you saw that we're covering multiple countries in this study and you heard [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1414.84s)]
*  these presentations which cover four of those countries, again, sort of grouping them into [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1424.76s)]
*  types, these two notionally strong, cohesive Arab states centralizing Saudi Arabia and Egypt [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1428.92s)]
*  and two divided conflict rack states. What are the key takeaways from this study in your opinion and [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1436.44s)]
*  if you were telling briefing policy makers, what would you like them to know about the role of [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1446.68s)]
*  religious authority in a very dynamic Arab world and especially regarding this perennial question [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1452.9199999999998s)]
*  of extremism? Thanks so much, Fred. It's really great to get to be here and as I think probably [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1460.04s)]
*  is quite evident, this is a truly rich and impressive body of work, obviously additional [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1469.9599999999998s)]
*  countries that we're not covering in our panel but that are quite thoroughly covered in the [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1477.48s)]
*  work itself so really encourage the audience and everyone to read it. It was really very impressive. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1482.44s)]
*  So, Fred, I'll get to some of your questions perhaps at the end until this question of the [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1493.64s)]
*  role of religious authority and especially policy implications, particularly thinking about [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1500.68s)]
*  the dangers of violent extremism, for example, and just trying to think about some of the general [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1506.04s)]
*  themes that did emerge for me and these are areas that I myself find fascinating so I hope that the [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1513.24s)]
*  panelists will excuse me if I indulge kind of my own area of focus but I was really interested in [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1524.52s)]
*  nationalism and nation building and sort of obviously as Fred, you identify in your intro, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1531.4s)]
*  in the Middle East there's this long history of sort of the interaction between religion and state [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1539.0800000000002s)]
*  and there's been a lot of great scholarship that breaks down those as distinct areas that [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1544.68s)]
*  sort of political science or other fields of scholarship in a sort of a Eurocentric mindset [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1551.0800000000002s)]
*  tend to view those as separate whereas in general in the Middle East they are quite linked because [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1558.28s)]
*  the notion of citizenship is quite tied to the notion of religion, the state controls religious [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1564.6s)]
*  institutions and the process of building the state was often one of building upon existing [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1570.28s)]
*  previously more independent sometimes religious institutions and so again this is not new and so [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1578.2s)]
*  but this work I think really gets into as Fred you said the sort of granularity of what is happening [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1587.8s)]
*  right now it's just so rich in terms of the details and so in general the question then [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1594.9199999999998s)]
*  and if we have time I would really love for the panelists to get into this has to do with the [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1602.76s)]
*  construction of the notion of national identity and the role that religion plays in these various [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1608.6s)]
*  national contexts because what we observed especially following the Arab Spring and the [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1616.12s)]
*  subsequent violence and unfortunately many of these contexts was the threat that Islamists were seen [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1621.1599999999999s)]
*  as posing that the notion that Islamists could perhaps take control whether you know in Egypt [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1627.32s)]
*  through a democratic process or violently as was attempted is sort of on ongoing attempts [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1633.2399999999998s)]
*  for example in Syria, Libya and Yemen and so this notion that the state could benefit from the [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1641.64s)]
*  legitimacy of enhancing a notion of religion as central to identity which I think we had seen [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1651.0s)]
*  especially as sort of the resonance and the salience of Islamic identity had been increasing [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1658.6s)]
*  perhaps through the the late 20th and early 21st centuries well my question is do we think that [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1664.68s)]
*  we're going to see less of an emphasis on that so this is definitely something that came up [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1670.12s)]
*  in Nathan and Yasmeen's chapter on Saudi Arabia for example the extent to which historically [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1674.1999999999998s)]
*  the notion of Saudi national identity as equating to religious identity that they were very much [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1681.2399999999998s)]
*  bound up together and yet now what we've seen more recently is this effort to shift away from that [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1689.2399999999998s)]
*  in fact to emphasize the legitimacy of the Al Saud regardless of the emphasis that they place on [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1694.84s)]
*  religion or the extent to which that they enforce a deeply conservative Wahhabi interpretation of [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1703.72s)]
*  Islam and the effects that that might have. We also saw for example in Misa's fascinating [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1709.1599999999999s)]
*  chapter on Yemen she mentioned how both Salafis and Houthis try to prove their national [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1717.1599999999999s)]
*  credentials and so for example we know that the Houthis legitimating narrative has to do with the [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1724.36s)]
*  notion that they are protecting Yemen from foreign incursions that they represent true Yemen and so [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1731.3999999999999s)]
*  I'd be very interested to hear from Misa how the Salafis are trying to do this as well that they're [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1737.6399999999999s)]
*  articulating perhaps an alternative notion of a Yemeni identity and the role that they are trying [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1743.3999999999999s)]
*  to play in it and trying to assert that they're in fact a more legitimate representation than [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1749.56s)]
*  perhaps the Ansarullah presents. In the case of Egypt there was the Carnegie had just recently [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1755.1599999999999s)]
*  published a few fascinating pieces by Majid or Maigat Mandur in which he talks about how Sisi [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1764.04s)]
*  is equating the Egyptian nation with the military and sort of excluding actual Egyptians who [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1772.92s)]
*  ostensibly would be part of the Egyptian nation but if they are pushing against sort of this [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1779.64s)]
*  notion of Egypt as the military that they are then seen as outsiders even though they are in [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1784.3600000000001s)]
*  fact Egyptian and so I was curious if although I know Nathan did not write that but just thoughts [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1790.3600000000001s)]
*  on the way that Nathan and Michelle did get into the way that Sisi is involved in this process [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1797.6399999999999s)]
*  as are many leaders around the region of trying to articulate this so-called moderate Islam, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1808.28s)]
*  these reforms around Islam and so I'm curious to hear how that plays into the notion of Egyptian [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1813.0s)]
*  nationhood especially given a maigat's emphasis on the role of the military and then to the question [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1820.28s)]
*  of Syria and national identity obviously really appreciated Leila's presentation which as she and [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1827.4s)]
*  her co-author Thomas demonstrated in or as was apparent in their chapter and as was apparent in [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1834.68s)]
*  her PowerPoint it's obviously very complicated and so the PowerPoint was useful to kind of get [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1840.0400000000002s)]
*  a visual sense of these different centers of power and control and so it may not be appropriate to [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1844.76s)]
*  try to think about a national identity for Syria and what role religion plays in that but it is [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1850.36s)]
*  interesting to think what perhaps the absence of that might mean obviously knowing that historically [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1858.6s)]
*  in Syria at least for the past several decades as they talked about in their chapter how sort of the [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1864.6s)]
*  mainstream Sunni Islam you know 80 percent of Syrians who are Sunni rather than than Alawi [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1870.84s)]
*  that that was seen as potentially a threat and so as they talk about in their chapter how [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1882.04s)]
*  historically under Hafez and from the earlier part of Bashar's rule that religion was sort of [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1885.8799999999999s)]
*  de-emphasized decentralized because it was seen as as potentially so threatening to Alawi control [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1894.6s)]
*  so I those are just a few questions at the beginning that and then a few questions that [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1902.44s)]
*  didn't come much come up as much but that I do think are are interesting so what didn't come up [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1909.24s)]
*  or at least what I what didn't come up in in the chapters that I read to prepare for this which are [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1918.68s)]
*  the ones that we're discussing though may have come up in the other chapters was the role of [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1922.84s)]
*  sectarianism you know most of the context that we are talking about here are Sunni other than [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1929.08s)]
*  some you know in Yemen obviously we do see the the Hukis as although as Maisa talks about in [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1935.24s)]
*  her chapter it's there's some contention over whether they are in fact Shia or not it sort of [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1941.72s)]
*  depends who you ask obviously in the case of Syria sectarianism but I think the broader rivalry [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1946.12s)]
*  between Saudi Arabia and Iran which often gets so much attention from U.S. policymakers and I think [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1953.08s)]
*  unfortunately is often the lens through which a lot of people think about this perhaps relying on [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1959.3999999999999s)]
*  that framework more than they ought to and so perhaps I shouldn't be perpetuating that but I [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1966.12s)]
*  was curious about sort of Sunni Shia dynamics which we we know in general have become more [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1972.68s)]
*  salient unfortunately following the U.S. invasion of Iraq and the subsequent [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1978.3600000000001s)]
*  sort of emphasis on on those identities in Iraq and then that's spreading elsewhere around the [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1984.92s)]
*  region and another question that that didn't come up as much were kind of how all of these efforts [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1991.16s)]
*  by state institutions to to control religion to expand their control to influence religious actors [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=1999.0s)]
*  and institutions a lot of that is is kind of on the the supply side you might say here's this [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2008.44s)]
*  top down here's what the state is trying to do in manipulating religion and not as much of an [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2014.52s)]
*  emphasis on the demand side kind of how are these actions interpreted what do people think about [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2019.72s)]
*  them how how are people feeling about the extent to which the state is is trying to shift perhaps [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2026.2s)]
*  its its role in the religious sphere and this is a question I have dealt with in my own work it's [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2033.48s)]
*  obviously very difficult to assess and so I'm not asking for a quick response from from the [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2040.28s)]
*  scholars because that was outside the scope of this project but I do think it is it is certainly [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2046.92s)]
*  an interesting question and Fred you'd mentioned in in the intro work done by my colleague Kadir [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2051.72s)]
*  Yildirim at Rice University's Baker Institute who who not only got into these questions but also [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2057.8799999999997s)]
*  was trying to well did with with help from from Luce did public opinion surveys to try to evaluate [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2063.48s)]
*  public opinion of religious authorities both more sort of official Islam and more sort of independent [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2071.16s)]
*  sources of of Islamic guidance and so so it remains an interesting question and one that I [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2077.4s)]
*  would be very curious to hear what what these authors might have to say one final thing that [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2085.8s)]
*  I noticed was the notion of alternative centers of religious authority so this came up a few times [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2093.32s)]
*  the role of Istanbul as a haven for Islamist opposition I know that this was something Leila [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2100.28s)]
*  had mentioned when she said that some of Syria's most respected ulema have left the country [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2105.24s)]
*  established the proposition Syrian Islamic Council in Istanbul and we we've also observed that in [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2110.4399999999996s)]
*  Egypt many individuals from the Muslim Brotherhood having fled to Istanbul and having established [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2115.7999999999997s)]
*  centers of media that are challenging a lot of sort of the state-sponsored media that that [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2123.9599999999996s)]
*  definitely tends to champion President Sisi coming out of Egypt so I'm I'm and perhaps I [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2129.88s)]
*  I didn't notice this as much in in the case of Yemen but perhaps this is happening as well [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2136.52s)]
*  and I'd be curious to hear Mase's thoughts on that so so those are the common themes now I have a [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2141.48s)]
*  few more if I have time a few more questions for it looks like I have perhaps two more minutes [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2149.0800000000004s)]
*  so I guess one one question for Nathan had to do with the the narrative in Saudi Arabia for [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2156.68s)]
*  for a long time has been this notion that the Al Saud and the religious establishment [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2165.7999999999997s)]
*  rule together and part of why Muhammad bin Salman received so much attention was because he framed [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2170.52s)]
*  himself and many were willing to buy into this frame that he was overturning that dynamic and [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2177.24s)]
*  sort of enforcing the power of the Al Saud on the religious establishment an alternative view [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2182.68s)]
*  would say that in fact the Al Saud have technically been in charge this whole time and when push came [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2189.64s)]
*  to shove the Al Saud would assert control over the religious establishment or over all independent [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2195.56s)]
*  sort of sources of religious authority in Saudi Arabia if they felt threatened by them so I know [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2201.7999999999997s)]
*  Nathan and Yasmeen in their piece do a very careful job to show that a lot of this narrative [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2208.28s)]
*  of religious transformation in Saudi Arabia is in fact much more cumulative as they describe and [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2215.2400000000002s)]
*  might perhaps be temporary these might not actually be lasting changes but I'm curious if [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2222.2000000000003s)]
*  you know Nathan is always so nuanced in his analysis but if he could perhaps try to answer [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2229.0s)]
*  that question of whether he sees this this dynamic historically in Saudi Arabia as being [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2233.64s)]
*  one of relative parity between Al Saud and the religious establishment and whether that has now [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2240.12s)]
*  shifted or if in fact Muhammad bin Salman is merely the latest example of the Al Saud [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2245.3199999999997s)]
*  controlling the religious establishment to a greater or lesser degree throughout Saudi history. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2252.3599999999997s)]
*  I know I just have a couple more minutes so for Misa a final question [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2258.12s)]
*  let me find it I think I would really appreciate if we have time to hear just a little bit more [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2266.52s)]
*  about the Houthi articulation of religious identity and whether they're trying at all [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2276.6800000000003s)]
*  to have that extend to sort of all Yemenis or if they're continuing to sort of view their [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2284.68s)]
*  articulation of religion as really just specific to them and they don't necessarily care if it [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2290.52s)]
*  works if they're making an effort to try to speak for all Yemenis or if that's really not what their [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2296.2s)]
*  project is and so the final question then for Layla on Syria was I guess just to get back [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2302.52s)]
*  I guess just mostly to reiterate this question that I posed at the beginning having to do with [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2312.68s)]
*  a national identity and just her thoughts on clearly the pre-2011 context was one where the [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2316.2s)]
*  Al-Assad regime was quite threatened by the majority of Syrians given that they have a [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2325.24s)]
*  different ethnic identity and so I would love to hear her thoughts on what might be the [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2332.04s)]
*  the role of religion going forward obviously in this current state of fragmentation as I said it [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2337.4s)]
*  is quite difficult to think about that but whether given that Al-Assad has now re-established [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2343.0s)]
*  control as she said in her paper over about two-thirds of the territory of Syria if we think [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2348.92s)]
*  that they are going to try to re-articulate some kind of notion of a religious national identity [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2354.2000000000003s)]
*  for Syrians and if she thinks that could be in any way successful thank you for [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2359.32s)]
*  your time. Thanks so much and now those were I mean really spectacular comments I mean you [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2367.32s)]
*  really you know put the study in a new light I think raised some interesting questions for future [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2373.88s)]
*  research and this notion of the relationship between religion and nation building is just [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2380.36s)]
*  so central in this moment that we're living in right now and I do want to give our panelists [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2385.88s)]
*  time to respond but we're very limited on time so I'm going to ask them to [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2390.76s)]
*  bundle their responses you know in terms of I mean really just one minute two minute [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2395.32s)]
*  responses and again this theme about you know nation building applies to all the different [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2400.36s)]
*  countries we've also got sectarianism Nathan you did address Shia institutions you know the [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2405.8s)]
*  Shia minority in Saudi Arabia I wonder if you could speak a bit on that and then this question [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2412.04s)]
*  of the demand side yeah what does this mean for the constituents for populations how are they [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2418.28s)]
*  receiving these reforms how does that change their perception of of religious figures Nathan [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2423.72s)]
*  you got into that a bit in your paper in terms of the impact of sisi's policies on Egyptian youth [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2429.48s)]
*  and their religiosity so a lot to tackle I want to give our panelists a time to respond so we'll [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2436.04s)]
*  start with you Nathan and please just very briefly okay thank you very much Anel I know you've been [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2441.9599999999996s)]
*  looking at these issues of religious establishments for for a long time and so I was real gratified to [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2448.92s)]
*  hear your remarks yes there's an awful lot going on here and I and I should mention that you know [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2455.0s)]
*  I've been working on Egypt for a long time Saudi Arabia not so long even in in both cases I would [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2460.2000000000003s)]
*  not have been able to do these projects without you know co-authoring Michelle on the Egyptian [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2465.8s)]
*  case and Yasmeen in the Saudi case because the institutional landscape is and the politics is [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2470.12s)]
*  is so complicated I think let me tackle a little bit about Anel's question about Saudi Arabia but [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2477.4s)]
*  also a little bit about Egypt in terms of the relationship between the regime and and the [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2486.92s)]
*  religious establishment there and in a sense I don't see it so much in terms of of parity but [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2494.2000000000003s)]
*  in terms historically of mutual dependence right so regimes recognize they need to do a lot in the [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2501.32s)]
*  religious realm and the religious establishment in both countries is fundamentally comfortable [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2506.52s)]
*  with existing state authority right so so they kind of work together the question is what happens [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2512.84s)]
*  when push comes to shove as you say and I think what we're seeing right now in both countries are [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2518.04s)]
*  leaders who are shoving a lot more than their predecessors did I mean you have extraordinary [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2523.56s)]
*  for instance from Mohammed bin Salman very very recently where he's getting into the [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2531.48s)]
*  authoritativeness of various hadiths I mean and this is not somebody who has who is a religious [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2537.56s)]
*  scholar you have Abdu'l-Fattah Hasisi attempting to lecture the Sheikh Abu Azhar about a similar kind [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2543.3199999999997s)]
*  of set of issues I think what is really at stake in both cases is these are sometimes coupled to [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2549.56s)]
*  very very particular disputes not necessarily about you know I mean they will certainly talk [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2558.52s)]
*  about the struggle against extremism so that they certainly frame it in those terms but sometimes [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2563.64s)]
*  what they want is in in both cases they're both doing things with personal status law they're [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2568.04s)]
*  really looking for kind of micro changes in educational curricula in in in in in in policy [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2573.32s)]
*  towards divorce and so on so it's really it's it really is much less a question I think of of [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2579.8s)]
*  doctrine but rulers who have ambitious agendas and find that the religious establishment is both [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2586.52s)]
*  possibly a tool but also a but but but but but but also possibly an obstacle and so they're [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2593.48s)]
*  basically trying to to work and and and shape it in that way there were an awful lot of other [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2601.4s)]
*  issues raised and I'm I'm I'm mindful of of Fred's injunction to be brief so I'll let that trump all [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2606.7599999999998s)]
*  the other questions but but beg for the opportunity to think about some of some of the great issues [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2613.4s)]
*  you raised now. Great Nathan thank you so much Mesa over to you and again one one minute two [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2619.2400000000002s)]
*  minutes. Okay question of Anel about the Houthis are they trying to expand their discourse to other [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2628.04s)]
*  Yemenis I have to say they have several or multiple light layers of discourse one of them [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2638.04s)]
*  for the public it is political one and it's a change from time to time for example during 2011 [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2645.32s)]
*  they were they represent themselves as the people who are anti Ali Abdullah Saleh and they adopt all [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2653.24s)]
*  the slogans of the uprising at that time then they in the national dialogue conference they [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2661.64s)]
*  change their discourse and they start to talk about the secular state and then and when they [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2669.08s)]
*  start to expand their military expansion to Sana'a they start to say they are fighting the corruption [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2679.64s)]
*  and they attacked the brotherhood in particular at that time because the brotherhood were dominating [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2689.08s)]
*  at that time so they attacked the brotherhood and they said only their only enemy is the brotherhood [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2694.6s)]
*  now their political discourse that we are defending Yemen again is in front of the [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2701.0s)]
*  external aggression and in front of the US and the US so this is the national discourse [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2708.7599999999998s)]
*  and we have another religious discourse which is different somehow and they use that they use them [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2718.2s)]
*  both for example in Ma'arab now when they besiege Ma'arab they use for example some terms like [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2724.92s)]
*  conquest which is them the conquest is always used in the bottles against the non-Muslim [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2731.3199999999997s)]
*  so they talk about that their bottles against Ma'arab as non-Muslim city a non-Muslim place [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2738.2s)]
*  also they say that for example they say for example the national discourse they say that Ma'arab [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2745.0s)]
*  should be under their control because Ma'arab hosts a military base for the Saudis and also [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2750.52s)]
*  say that the Ma'arab they want to unite Yemen to unify Yemen this is another national discourse [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2758.68s)]
*  also they say that Ma'arab is full of ISIS and Qaeda this is a kind of sectarian [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2766.04s)]
*  discourse so another religious discourse that matter they are going to conclude matter [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2774.52s)]
*  and the matter matter people is full of hypocrites and apostates so we have different [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2781.16s)]
*  or multiple layers of discourse and they use them all of them according to the media outlet and to [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2788.4399999999996s)]
*  the public. Thank you Mesa. Leila. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2795.56s)]
*  Thank you Leila for the important question. Actually the Syeds have already started working [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2806.84s)]
*  on that. I have mentioned quickly the Levantine Islam, Islam Shami that is mainly about [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2813.88s)]
*  refuting and refuting the ideologies of the regime in minds considered [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2825.08s)]
*  Muslim Brotherhood Jihadism. I think the Syrians can't now do anything [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2838.2799999999997s)]
*  given the lack of political power but they will wait until the contact is ready to reverse them. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2847.88s)]
*  Great thanks to all of you and thanks to now to prompt some very interesting questions so I'd [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2867.1600000000003s)]
*  like to turn it over to our audience now for questions you can use the chat feature in YouTube [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2873.72s)]
*  you can tweet at us you can ask through the hashtag so the floor is open to our audience. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2879.08s)]
*  There we go. So we've got a couple of questions. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2904.6s)]
*  This is actually I think a very important one that applies I think to all the countries. What is the [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2918.6s)]
*  role of technological advances in terms of shaping these interventions into religious [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2924.6s)]
*  authorities into Islamic establishments and also the impact of technological advances on [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2934.84s)]
*  public perceptions of religious authority and I will add I think this was an important [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2943.08s)]
*  dimension of the pandemic response you know when mosques and physical spaces were closed [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2947.7200000000003s)]
*  you know clerics had to shift to virtual mediums and that I think gave regimes you know greater [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2955.08s)]
*  surveillance capability arguably so again a question on the role of technological advances in all of [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2961.48s)]
*  this. Nathan perhaps over to you on that. I was afraid you'd call on me it's a fantastic [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2967.32s)]
*  question I'm not sure I have a fantastic answer I think what I would say is that what in a sense [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2977.08s)]
*  it has done is open sort of a new field for this battle for authority in the sense that [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2982.52s)]
*  it has become extremely important I mean first older broadcast media certainly were an important [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2990.04s)]
*  avenue for states newer social media have just as it has in all areas of society politics and [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=2995.64s)]
*  certainly for religion offered new avenues which states become extremely mindful of in terms of [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3004.68s)]
*  monitoring and attempting to control so I'm not sure that it is in a sense a new actor but it is [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3013.0s)]
*  probably a new important arena and a place to watch. Very good anyone else want to jump in on this? [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3020.12s)]
*  Okay so we've got a question again from my colleague Michelle Dunn and again this goes back [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3035.24s)]
*  to a question that I had posed to Anel on the policy implications and specifically the [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3041.24s)]
*  countering violent extremism narrative so U.S. and European governments have publicly and privately [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3049.64s)]
*  you know supported a lot of these regimes narrative about you know cleaning up their [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3056.2s)]
*  house that these are needed religious quote reforms and that they're going to have an impact [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3061.32s)]
*  on actual violent extremism and Michelle is asking is that a legitimate strategy from what [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3067.2400000000002s)]
*  we know about these countries and again Nathan over to you but I do want to hear also about [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3073.96s)]
*  the other countries and also Anel if you wouldn't mind jumping in as well. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3081.0s)]
*  Sure and I suspect the situation will be different I mean with Egypt and Saudi Arabia the two cases [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3085.0s)]
*  which I was co-author on these are established states and this is exactly how they speak [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3089.8s)]
*  internationally and they speak domestically as well that we've got a problem with extremism and [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3095.24s)]
*  it is a job of the religious establishment to fight it and I have no doubt that some of this [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3099.32s)]
*  is absolutely sincere. What I would say is that by sort of accepting this a little bit uncritically [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3106.92s)]
*  what governments that are interlocutors with these regimes do is perhaps provide an [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3113.7200000000003s)]
*  umbrella in which far more is going on than simply attempts to counter certain kinds of radical ideas [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3123.88s)]
*  some of which the official religious establishments might not be the most credible way to [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3132.84s)]
*  confront them. They're really these are really as I said before regimes that are shoving hard in all [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3138.1200000000003s)]
*  kinds of area not just on extremism and so a kind of what may appear to be kind of a blanket [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3146.2000000000003s)]
*  and so a kind of what may appear to be kind of a blanket endorsement really is [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3153.1600000000003s)]
*  in effect an endorsement of micromanaging regimes in all kinds of [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3161.56s)]
*  affairs that have very little to do with extremism and violence. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3169.2400000000002s)]
*  Great yeah I will say that this slogan war on terrorism it's this banner [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3173.56s)]
*  Ali Abdullah used it heavily used it to mobilize to monopolize the power at the end of his ruling era [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3182.84s)]
*  then the Houthis they tried to use it actually by justifying themselves at the beginning of the [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3193.1600000000003s)]
*  before this war they start to for example they start to expand to al-Bayda government [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3201.1600000000003s)]
*  which is in the east or in the middle of Yemen and it is very famous for [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3206.76s)]
*  kind of activities there and this is was their first expansion after Sana'a actually [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3211.8s)]
*  and it was under the claim that they are fighting in this government so they tried to use this [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3218.84s)]
*  government so they tried to use this banner to legitimize their expansion but because many [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3226.2000000000003s)]
*  international actors realize that this will be sectorized the situation in Yemen especially as [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3235.1600000000003s)]
*  we know the division in Yemen it is sectarian before it's sectarian it is regional division [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3241.48s)]
*  so they may use it to expand their their their ruling military in regions where the people [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3247.4s)]
*  hate them or there is a resentment against them and this resentment could be represented by [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3257.88s)]
*  a kind of by joining more youth to kind of like what is happening now in Ma'arif for example many [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3263.96s)]
*  people many people are worried from the Houthis if they took this area because it is an armed [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3270.04s)]
*  tribal community so that maybe the resentment against the Houthi will be expressed that the [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3277.16s)]
*  more youths will join Al-Qaeda so Houthis use this banner also the Emiratis use this [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3284.92s)]
*  hevery and they are they still exist they have still forces in Yemen in Shefu actually and they [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3291.88s)]
*  say they would draw from Yemen but they still have some forces in Shefu because they are fighting [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3298.44s)]
*  and everyone is silent about these forces because the international community accepts that the [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3304.6s)]
*  Emiratis led the war against terrorism in Yemen and it's interesting they may use some self- [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3311.48s)]
*  and the most famous incident was when Al-Qaeda took over the biggest government in Yemen in [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3323.56s)]
*  Hadramaut after directly after starting the war in March 2015 and it was it Al-Qaeda would draw [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3329.88s)]
*  from Hadramaut without fighting actually with agreement with the Emiratis and the [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3338.76s)]
*  southern forces that's for them for a very short time it wasn't days actually the [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3347.3999999999996s)]
*  border end so I think the war in terrorism could be used by anyone [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3354.3599999999997s)]
*  to legitimize itself in front of the international community [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3361.48s)]
*  Anel can I turn this question over to you I mean you you wrote your dissertation on [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3369.24s)]
*  the role of religious authority in a number of authoritarian Arab regimes monarchies and so I [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3374.04s)]
*  think this question is you know is quite pertinent to the things you studied as well so definitely [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3379.48s)]
*  well you know I as as Michelle she asked is this a legitimate strategy for US and European [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3386.36s)]
*  governments to support Arab governments narrative about these efforts of reforming religious [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3393.0s)]
*  institutions try to combat extremism I think it's a question of well legitimate for who [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3399.96s)]
*  because I think it as as Mesa was pointing out as as Nathan was pointing out as well this [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3404.4399999999996s)]
*  this serves the agendas of these governments usually quite effectively in the case of Yemen [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3411.16s)]
*  as Mesa was saying we've seen sort of efforts especially under Ali Bella Sala to sort of [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3418.4399999999996s)]
*  emphasize the threat of violent extremists in order to attract counterterrorism dollars even [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3423.7999999999997s)]
*  though he himself was not actually primarily threatened by by al-qaeda necessarily he had a [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3429.0s)]
*  lot of different things he was trying to manage and as as Nathan said a lot more is going on when [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3435.24s)]
*  we observe this than just countering violent extremism it is often about targeting the [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3442.04s)]
*  political opposition which does tend to be Islamist in many of these cases and so the the question of [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3447.48s)]
*  certainly it's a legitimate strategy for these governments because it works for them but whether [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3454.04s)]
*  it's a legitimate strategy for for the US and EU I think is the real question here and in general [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3459.32s)]
*  I I don't you know when when the United States for example gets involved in trying to promote [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3466.92s)]
*  so-called moderate Islam usually does undermine it because it is seen as this sort of western [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3472.6s)]
*  imposition you know soon after 9 11 we had a lot of emphasis on so-called like [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3478.12s)]
*  Blair Bush Islam people like Peravez Musharraf talking about this need for enlightened [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3483.56s)]
*  moderation and and it was very apparent to to citizens of these contexts that all of this was [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3488.8399999999997s)]
*  because these governments were really worried that they were going to be to be painted in the same [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3494.44s)]
*  brush as sort of Saddam Hussein was painted and that they might be subject to overthrow if the [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3499.24s)]
*  Americans decided to go after them after Iraq so so in general I think the United States and and [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3504.28s)]
*  obviously we we saw you know efforts by people like Peter Mandaville who was in government who [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3511.2400000000002s)]
*  was really trying to problematize a lot of this non-critical taking up the notion of oh we just [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3516.0400000000004s)]
*  have to work with these religious institutions and that's how we're going to solve violent extremism [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3522.2000000000003s)]
*  and he and and Peter trying to emphasize that look it doesn't work that way and when we get [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3527.4s)]
*  involved that can actually make these efforts less effective and we this might have unintentional [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3531.8s)]
*  effects especially of of sort of bolstering the authority of these traditional you know [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3536.1200000000003s)]
*  visible centers of religious authority and actually marginalizing the more sort of dynamic [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3541.32s)]
*  grassroots voices and so just in general I I hope that that moving forward the United States will [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3546.44s)]
*  understand that kind of similar to what we observed during the Cold War that that leaders [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3556.2s)]
*  around the world are aware of of these big security agendas of actors like the United States and they [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3562.52s)]
*  will use them for their own purposes and so the I think the U.S. needs to be aware of the effects [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3568.2s)]
*  that our our big ticket sort of security agenda can have elsewhere and how how the United States [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3575.0s)]
*  can be manipulated. Great thanks so much and now those are great points I think a great point to [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3580.2s)]
*  wrap up our discussion we are coming to the end of our of our session unfortunately I want to thank [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3587.7999999999997s)]
*  our three panelists for you know very rich illuminating summaries of of in-depth research [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3595.0s)]
*  and again I want to refer our audience to the full Carnegie report which is on the Carnegie website. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3601.64s)]
*  I want to thank our audience for for tuning in and posing some very interesting questions this [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3608.04s)]
*  is hardly the final word on this topic so with that goodbye from Washington please enjoy the [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3612.44s)]
*  rest of your day wherever you are. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpseOHhlWxo&t=3618.44s)]
