*  to all three of you and thank you for joining us this afternoon. Again just to repeat after our [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=192.72s)]
*  panel discussions we'll open up for questions so please remember questions are open from now so [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=199.92s)]
*  please feel free to submit your questions even during the panel discussion as I mentioned by [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=206.24s)]
*  email or via the YouTube chat. So thank you to the three of you for joining. We're going to dive [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=211.68s)]
*  right in straight away and turn to you Sharif El-Ashmehwi to discuss Libya. The conflict in [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=217.60000000000002s)]
*  Libya obviously has shifted dramatically in recent weeks. How would you, how do you view [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=226.56s)]
*  Egypt's assessment of the current situation and their priorities in regards to the conflict? Would [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=235.2s)]
*  you argue that Haftar is still a major part of the policy or no longer? Well thank you Hafsa, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=241.36s)]
*  it's a real pleasure to be on this panel. I think to understand Egypt's concerns regarding [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=248.96s)]
*  Libya I think we need to remember that Libya is the only country in North Africa and arguably in [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=256.32s)]
*  the MENA region as well where the post-2011 Arab Spring questions remain unsettled. These relate [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=262.96s)]
*  to the ideological orientation of the political establishment, the foreign alliances and the model [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=271.52s)]
*  of governance and there remains a great deal of fluidity in Libya which partly explains the kind [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=277.68s)]
*  of regional competition that we've been seeing over the past decade and are playing out more [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=285.2s)]
*  intensely now as we speak in order to shape the future of Libya. So just to give a sort of a very [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  quick summary of the changing dynamics in the Libyan conflict. So over the past two months we've [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=298.96s)]
*  seen a complete reversal of the tides as the forces aligned with the government of national [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=306.0s)]
*  accord in Tripoli supported by Turkish drones, equipment and fighters slash mercenaries were [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=311.76s)]
*  able to force the Libyan national army which is Egypt's ally to retreat from northwestern Libya [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=320.56s)]
*  which effectively meant the end of the Tripoli offensive that was launched in April 2019 [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=327.12s)]
*  by the Libyan national army to capture the capital Tripoli. The result of this was that the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=335.44s)]
*  government of national accord aligned groups became on the offensive now with ongoing attempts to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  build on the momentum to capture more territory in central and eastern Libya at the expense of [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=348.8s)]
*  the LNA. Specifically now this is playing out around the areas of Sirte on the central coastal [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=355.44s)]
*  on central coastal in central coastal Libya as well as the central Joufra district. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=363.84s)]
*  So the way Egypt views this development is definitely with a great deal of concern. It has [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=369.44s)]
*  invested significant capital in its relationship with the LNA since 2014 as a security partner on [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=376.64s)]
*  its western border and now it's seeing these forces collapsing in the advancing [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=385.67999999999995s)]
*  in the face of the advancing GNA aligned groups with potential ramifications [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=392.4s)]
*  for the cohesiveness of the LNA in eastern Libya as well and it's also seeing a plethora of militias [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=398.96s)]
*  affiliated with the GNA including Islamist elements that are hostile to Egypt because of its [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=404.88s)]
*  support to the to the LNA in recent years advancing eastwards and backed by regional rivals of Egypt [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=411.2s)]
*  mainly Turkey and to a lesser extent Qatar. So in terms of Egypt's priorities I think there are two [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=419.03999999999996s)]
*  key priorities. First of all is security. The security of the 1200 kilometer border that [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=425.04s)]
*  separates Egypt from Libya which has been a hot spot of smuggling activity and militant infiltration [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=431.44s)]
*  since 2011 which affected security in the western desert of Egypt as well as in north [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=438.96000000000004s)]
*  Sinai and Egypt in recent years has made a lot of progress in sort of cracking down on the cross [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=445.84000000000003s)]
*  border smuggling activity which has been reflected in the improvement in the security environment in [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=452.96s)]
*  the western desert but also in reduced which reduced the weapons smuggling that reached the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=460.0s)]
*  Sinai peninsula and this is now coming to the fore again with the potential for instability in [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=466.64s)]
*  eastern Libya. Part of this security of tens of thousands of Egyptian workers who are based in [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=472.08s)]
*  Libya and we've seen a flavor of that already with the detention and mistreatment of a number [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=478.96s)]
*  of Egyptians in the town of Tarhuna in the northwest earlier this month which before the [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=484.71999999999997s)]
*  issue was resolved later. Another key priority I think is ensuring that the political order in [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=491.12s)]
*  eastern Libya is not hostile to Cairo to Egypt. Egypt is wary of having a government controlling [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=497.59999999999997s)]
*  eastern Libya and that government having Islamist tendencies and the Turkish and Qatari support which [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=505.28s)]
*  would have of course political and security ramifications for Egypt down the road. Also the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=512.0s)]
*  significance of the cert Joufra red line that President Sisi communicated during his speech [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=518.24s)]
*  last weekend is that if the GNA captures the city of certs it would easily take control of the oil [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=525.04s)]
*  ports which is called the oil crescents and the cert basins oil fields and this would be a [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=532.16s)]
*  major gain for the LNA and would just because oil is one of the last cards that the LNA and the eastern [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=539.6s)]
*  authorities still have against to hold against the GNA given the ongoing oil blockades since [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=547.04s)]
*  January this year which has reduced the flow of revenue to the GNA. So just the last part or the [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=554.7199999999999s)]
*  last point that I want to raise is about whether Haftar is still part of the policy or not and I [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=561.92s)]
*  think in the past few weeks we've seen indications that there is an increasing frustration with Haftar [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=567.92s)]
*  from Egypt and from the other foreign backers of the LNA. His importance will be less pronounced [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=575.8399999999999s)]
*  now as there is a significant focus on the potential for a political solution [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=582.3199999999999s)]
*  and in Sisi's speech I think we all noticed that he talked about the Libyan tribes and said that [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=586.48s)]
*  Egypt would arm and train Libyan tribes which effectively bypasses the LNA and gave an [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=593.5200000000001s)]
*  indication about how Cairo views Khalifa Haftar at the moment. I would say the LNA still matters [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=600.96s)]
*  and it's early to know whether there will be a change in its leadership or not. Definitely [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=608.1600000000001s)]
*  succession will be tough because it will need and sort of require a mutual understanding and an [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=614.08s)]
*  agreement between a multitude of Libyan actors but also foreign supporters of the LNA and the [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=621.0400000000001s)]
*  eastern authorities. I think more generally there would be a more focus on the political track [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=627.2s)]
*  where someone like Agila Salah the head of the parliament the house of representatives in eastern [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=632.72s)]
*  Libya would play a more important role than the role played by Khalifa Haftar. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=638.64s)]
*  Thank you very much. You've hinted towards the implications of both the Cairo initiative and [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=647.1999999999999s)]
*  Sisi's recent statement last Saturday to troops and they would appear to both simultaneously [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=655.04s)]
*  propose de-escalation whilst at the same time threatening direct intervention. How do you [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=661.4399999999999s)]
*  assess the Egyptian position with regards to the priorities you've outlined? Is military conflict [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=668.56s)]
*  inevitable? Yeah I mean I don't necessarily see a contradiction between the Cairo initiative that [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=674.64s)]
*  was laid out earlier this month and President Sisi's speech last weekend. In fact they go both [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=684.7199999999999s)]
*  hand in hand I think there's a significance in the sequence of Egypt's moves in recent weeks. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=693.1999999999999s)]
*  First was the Cairo declaration on the 6th of June regarding a political solution in Libya [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=698.0799999999999s)]
*  along the lines of the initiative that was already proposed by the head of parliament Agila Salah [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=705.04s)]
*  in April and then came Sisi's speech and the threat of intervention and this followed the fact [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=710.9599999999999s)]
*  that the initiative the earlier initiative was rejected by the GNA which gave indication and the [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=719.52s)]
*  GNA gave indications that it will it is committed to go ahead with its plan to enroach on the LNA [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=724.88s)]
*  held territories in central and eastern Libya. So then came Sisi's speech and the threat of [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=734.32s)]
*  intervention and the goal here was really to communicate Egypt's priorities and interests [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=740.96s)]
*  and red lines and the fact that it would not tolerate a transfer of the conflict from western [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=747.2s)]
*  Libya to eastern Libya near the Egyptian borders. More broadly I think Egypt prefers a political [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=753.6s)]
*  solution to the ongoing conflict based on the current territorial control lines [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=760.32s)]
*  mainly with that line being drawn in central Libya as Sisi has mentioned. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=768.88s)]
*  I think more I mean it's given the difficult nature of the Libyan conflict itself and the likely [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=776.8000000000001s)]
*  difficult exit from it I think Egypt doesn't prefer to intervene militarily and [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=782.32s)]
*  its priority is to find the political solution to the to the conflicts again along the [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=790.08s)]
*  based on the current territorial lines but also because Egypt doesn't like to sort of [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=795.84s)]
*  involve its army in extensive foreign missions and we've seen that already in 2015 with the Yemen [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=803.28s)]
*  and with the war in Yemen but also the signal that it wanted to give I mean the main message [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=809.12s)]
*  of the threat is to signal to the GNA side and to Turkey but also to the international community [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=816.88s)]
*  that Egypt is prepared to deploy troops of Libya to protect the interests of the [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=825.04s)]
*  of Libya to protect its interests in case its initiative or its peaceful initiative or sort of [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=831.92s)]
*  proposal is not accepted by the GNA and Turkish sides. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=841.36s)]
*  Thank you and just finally talking about sort of the you've talked very well about the sort [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=848.64s)]
*  of legitimate national security concerns for Egypt and the real need to ensure for them that [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=855.04s)]
*  the political order or the political leadership in the east is not in their view influenced by [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=861.68s)]
*  Islamists looking at the red line specifically in the Sertz Jofra area that's been outlined and you [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=868.48s)]
*  mentioned very clearly that the oil crescent is in part a major part of that reasoning. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=874.88s)]
*  Do you think there's room within a political negotiation or ceasefire settlement where [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=884.4000000000001s)]
*  these areas Sertz Jofra and the oil crescent are up for negotiation in any way or do you think that [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=890.8000000000001s)]
*  those red lines are really set in stone for Egypt to protect its interests? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=897.44s)]
*  Yeah I think that's a good question I mean the signs we've seen from the GNA so far [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=904.8000000000001s)]
*  are they are committed to just build on the momentum that they've had and continue their [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=910.5600000000001s)]
*  effort to control Sertz and Jofra and possibly move beyond that to the eastern oil fields and [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=919.6s)]
*  that's a key concern for the GNA because as I mentioned since January 2020 there has been this [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=927.6s)]
*  LNA-led blockade of oil exports from Libya and that has really hurt the revenue that [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=935.1999999999999s)]
*  the GNA is getting from oil sales. Again the oil and gas is the major [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=942.9599999999999s)]
*  sort of source of foreign currency income for Libya so one of its goals is to take control of [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=948.8s)]
*  these oil fields in order to restart oil production and exports and again that's to Egypt is a red [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=956.88s)]
*  line as Cici has mentioned. I mean generally I would say more instability in eastern Libya [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=963.04s)]
*  means more smuggling activity and potential infiltration of militants and terrorist elements [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=971.36s)]
*  into Egypt which is why Egypt is acting this way. I mean also preventing a hostile environment [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=977.68s)]
*  a hostile sorry a hostile government that controls eastern Libya and that has Islamist elements [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=985.04s)]
*  that enjoy again enjoy support from Turkey and Qatar is a major priority for Egypt and also [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=992.32s)]
*  if we look at the sort of controversial maritime demarcation agreement between Turkey and the GNA [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1000.72s)]
*  last November it also concerns a short part of the coastline in eastern Libya further with Egypt and [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1008.72s)]
*  its implementation would potentially upset Egypt's ambitions in the east med [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1016.32s)]
*  gas dynamics that we're seeing at the moment. Also I mean these concerns since 2014 were the [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1025.68s)]
*  driver behind the fact that Egypt has supported the LNA since then just given Haftar's anti-Islamist [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1035.28s)]
*  anti-Muslim brotherhood agenda and his efforts to fight local and transnational militants and [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1042.16s)]
*  terrorist groups in Derna and Ben-Ghazi which have been a major concern for Egypt and the security [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1048.4s)]
*  of the border. I think more recently Haftar's military defeat in western Libya compels Egypt [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1055.52s)]
*  to move beyond Haftar to engage with a wider range of military actors to ensure an adequate [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1063.52s)]
*  political and military order and a stable one more importantly in eastern Libya and through [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1071.1200000000001s)]
*  fostering a political solution that kind of preserves the status quo as we see it at the moment. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1076.3200000000002s)]
*  Thank you very much Shalif. I have no doubt that we will return again to Libya as the discussion [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1086.24s)]
*  goes on. Moving slightly and to Shalif Moheddin, the insurgency obviously in North Sinai continues [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1094.4s)]
*  along with a complete halt of tourism after the lockdowns were introduced with the global economy [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1107.76s)]
*  downturn with the Covid pandemic. Could you just outline what the current status of Sinai communities [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1114.88s)]
*  and tribes are both as they relate to the pandemic and the security situation in the area? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1123.6s)]
*  Just having some tiny technical issues, I'm muting. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1141.12s)]
*  Shalif are you able to unmute yourself? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1154.32s)]
*  Okay we're just going to shift things around a bit. We're having a tiny technical difficulty [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1165.12s)]
*  and move to just as an important issue Ethiopia and the Gerd and Mahmoud. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1175.1999999999998s)]
*  Sorry Mahmoud thank you. Very briefly there's been a flurry of activity not just in the last few [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1184.0s)]
*  weeks but in the last several months on Gerd and could you just give us an update on where the [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1192.3999999999999s)]
*  parties stand on negotiations over the dam? We've seen the collapse of the Washington process and [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1200.0s)]
*  the internal tripartite process last week and the UN Security Council appeal. What are your [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1205.76s)]
*  expectations in the coming weeks prior to a fill on the the summer 2020 reservoir fill for the dam? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1212.08s)]
*  First thank you Hafsa, thank you for having me and it's really an honor and pleasure to be with you [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1222.96s)]
*  and to see you. Let me start with a very brief background about the negotiations and what happened [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1228.8s)]
*  since the collapse of Washington negotiations. Basically the Washington negotiations [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1236.64s)]
*  stopped or collapsed in late February of this year. Since then Sudan has played a significant [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1244.96s)]
*  role to bring all the parties together. They asked both Ethiopia and Egypt to come to negotiations [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1251.76s)]
*  again and they provided like a paper or an agreement based on the points that the three [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1258.8s)]
*  parties agreed on in Washington process. The three parties come to the started negotiations again [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1270.0s)]
*  early this June and for the first time in the negotiation they had observers [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1279.04s)]
*  from the EU and from South Africa. Previously they had the World Bank and the US but this time they [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1288.8799999999999s)]
*  had also observers from the European Union and South Africa as the head of the African Union. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1296.6399999999999s)]
*  However after this last round of negotiations the negotiation failed for three reasons. The first [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1303.1999999999998s)]
*  reason is that the three parties couldn't agree on the legality of the agreement. Egypt and Sudan [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1310.7199999999998s)]
*  wanted to want a binding agreement that includes a resolution mechanism for any future problems [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1317.52s)]
*  for any future problems but Ethiopia rejected that. Also Egypt and Sudan wanted to include [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1325.2s)]
*  a mitigation measures for drought and too long dry dry years and also Ethiopia rejected that. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1333.12s)]
*  The one thing that was kind of new in the last round of negotiations that Egypt wanted to [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1341.28s)]
*  add or to mention its historical rights, its historical water rights in the agreement [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1349.2s)]
*  and Ethiopia firmly rejected that and said that they basically they are negotiating [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1359.12s)]
*  the water, the Renaissance dam operation not anything else. To go back to your question of [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1366.8799999999999s)]
*  like where is the stand, where is each country and what is the current stand. Basically [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1375.6s)]
*  the three countries, let me start with Ethiopia first. Ethiopia affirmed several times that they're [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1383.68s)]
*  going to fill the reservoir of the Renaissance dam whether they have an agreement with Egypt or [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1391.36s)]
*  Sudan or not. Also Ethiopia moved the heavily military equipment near the Renaissance dam [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1398.64s)]
*  and its deputy army chief said that the country will defend itself over the dam and he also added [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1407.3600000000001s)]
*  that Egyptians and the rest of the world knows too well how we conduct war whenever it comes. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1415.6000000000001s)]
*  So this is kind of like an increase or like a more hostile environment between the three countries [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1422.32s)]
*  when it comes to using military force. Just for a very historical note Egypt and Ethiopia had two [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1430.8s)]
*  wars in history. One of them was in 1875 and the second one was 1876 and Egypt lost both wars. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1438.56s)]
*  To go back to and also in the same line within like the militarizing the talks between the [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1448.24s)]
*  countries, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said like he met with the early this month in June. He met with [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1456.96s)]
*  the generals from the army and he said like the main idea was to discuss new defense [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1469.44s)]
*  strategy and early this year in January or February he mentioned in a speech in the [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1476.08s)]
*  Ethiopian parliament that if and he said specifically if there is a need to go to war [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1484.6399999999999s)]
*  we could get millions threaded. And that was the kind of that talks when it comes to military. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1492.08s)]
*  So we have and the third point from Ethiopia that there is some change [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1501.28s)]
*  in the negotiations. They have basically they have been talking for years about electricity [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1509.36s)]
*  in recent weeks. We have been seeing some change both in the Ethiopian media as well in the [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1515.52s)]
*  as well as in the government official interviews they mentioned that they also need part of from [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1524.32s)]
*  the water. That was never an issue before. This might be a card that the Ethiopian government is [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1533.1999999999998s)]
*  using to make pressure on the Sudanese and the Egyptians and it might be a genuine [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1544.0s)]
*  request from them that they need part from the water. They also mentioned this in the [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1553.6s)]
*  UN Security Council letter that they submitted early this month or like not early this month, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1558.0s)]
*  like few days ago. They mentioned that they don't get any water from the from the Blue [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1564.32s)]
*  Nile and they want to have part from this water. So this is where Ethiopia stands. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1570.32s)]
*  To go to Egypt and where Egypt stands right now we have basically three points [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1576.8000000000002s)]
*  that can summarize Egypt's stand. First that Egypt wants an agreement before filling. They said that [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1585.76s)]
*  several times President Sisi said it. The Foreign Ministry said it several times that there [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1594.88s)]
*  will be no filling without an agreement. This is the first point. The second point is Egypt [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1603.2s)]
*  submitted a letter to the UN Security Council asking them to interfere to affirm the importance [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1610.24s)]
*  of the three conflict to resume the negotiations. They didn't ask, Samah Choukri said in an interview [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1617.76s)]
*  that they don't want the Security Council to take any sanctions against Ethiopia. They just want [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1625.44s)]
*  them to ask them to go back to negotiations again. So this is the second point. The third [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1632.32s)]
*  point is that President Sisi, as you might all know, visited a military base a few days ago [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1641.6799999999998s)]
*  and he mentioned both Ethiopia and Libya in his speech and he said and he urged the army [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1648.24s)]
*  to be ready to accomplish any missions whether here within the borders of Egypt or [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1656.96s)]
*  outside if needed. So this is also one of the things that Egypt is like hinting or giving us [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1664.0s)]
*  signals that they can use force if needed. When it comes to Sudan, this is the standard. So then this [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1673.68s)]
*  then witnessed the most significant, Sudan was like the country that witnessed most significant [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1684.08s)]
*  change during the period from since the collapse of the Ashantan process up until now. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1691.76s)]
*  Sudan for years have been leaning toward the Ethiopia side. It has been always like [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1697.52s)]
*  like sympathized or supporting Ethiopia whether they said it publicly or not. The Sudanese media [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1706.56s)]
*  used to support the Ethiopian side most of not all the time. We have seen a significant change in this. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1713.4399999999998s)]
*  Sudan recently since, how to say, since May they started to [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1722.0s)]
*  to basically be as close as possible to Egypt side. They said that they don't want [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1728.56s)]
*  first filling without an agreement. They rejected Ethiopia's offer several times to come to [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1739.04s)]
*  like to come to an agreement between Ethiopia and Sudan without Egypt. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1746.6399999999999s)]
*  They rejected negotiations between Ethiopia and Sudan without Egypt. So they basically tried and [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1751.0400000000002s)]
*  they submitted early this morning, they submitted a letter to the UN Security Council arguing [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1756.4s)]
*  that the three countries should come again to negotiations and no country should take a [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1764.8000000000002s)]
*  So this is where the three parties stand at the moment. The second part of your question of what [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1771.76s)]
*  is the possible the expectation prior the possible reservoir filling, I think there are like three [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1776.6399999999999s)]
*  possible things that can happen during the upcoming few weeks. First, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1783.28s)]
*  or the expectations. First, Egypt will try to win support as much as possible for the [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1790.6399999999999s)]
*  future of the country. The second part of your question is what is the [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1794.0s)]
*  expectation prior to the possible reservoir filling. I think there are like three [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1799.04s)]
*  upcoming few weeks. First, or the expectations. First, Egypt will try to win support as much [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1805.28s)]
*  as possible from both African and international players to win diplomatic support that can make [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1812.3999999999999s)]
*  pressure as much as possible in Ethiopia not to stop them from the first filling. Second, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1818.9599999999998s)]
*  we are waiting for this, the UN Security Council resolution which would be very, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1827.3600000000001s)]
*  it's not going to be binding. It's very unlikely to be binding [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1835.68s)]
*  solution or resolution from the Security Council, but it's going to be a step forward towards [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1842.64s)]
*  like asking the parties to come again to an agreement. The third expectation that Ethiopia [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1851.92s)]
*  will try to win Sudan back again. They have been trying and they have been trying, they had this [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1858.72s)]
*  visit for Hamid to Ethiopia a few days ago. So Ethiopia will try as much as possible to win Sudan [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1863.44s)]
*  back and we'll see whether Sudan will accept the offers or not, but it's not very clear and it's [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1872.48s)]
*  very unlikely that Sudan will go back, especially if we kept in mind the tensions, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1877.76s)]
*  the military tensions between the two countries in the south of Sudan, between Ethiopia and Sudan. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1882.4799999999998s)]
*  Thank you very much Mahmoud. And just building a little bit on that, the Sudanese have been really [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1890.4799999999998s)]
*  quite clear in the Arab League and in other forums that they really want to avoid an [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1897.28s)]
*  Arab-African war as they call it or any kind of conflict. As you mentioned, we've seen Ethiopia [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1902.48s)]
*  mass troops around the dam structure and towards the border and Egypt has been effectively [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1909.28s)]
*  flexing its muscles, but it can engage militarily. The rainy season is set to begin in a matter of [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1915.52s)]
*  weeks and without predicting what you think definitely will or won't. Just very, very quickly, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1923.52s)]
*  because I want to ask about the water security issue as well, do you think that any sort of [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1934.8s)]
*  military engagement on either side is possible? I think for Egyptians it is. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1942.32s)]
*  I don't think the regime can deal with a water crisis. Water crisis for Egypt is basically [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1954.48s)]
*  no one can afford this. Just to give you a very, very small number to show you how Egypt is [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1966.0s)]
*  really way below the water poverty line. The water poverty line is that each person should have at [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1974.8799999999999s)]
*  least 1,000 cubic meters per year. And we have Egypt, its population is 100 million and they [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1987.28s)]
*  receive 55 million cubic meters. So if we do this math between the numbers, between the water that [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=1999.84s)]
*  Egypt receives and the populations, Egypt is way, way below the international poverty line. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2008.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't think at all that Egypt, no matter how strong or brutal the regime is, can afford to [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2018.08s)]
*  silence people when it comes to water. Just to give you very, very small, like the two examples, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2026.8s)]
*  the first one is that when they asked Sadat about the same issue in the late 70s, he said that I'm [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2034.32s)]
*  not going to watch my people die here, I will take them and die there. So this is just to give you a [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2042.72s)]
*  context of how the Egyptians, like through the history and the current regime that basically [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2049.52s)]
*  successor to previous regimes come from the same ideology or from the same background. It's one of [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2057.92s)]
*  the main things in Egypt, national security water is one of the main, main things. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2065.52s)]
*  Indeed. And just very, very quickly, obviously one of the arguments is that, as you mentioned, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2071.6s)]
*  water poverty, water insecurity is a major issue, one that will continue to be, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2083.7599999999998s)]
*  one that will continue to be in the country regardless of the dam issue. It will continue to [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2088.96s)]
*  have questions over water efficiency, usage, wastage, etc. are certainly very much a part of [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2099.84s)]
*  the national discourse and debate, but also climate change and then our waters. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2108.2400000000002s)]
*  How do you see Egypt's water security policy has evolved in recent years and how would you describe [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2114.6400000000003s)]
*  the response to water insecurity domestically? Okay, just to start with laying out what is the [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2120.24s)]
*  problem when it comes to water security in Egypt and to Egypt problems with climate change. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2130.0s)]
*  The problem we can summarize in a very few points. For years, as I mentioned earlier, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2137.3599999999997s)]
*  Egypt is already under the water poverty line when it comes to water. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2146.0s)]
*  So for years, for decades I would say, Egyptian regimes have been like giving, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2154.16s)]
*  they've been an extreme pool management, pool water management in Egypt. We have an irrigation [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2160.88s)]
*  system that is the same as ancient Egyptian. Nothing changed, no modernization whatsoever [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2168.72s)]
*  when it comes to the irrigation system, which takes more than 80% from Egypt's water. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2178.56s)]
*  This is for a second, water used to be almost for free in Egypt until like maybe like 10 or [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2185.8399999999997s)]
*  15 years ago they started to have price on water. Before that it was almost free for everyone. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2192.96s)]
*  Irrigation canals that people used to have water that goes to farms and [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2200.7200000000003s)]
*  places that British created more than 100 years ago, no one did anything to modernize it or to [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2207.76s)]
*  sustain it in any way. And when it comes, and also to add to this, Egypt Delta, which is the northern [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2215.6800000000003s)]
*  part of Egypt, is already just one meter above the sea water. So Egypt is already in a very bad [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2225.04s)]
*  situation when it comes to water management. The current government or the current regime has been [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2232.4s)]
*  taking several steps to overcome these challenges. The first thing that the current regime or the [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2239.52s)]
*  current government has been doing is that the parliament approves several laws to ban cultivation [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2248.8s)]
*  of certain crops that takes lots of water such as rice in certain areas in Egypt. Also the current [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2254.24s)]
*  government built a lot of desalination plants and to give you a number, to show you what is the [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2262.48s)]
*  difference between how much of the desalination plants have been built, Egypt used to have 80,000 [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2270.08s)]
*  cubic meter per year from the desalination plant before the current government. Now it has almost [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2279.6s)]
*  800,000. So this has been the increase from 80,000 to 800,000 cubic meters. Also Egypt started [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2286.48s)]
*  this program, the current government announced this in early 2018 that they're going to use the [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2297.12s)]
*  irrigation water at least three times. And the water is being used in the region, and the [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2303.68s)]
*  they're going to use the irrigation water at least three times. And the final thing that the [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2312.2400000000002s)]
*  government is doing is that they announced in 2018 that they're going to modernize the irrigation [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2320.32s)]
*  system in Egypt in 10 years. They started this program and it's not clear what is the progress [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2326.88s)]
*  in the program that they announced and to modernize the irrigation system, but this is [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2336.08s)]
*  what they said in 2018. My opinion to end with this, my opinion is that the government is [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2344.08s)]
*  taking steps, it's very, very, very small compared to the problem. The problem is quite huge and it's [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2352.64s)]
*  even, I would say, like it's way even bigger than Libya. And because like as I mentioned, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2360.64s)]
*  like Egypt is basically nothing without water. If you don't have water in Egypt, it would be all [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2367.44s)]
*  desert and people, like the economy and everything would be most likely collapse. So I think the, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2371.52s)]
*  and also add to this, the population growth and how that eats from the water ratio that it's [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2378.64s)]
*  already limited or it's already very small to Egypt. So I think the government is taking [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2384.7999999999997s)]
*  steps but still very, very way to go. Thank you very much to Sharif, to sorry Mahmoud and [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2390.3999999999996s)]
*  moving to Sharif. Just before I ask Sharif to come in, just a reminder that you can submit your [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2400.72s)]
*  questions as and when, as I said, by email at middleeast.ceip.org or in the chat box [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2406.0s)]
*  on next to the YouTube screen. So Sharif, thank you and thank you for your patience while we [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2415.12s)]
*  sorted that technical difficulty. So just to start again, moving now back to marginalized communities [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2423.36s)]
*  and starting in the Sinai. As I said, obviously we've seen the insurgency is continuing in North [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2431.12s)]
*  Sinai and with the effects of COVID-19, we've seen a complete halt to tourism across the [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2437.7599999999998s)]
*  peninsula, particularly of course in South Sinai. Just give us an update on the status of the Sinai [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2444.08s)]
*  communities and tribes, both in relation to the pandemic and regarding the security situation in [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2450.08s)]
*  the area. Thank you Hafsa. Actually, Sinai people have been living under like between a hammer and [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2456.88s)]
*  anvil for so long and now also they are facing the global pandemic. North Sinai has been under a [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2469.84s)]
*  lockdown for years, way before the pandemic has started. It was also, it was due to the war on [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2477.12s)]
*  terrorism and now it seems ironic but it's time, it might be time to pay off a little hopefully [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2485.68s)]
*  because not of course justifying the deadly measures and normalizing the exceptional rules but [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2493.9199999999996s)]
*  since the first military operation started there like eight years ago in August 2012, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2501.12s)]
*  unlike most parts of Egypt, North Sinai is the last place in all over Egypt that it has announced [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2509.52s)]
*  the COVID-19 cases. With the first positive case, it was late April, 30th April and the first death [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2518.32s)]
*  of the virus, it was in June, this June on the 11th. So far the pandemic has not hit Sinai, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2527.2s)]
*  the whole Sinai, Minnesota, north and south, the way it hit Cairo. Now we are having almost [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2534.8s)]
*  100 cases and this is like according to last week from both north and south Sinai health officials [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2541.52s)]
*  and it seems that the pandemic can be controlled in Sinai, in north Sinai [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2551.84s)]
*  specifically. It can be controlled and we have like a lot of chances to control it more than Cairo [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2558.7200000000003s)]
*  for so many reasons. I think the pandemic spread will rely on two specific points, how the operation [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2566.88s)]
*  of the land crossings with Israel and Gaza on the north and the second point it's about resuming [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2574.6400000000003s)]
*  the tourism to the south Sinai. If extra care and like the necessary tests and precautions are [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2581.2s)]
*  followed, Sinai can survive from the pandemic like no other place in Egypt. Regarding the security [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2588.48s)]
*  situation, it sure has been upgraded lately comparing to the chaotic brevis here since 2013. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2596.24s)]
*  Yes, there has been like a major incident or two incidents every month, I mean terrorist attacks, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2604.48s)]
*  but if we take a deep look we will find that the location of these incidents are no longer inside [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2611.76s)]
*  the cities or the villages and also it's basically like hit and run styles and using the bombing [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2618.08s)]
*  devices rather than the full engagement that we have witnessed in 2013 and 2014 and which has led [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2624.7200000000003s)]
*  to like a deadly this this toll. Based on my research, I think also many of the MIGA and [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2633.12s)]
*  most deadly terrorist attacks, it occurred in July since the removal of Morsi in July 2013 and also [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2641.2s)]
*  way before that. It was in Charm Sheikh, the most deadly attack happened, the most terrorist attack [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2648.72s)]
*  happened in all over Egypt before the Arab Spring. It was on July 23rd which is the anniversary of [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2657.04s)]
*  the army officers taking the regime in 52. So it was the biggest and the deadliest attack. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2664.16s)]
*  It happened in Charm Sheikh in 2005 and after this we have also the first of Jolatel which is like [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2673.76s)]
*  it can be described as like the deadliest battle after Yom Kibur in 1973. This was a [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2681.7599999999998s)]
*  deadliest battle but it was inside not a war with a foreign country, it was with ISIS, with the [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2690.64s)]
*  light Sinai and this happened in the 1st of July 2015. So fingers crossed that July can like pass [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2696.08s)]
*  in Sinai and all over Egypt as much peaceful as it can get and I'm so hopeful about this year. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2704.24s)]
*  It's the pandemic of course but the security challenges in Sinai, it can be defeated this year. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2711.4399999999996s)]
*  Thank you Shidi and just to touch on that, sorry can you hear me? [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2723.7599999999998s)]
*  Yep, thank you and just to build on that you know you've interestingly highlighted that July [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2729.4399999999996s)]
*  seems to be the most, the month of significant activity but in turn the ISIS, Sinai province, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2738.0s)]
*  the ISIS offshoot that is in northern Sinai. What's your assessment of the current potency of the [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2752.48s)]
*  group and the Egyptian military's offensive to root out the militancy there? [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2761.7599999999998s)]
*  All right that's a fantastic question. Thank you Hafsa for asking it. I think North Sinai people, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2770.88s)]
*  main challenge is to basically to live a normal life after the chaotic years. It is important also [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2778.24s)]
*  for like entering audience to get an idea about what has been going in Sinai for all of the years. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2785.2799999999997s)]
*  The whole war on terror in Sinai, Venezuela, it has been going deadly for like almost eight years [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2791.7599999999998s)]
*  but only to specific parts of North Sinai which is like accounts like not more than five percent [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2799.84s)]
*  of the total size of the Sinai peninsula. I do hope that Egypt announce the military victory over [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2807.92s)]
*  Wallachia Sinai before the end of ongoing year and I'm sure it can but the real threat not just from [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2815.84s)]
*  military defeating the Wallachia Sinai. I think the real threat comes from the radicalization [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2824.56s)]
*  process of people who witnessed like human rights violation during all of this war [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2829.44s)]
*  and in the name of the war against terrorism of course. His regime is serious about defusing such [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2835.2s)]
*  bombs and defeating the ideology in the same way it's really seeking to defeat it military. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2841.92s)]
*  I think some of like brave steps it would be so much needed. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2850.64s)]
*  So because we all know during wars a lot of mistakes happens and for sure a lot of mistakes [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2858.48s)]
*  happened during all of these eight years. So acknowledging those mistakes and addressing [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2865.68s)]
*  Sinai people with a different narrative and different discourse including them more in reality [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2871.76s)]
*  not just you know figure of speech. I think acknowledging such mistakes and addressing it [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2879.6s)]
*  is the key challenge for everyone. Sinai people to be able to get back to the normal life without [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2884.7999999999997s)]
*  any fears and also the Egyptian army to be able to defeat without Sinai post-idology and of course [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2893.8399999999997s)]
*  military. I think also one of the main current challenges for the army nowadays is a growing [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2900.88s)]
*  threat coming from the western borders with the Libyan. So even so the army announced it like [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2907.44s)]
*  killing Hisham Ashmehawy who was the terrorist megamind behind many of the deadliest attacks [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2915.68s)]
*  in Egypt but Hisham Ashmehawy's strategy seemed to because he moved to Libya and he got captured [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2922.56s)]
*  in Libya and then Egypt succeeded in transferring him back to Egypt and then they hanged him earlier [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2928.64s)]
*  this year. I think one of the key themes of Hisham Ashmehawy's strategy is to get the Egyptian [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2934.96s)]
*  army distracted within and with Libya and with also the borders with Libya and even so Hisham [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2941.12s)]
*  Ashmehawy is off now he's killed but it seems that it might his strategy it might get working now [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2950.32s)]
*  with the current updates from Libya. I see no big harm of having like the Egyptian army [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2957.76s)]
*  on a standby situation now with the updates on Libyan conflict but I think also as we are [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2965.0400000000004s)]
*  following up the political leadership is seeking a de-escalation for the whole conflict as you [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2973.76s)]
*  mentioned before and as Sharif also mentioned and not risking a wide involvement of the Egyptian [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2979.1200000000003s)]
*  army crossing the border which would have great cost not only to the Egyptian army and the Egyptian [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2986.64s)]
*  troops participating but of course also to it would affect Sinai and it would affect also the [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=2993.2s)]
*  south border as well. Thank you Sharif and on that note moving to the southern border you [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3001.92s)]
*  you've recently released a report with Carnegie on the Egypt Sudan relationship and I [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3013.44s)]
*  thoroughly encourage people to to read it and the effect on the Nubian communities and you've [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3019.7599999999998s)]
*  provided some guidance and recommendations related to both the border crossing itself [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3026.96s)]
*  but also the movement and the long held attempt for the right of return. Just very very briefly if [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3033.8399999999997s)]
*  you could highlight your observations from your research and the main issues with the Egypt Sudan [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3041.68s)]
*  relationship and that border between Egypt and Sudan. Yes sure my pleasure and actually to make [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3047.2799999999997s)]
*  it very briefly even so the popular relations between Egyptian and Sudanese people are based [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3057.3599999999997s)]
*  on mutual respect and peaceful coexistence. I think I try to shed some light on the sources of the [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3063.3599999999997s)]
*  hidden conflict. The hidden conflict that keeps just arising to the surface every now and then [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3070.64s)]
*  when the media for instance focuses on the Halab and Shalatine disputed areas and when it comes [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3078.16s)]
*  also to the GRD, Ethiopian dam and the Nile conflict. The main reasons underlying the conflict [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3085.2s)]
*  based on my research findings are four reasons since Sudan independence in 1956. The first reason [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3091.6s)]
*  is the tightened security over border and restriction of movement of people [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3098.24s)]
*  out of the country from Egypt and inside the country as well and it has accelerated with [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3104.56s)]
*  after 2013 it has accelerated with imposing more visa restriction between the two countries [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3112.3199999999997s)]
*  that goes actually against the four freedom treaties that both countries have signed on 2004. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3119.3599999999997s)]
*  The second reason is the displacement of Egyptian and Sudanese Nubian after building the high [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3126.48s)]
*  dam back at the 1960s where Nubian families after the construction of the dam they got like [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3132.08s)]
*  we we got a huge geographical gap across the border they were leaving and they were feeling [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3140.48s)]
*  more than 300 kilometers of the border and now they are they have moved in Aswan and now they were [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3147.12s)]
*  immigrating to Cairo Alexandria and other European and the US to the US also seeking to work [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3154.4s)]
*  and to afford their families. The third source of the conflict which is the conflict the ongoing [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3162.2400000000002s)]
*  conflict over Halab and Shalatine the disputed triangle and especially after 2013 it has increased [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3168.5600000000004s)]
*  the Egyptian army has increased the military presence there. The first and last reason of all [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3177.2s)]
*  of this conflict is the political antagonist between the two regimes especially since assassination [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3184.64s)]
*  attempts of Hosni Mubarak's ex-president which was commonly believed back then that the Sudanese [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3190.16s)]
*  Omar al-Bashir was behind it. All of these issues have affected it has it have affected not only [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3197.2799999999997s)]
*  Egypt's longest land border it has with Sudan which is 200 kilometers and 76 but also it has [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3204.24s)]
*  affected the local borderland communities and it has affected millions of citizens of both countries [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3216.4799999999996s)]
*  restricting their movement between the two countries. Yet the fall of Mubarak regime it [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3222.64s)]
*  fully gave way to organized activism within the Nubian communities both Egyptian and Sudanese. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3228.08s)]
*  This activism leads to more pressure to the regime and with this pressure it has led to the [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3235.68s)]
*  opening of the first two land crossing between the two countries which they were used to be one [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3240.7999999999997s)]
*  country and but they were only relying on the Nile ferry to cross the borders now they are [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3246.96s)]
*  they have opened to coastal and or keen land crossings both 2014 and 2017 but with the closure [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3253.6s)]
*  also of the crossings those crossing as part of the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown procedures [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3261.2s)]
*  and so on the two countries need to use this opportunity to bluster the mutual interest [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3267.28s)]
*  that they are having because they are post-suffering now from the pandemic the economic pandemic [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3273.92s)]
*  impacts and they will unfortunately suffer from this impacts for at least two years or something [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3281.3599999999997s)]
*  like that. So my my take on this is the return of Nubians to the border areas could really really [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3290.3199999999997s)]
*  help improving the cross across border relations as well at a later stage both Egypt and Sudan can [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3297.2s)]
*  really revive their discussions on like collaboration on some projects like connecting [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3304.56s)]
*  the two countries with railways and electricity and engaging also in opening a third land crossings [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3311.12s)]
*  as you're talking about it for 40 years and finally when it comes to halal and shalatine this is like [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3317.6s)]
*  the main theme of the conflict to known to public I think if it really remains like unresolved like [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3324.4s)]
*  this the potential for more serious conflict between Egypt and Sudan will remain and will appear [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3332.64s)]
*  and of course with this UBS thing I think it might be a bargain between the two countries that they [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3339.04s)]
*  are pushing each other so finally my take on halal and shalatine I think both countries can do [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3343.8399999999997s)]
*  smart maneuver and settle down the conflict with striking some special and unique deal agreement [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3350.4s)]
*  that gives the disputed areas extra service from both countries and both countries they can share [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3357.52s)]
*  the gold and mineral wells and resources that they are going they are extracting from this disputed [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3364.0s)]
*  area by doing this it really really can make like a breakthrough with the relation resolving this [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3370.16s)]
*  historical conflict and of course it can give an amazing example to the whole middle east border [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3376.88s)]
*  conflicts how to have like a win-win strategy and resolving conflict with very very peaceful ways [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3384.4s)]
*  I hope that answers your question thank you it does and and again it's a very very good report [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3393.12s)]
*  um thank you to all three of our speakers um we have a very number of questions and apologies [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3399.84s)]
*  both to the speakers and to the audience that we may jump around as I'm looking to address [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3408.08s)]
*  them all coming in so apologies if we do sort of jump from Libya to Sinai to Aswan to Ethiopia [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3416.48s)]
*  and so forth we're going to go back and loop back to Libya with a question Sharif for you [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3424.3199999999997s)]
*  um a political solution based on the status quo in Libya is surely a recipe for continued [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3434.0s)]
*  political instability the question reads the LNA seems to show no interest in one [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3441.28s)]
*  and reliance on the tribes would be even less stable the question asks isn't it more in Egypt's [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3450.6400000000003s)]
*  interest to accept and work with an even with even an unfriendly gna that controls the border [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3457.2s)]
*  your remarks [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3464.56s)]
*  well I mean that's that's an interesting uh [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3468.48s)]
*  because I think I mean if if let's imagine the scenario whereby the gna controls all of Libya [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3473.6s)]
*  um including the border with Egypt then there would be no point of political solution because [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3482.4s)]
*  that would be the imposed political solution which the LNA maybe tried to to to advance when it [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3487.6s)]
*  when it launched its its triply offensive to sort of unify the country under its leadership [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3495.6s)]
*  obviously it didn't work out and now we're seeing um sort of the the opposite happening [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3501.2s)]
*  um to be honest I'm very I'm very doubtful about the the potential for the gna forces to actually [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3507.84s)]
*  capture Sir Dandruffa and move into the east I think I think I mean yes they've had many [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3518.2400000000002s)]
*  successes in the northwest but now they're risking to be a bit overstretched and the the the LNA [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3524.96s)]
*  forces are still present and they are very committed to prevent the gna from expanding [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3534.4s)]
*  further into central and and eastern yeah and they are backed by by Russia by by Egypt by the UAE [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3542.08s)]
*  um we're seeing a deployment or a presence of Russian fighters from the Wagner group [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3551.12s)]
*  that are according to my understanding are still present in the Droghfa airbase [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3558.08s)]
*  um so I mean I I don't see that scenario as a likely scenario um and I think I mean [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3563.44s)]
*  regarding the appetite for the LNA to negotiate a political solution I think it has more appetite [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3572.0s)]
*  now because it has an interest in uh sort of just securing its gains or its um let's say its current [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3576.8799999999997s)]
*  areas of control and a political solution based on that um um and and not kind of lose any more [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3584.88s)]
*  territory to the gna I think it has more interest in doing that what we're seeing now is um perhaps [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3593.6s)]
*  the gna that kind of just tries to to build on the military momentum to to capture more more [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3600.56s)]
*  territory so it's it's perhaps a gna that is that has less interest now in negotiating based on the [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3607.36s)]
*  current uh state of affairs yeah thank you um we have just about 15 minutes so I'm going to ask [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3614.0s)]
*  our speakers to their response I have one more for Shadi Flashmary before we move on away from [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3622.16s)]
*  Libya um in your opinion what are the dynamics between Egypt and Russia regarding Libya and how [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3630.64s)]
*  much do their interests overlap? [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3636.56s)]
*  Yeah again that's a great question because the Russian role in Libya has been a big enigma I [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3641.44s)]
*  think in in recent years and particularly recent more recently I think there is a great deal of [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3646.56s)]
*  uh of common interests um in Libya and we've seen that in recent weeks in the kind of [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3652.0s)]
*  political statements from both governments um kind of trying to to to foster a political solution [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3659.68s)]
*  based on the current territorial uh control areas um so there is a great deal of overlap of um kind [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3666.32s)]
*  of a common interest in supporting um the L&E and kind of trying to find a political solution and [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3674.96s)]
*  while supporting the eastern authorities however I would like to highlight the fact that the [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3684.88s)]
*  interests of Egypt and Russia in uh in Libya are extremely different and very divergent in in the [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3689.7599999999998s)]
*  sense that um Russia views Libya as more of an opportunity to project its influence uh in in an [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3697.44s)]
*  important country like Libya but also across North Africa to uh to have a presence south of Europe and [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3705.7599999999998s)]
*  to um to be present or to have an influence in in a country where Turkey is present and [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3713.2000000000003s)]
*  that could give Russia leverage in any negotiations between Turkey and Russia [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3720.88s)]
*  over Syria for example but also for economic benefits down the road while for Egypt it's [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3726.7200000000003s)]
*  it's a it's a direct national security issue and just given given the the massive border between [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3732.4s)]
*  the two the two countries it's a that it Egypt sees the current dynamics in Libya as more of a [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3740.4s)]
*  threat than an opportunity I think even with the with the threat to intervene in Libya I don't [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3748.0s)]
*  think it's interested in sort of having long-term economic gains in Libya I mean the economic gains [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3754.0s)]
*  would would would be something but it's not the priority of Egypt but also it has no interest in [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3760.56s)]
*  occupying eastern Libya let's say it's its key priority is security and that's I think that's [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3765.84s)]
*  that's probably the the benefit or the the advantage that Russia has because it has more [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3774.2400000000002s)]
*  leeway in dealing with Libya as it doesn't suffer any consequences from instability there [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3779.28s)]
*  Hopsa I want to add a very small point I'm coming sure I want you to also answer within your [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3786.2400000000002s)]
*  response briefly we're getting a lot of questions on this idea that the or this possibility that [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3793.92s)]
*  the recent statements on Libya are some kind of way to divert attention from the gurdon from the [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3802.56s)]
*  the Ethiopia question and the idea of no resolution on the dam how do you think the dispute on the [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3811.28s)]
*  Nile if it has any way to influence on calculations with an intervention in Libya [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3818.8s)]
*  you know does one side imply you know does one policy of action on one side imply action on [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3825.76s)]
*  another one well I think yes I think Egypt can't afford to have basically two wars and this conflict [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3833.1200000000003s)]
*  in Sinai at the same time like historically speaking when Egypt does this they basically [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3846.4s)]
*  no military can afford this like let alone we have like the Egyptian military has been not [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3859.36s)]
*  like tested in wars while the [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3866.56s)]
*  like 40 years since like an actual war since 73 since then there was there has been no like very [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3872.2400000000002s)]
*  like military action so we and there have been like several reports on how efficient the [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3880.2400000000002s)]
*  the military is and and Sinai so we like to have three or to have two open wars at the same time [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3888.0s)]
*  this is a very very dangerous situation that if Egypt choose if the Egyptian government [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3895.2s)]
*  choose to to do so it would be one of the riskiest decisions that a decision maker can take [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3905.7599999999998s)]
*  so I think for now like like from the Egyptian point Egypt still have more time to maneuver and [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3916.3199999999997s)]
*  to give like make more pressure on Ethiopia when it comes to diplomatic and [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3923.76s)]
*  or if the security council come up with a resolution that asks for negotiations to come back [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3931.6000000000004s)]
*  and then they have another step that sent to sanction Ethiopia or to prevent the Ethiopian [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3938.6400000000003s)]
*  goods or Ethiopian ships to cross from this canal so as because if Egypt is in a war with a country [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3944.48s)]
*  like legally they have according to the costantini agreement the Egypt can like stop or [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3950.88s)]
*  prevent ships that comes from countries that Egypt has war with to to use the Swiss canal so there [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3962.88s)]
*  are like some tools that Egypt can use internationally to to pressure Ethiopia and I think the deal is not [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3968.2400000000002s)]
*  very hard to get we have today like a very clear like Sudan put an outline for a deal and they [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3977.12s)]
*  submitted this morning to the security council and it's very clear that countries can come together [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3986.4s)]
*  so yeah thank you Mahmoud my eye is just on the clock so I have a question for [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=3994.96s)]
*  uh Sharif and then a question for all the speakers and I apologize to people who may not [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4003.7599999999998s)]
*  see their questions answered but I understand that you know we've taken up time already from [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4012.48s)]
*  people of days and and greatly appreciate the audience that also worry that we should end on [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4017.6s)]
*  time um Sharif a question that's coming for you is um sorry um is the uh the current decline that [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4024.64s)]
*  you noted of the potency of terrorist groups and militant activity in Sinai how much do you think [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4033.68s)]
*  reflective Egyptian government counter-terrorism measures or is it related to the defeat of ISIS [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4042.24s)]
*  in Syria territorially other factors you can point to well I think uh it is very difficult to [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4049.52s)]
*  give to give like a definite uh answer for this question it's so many reasons has contributed to [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4059.68s)]
*  just giving us such like less tricky and less mess uh compared to the uh the previous years [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4068.48s)]
*  once there was like a high wave of terrorism and political violence so I do think like the strategy [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4080.8s)]
*  by the Egyptian military it's finally worked uh but to go through all the steps there are a lot [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4091.36s)]
*  of things that could have been avoided as well and I do think as well uh uh the factor of the [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4100.08s)]
*  defeat of ISIS it has contributed a little but uh I don't think this is like the major factor [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4108.32s)]
*  of this because we were having uh unsurpassed amounts way before what I tie night and of course [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4117.12s)]
*  uh Hisham Ashma we contributed a lot and then he uh disagreed with uh with the militias and left to [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4123.679999999999s)]
*  Libya but it was also uh uh he was using some strategy to distract the Egyptian army so a lot [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4132.0s)]
*  of reasons and factors but we can't name one factor for it but I think would be all of us [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4140.96s)]
*  will be so glad if we can finally defeat the world at night in this year but yeah do you want to say [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4148.88s)]
*  something thank you no no sorry sorry I let you finish no no so so just to finish this uh I think [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4157.52s)]
*  to go and do a lot of research into this because all we all know it's it's like a kind of black box [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4166.88s)]
*  but for example uh it has been only this year at the beginning of this year specifically if I [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4174.64s)]
*  I recall it was the 24th of January the first like uh uh congress members and staff they have [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4181.52s)]
*  been to Arish and I think this uh it's a big and it's a huge step comparing to previous years [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4190.8s)]
*  it was very very difficult to get any access any like external access even from Cairo [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4197.04s)]
*  to have some official visiting Arish and staying and for a day or something like that I think it [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4204.24s)]
*  couldn't happen before before this year so I do hope for this year yeah it's it's a corona and [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4211.2s)]
*  stuff but I do hope for this year the war against terrorism in Egypt will be like it will succeed a [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4217.36s)]
*  little thank you uh Sharif so the closing question uh for all of you and uh I'm going to give you a [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4223.5199999999995s)]
*  minute each to respond um is uh dealing with the pandemic and the global economic recession and [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4234.639999999999s)]
*  sort of the massive effects that are very much out of Egypt's control um at the moment how does [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4244.8s)]
*  it affect the Egyptian government's ability to deal with Libya and or Ethiopia and or Sinai and [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4252.08s)]
*  how so um if we start with Sharif Moheddin then Mahmoud and then end with Sharif Lashmewi [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4260.96s)]
*  uh I think Egypt's uh the last couple of weeks since uh since it started to take like serious [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4267.4400000000005s)]
*  measures with the corona in on in March I think we have acquired so far uh about 13 billion dollars [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4275.76s)]
*  uh assistance foreign assistance to deal with the corona stuff so I think it would be more than [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4285.280000000001s)]
*  be more than enough to continue like with all of this assistance till the end of the year [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4291.84s)]
*  but if if God forbid the corona virus like uh stayed with us for another year I think it will [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4298.72s)]
*  be uh uh it would be hectic and it would be consuming uh a lot with economic dealing with [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4305.200000000001s)]
*  economic impacts but it's not quite it's not so much related in my my opinion because the decision [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4311.360000000001s)]
*  to go into Libya or to go with Ethiopia or to go with any other conflict it's not basically [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4319.12s)]
*  economically to Egypt because if if the regime really want to go they will go well no matter what [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4325.5199999999995s)]
*  so I think the current strategy is working to being defensive to alerting the army like this [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4332.4s)]
*  like Cece mentioned a couple of days ago and visited like the troops on the western borders [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4338.48s)]
*  I think to be defensive that's that's very good but if we engage in some like wide wars or uh [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4344.96s)]
*  whatever battles uh crossing the border with Libya or whatever I think it would be consuming [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4351.84s)]
*  a lot and it will like affect the economy of the country so much [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4357.12s)]
*  thank you please thank you I would say like uh uh the pandemic and the economic [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4366.96s)]
*  effect of the pandemic uh uh affected uh uh Egypt uh ability to deal with uh affected Egypt ability [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4374.8s)]
*  to deal with this with the Ethiopian conflict and uh it will affect the how the Egyptian [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4384.400000000001s)]
*  regime can deal with the conflict in the future and now we're having a health problem that it's [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4392.320000000001s)]
*  really Egypt is the numbers of infection have been has been been increasing for this month [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4398.16s)]
*  this month alone the numbers increased for 200 and almost 50 percent [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4406.48s)]
*  so you have this problem which is a health problem which which affected significantly [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4413.04s)]
*  the economic problem uh the economic situation in the country so adding to this if the country [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4420.0s)]
*  take an action either military action which or or goes into this way of like militarizing the [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4427.839999999999s)]
*  problem this will make it extremely heavy uh on uh the Egyptian economy uh while dealing with all [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4435.36s)]
*  of this um if not if they didn't take an action this will also have uh if they didn't give it a [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4444.08s)]
*  serious attention and they didn't come with an agreement as much as as possible [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4452.88s)]
*  or as fast as possible uh this will a water crisis will add uh uh to the current two major [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4458.08s)]
*  problems uh which is economic and uh health problems that Egypt is facing at the moment [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4466.72s)]
*  so I think the pandemic and the economic uh implication has affected Egypt quite significantly [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4473.4400000000005s)]
*  to deal with it with the renaissance problem thank you uh Mahmoud uh Sharif you'll get the [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4479.2s)]
*  last 30 seconds so go for it thank you Hafsa I mean I mean as as you described it I think there [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4488.16s)]
*  is a convergence of challenges that Egypt is facing uh mega challenges and um but at the same [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4496.0s)]
*  time we we sometimes tend to forget that um these kind of challenges have always been present [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4502.8s)]
*  and um especially Egypt's environment has always been uh kind of unstable and we've we've always [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4508.96s)]
*  faced um uh challenges on our borders so I think I think today we're perhaps in a better position [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4515.76s)]
*  than uh before because um uh there is a decent state capacity to deal with some of these challenges [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4524.8s)]
*  um I think the political stability is definitely uh um uh in a better position than uh perhaps [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4533.92s)]
*  a few years back and uh I think dealing with these these challenges will usually depend on [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4541.4400000000005s)]
*  the state's capacity and ability to call the responses and sort of give the enough resources [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4549.04s)]
*  to each of these challenges uh to deal with them and um yeah I mean it will it will it will [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4556.24s)]
*  to a great extent it will depend on the the government's ability to just coordinate the [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4565.44s)]
*  responses and uh yeah to be able to to deal with them in a in an efficient way [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4571.04s)]
*  Thank you very much uh Sharif uh Sharif and Mahmoud for an incredibly interesting discussion and with [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZgMXEzgemU&t=4577.04s)]
