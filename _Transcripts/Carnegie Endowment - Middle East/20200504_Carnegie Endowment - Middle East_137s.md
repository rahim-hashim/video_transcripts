Video Description: Prime Minister Netanyahu and rival Benny Gantz struck a power-sharing deal with Netanyahu set to be prime minister for the first 18 months. Will he attempt to annex Palestinian settlements on the West Bank? President Trump's Israeli-Palestinian peace plan has seemed to suggest that the United States would support annexation, but how will the 2020 U.S. presidential election play into Netanyahu's decision?  To annex or not to annex? That is the question that Aaron David Miller will try to answer.

# Netanyahu's Decision: To Annex or Not to Annex
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [May 04, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMM-kD49IY)
*  To annex or not to annex? That's the question. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMM-kD49IY&t=0.0s)]
*  According to the coalition agreement that Netanyahu signed with Ben against, it's really not an issue of [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMM-kD49IY&t=3.84s)]
*  can he? It makes it very clear that as of July 1, once coordinated with the Americans, the prime minister can introduce [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMM-kD49IY&t=9.48s)]
*  legislation for cabinet approval, even Knesset approval, for the application of sovereignty to parts of West Bank, even the Jordan Valley. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMM-kD49IY&t=17.2s)]
*  The question is will he? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMM-kD49IY&t=24.16s)]
*  On the go side, I think the arguments are pretty strong. It's a legacy issue. He can foreclose the possibility of a two-state solution. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMM-kD49IY&t=26.16s)]
*  Netanyahu had no intention of becoming the midwife of a Palestinian state. He can leave the legacy of [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMM-kD49IY&t=34.12s)]
*  application of sovereignty over the large settlement blocks, even the Jordan Valley. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMM-kD49IY&t=40.04s)]
*  He has a Knesset majority to do it. Most of the Israeli public believing Israel will never return these areas anyway [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMM-kD49IY&t=43.16s)]
*  will be quite supportive. And the Trump administration, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMM-kD49IY&t=49.56s)]
*  inherent in its peace plan, has made it pretty unmistakably clear that they favor the move, although they've sent mixed signals of late. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMM-kD49IY&t=52.48s)]
*  On the no side, the arguments are also pretty compelling. You've got international reaction. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMM-kD49IY&t=59.56s)]
*  You've got the Jordanian reaction, the Arab state reaction. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMM-kD49IY&t=64.92s)]
*  You've got a Trump administration that has sent very mixed signals, and it's not entirely clear [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMM-kD49IY&t=69.0s)]
*  whether they're prepared to give a green light. The Israeli security establishment has yet to weigh in. And with Benny Gantz as the Minister of Defense, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMM-kD49IY&t=73.88s)]
*  he's certainly going to want to highlight the consequences and complications of [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMM-kD49IY&t=81.36s)]
*  annexation. Bottom line, Netanyahu was a risk-averse politician and very reactive. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMM-kD49IY&t=87.32s)]
*  He's talked about annexation for a long time, but he's never done it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMM-kD49IY&t=92.8s)]
*  And the real question is, if prompted, if given any reason, and that reason will be a green light from an American president who, if he believes [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMM-kD49IY&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  his election is, re-election is close, and that this arguably might help, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMM-kD49IY&t=105.28s)]
*  he'll send a green light. And combined with Joe Biden's yellow light, the fact that he's not going to strenuously [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMM-kD49IY&t=110.96s)]
*  oppose this, Netanyahu may well, by September, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMM-kD49IY&t=117.44s)]
*  decide to apply sovereignty, most likely to large Israeli settlement blocks on the West Bank, dealing yet another [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMM-kD49IY&t=121.52s)]
*  blow to a two-state solution [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMM-kD49IY&t=129.28s)]
*  that is already almost permanently closed for the season. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMM-kD49IY&t=132.24s)]
