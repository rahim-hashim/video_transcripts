Video Description: Corruption in Tunisia is perceived to be even more pervasive today than under former president Zine el Abidine ben Ali, despite numerous legal measures and civil society initiatives working to fight it. Can Tunisia’s government and civil society win this fight?

# Tunisia’s Corruption Contagion
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [October 25, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8)
*  Okay, I think we're ready to start. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=0.0s)]
*  My name is Marwan Maasher. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3.92s)]
*  I'm the vice president at Carnegie in charge of the Middle East program here. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5.2s)]
*  I want to thank everyone for coming. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=10.34s)]
*  We're excited today to launch a new report, Tunisia's Corruption Contagion, a paper that [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=13.76s)]
*  describes a very important issue that occupies the minds of all Tunisians, civil society, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=20.56s)]
*  and parliament, and describes the process in detail. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=28.88s)]
*  The paper argues that corruption has become, in a way, democratized in Tunisia. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=35.72s)]
*  It is no longer in the hands of few people, but is now becoming a widespread phenomenon [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=42.72s)]
*  across the country, and argues that for the democratic transition to survive, the Tunisian [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=51.72s)]
*  government and civil society, with targeted support from the international community, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=58.32s)]
*  must fight a two-front war to both address the former kleptocracy and the emergence of [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=63.32s)]
*  widespread petty corruption in the country since the revolution. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=70.44s)]
*  We are pleased to be able to discuss this important issue with a great group of speakers [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=76.12s)]
*  and all of you today. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=81.72s)]
*  This is the first paper or report from a new Tunisia program that we have called Tunisia [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=84.44s)]
*  Monitor Project, a project which attempts to track the status of Tunisia's transition [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=95.92s)]
*  in the economic, political, and security spheres. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=102.64s)]
*  It provides original analysis and policy recommendations from a network of Tunisian contributors and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=106.58s)]
*  Carnegie experts to inform decision makers in Tunisia, Europe, and the United States. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=113.24s)]
*  All of the project's materials, including analysis, as well as resources and suggested [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=121.72s)]
*  reads, can be found on the newly established Tunisia Monitor website at Carnegie, Carnegie [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=126.96s)]
*  Endowment.org, special projects, Tunisia Monitor. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=134.24s)]
*  This event is being live streamed, by the way, and we encourage you to tweet about it [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=141.44s)]
*  using the hashtag TunisiaCEIP. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=146.4s)]
*  Before we have a discussion about the paper and Tunisia's issue of corruption, we're [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=152.8s)]
*  very honored today to be joined by Tunisia's member of parliament and leader of the Afak [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=162.28s)]
*  Tunis party, Mr. Yassin Brahim, who will provide opening remarks. Mr. Brahim, I think, is well [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=169.56s)]
*  known to most of you. He is the former Minister of Development, Investment, and International [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=176.56s)]
*  Cooperation and previously served as the Minister of Transport and Equipment. Mr. Brahim, the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=183.64s)]
*  floor is yours. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=191.04s)]
*  Thank you, Marwena. I'm not anymore, in fact, member of parliament. I've been two months. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=194.04s)]
*  As soon as I've been appointed as a minister, I've been replaced by Mrs. Reem Mahjoob in [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=204.64s)]
*  the parliament. So I'm really very happy always to be here. And actually, last time, I've [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=208.92s)]
*  been here in April 2016 when you launched the study on Tunisia and we worked a lot together. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=217.23999999999998s)]
*  I was minister at the time of the investment and the strategic planning, economics planning, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  and we worked a lot together. And I'm happy that this is followed by new studies and having [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  this monetary initiative in Carnegie. So it's really a pleasure. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=235.08s)]
*  I wanted today maybe to give you an overview where we do stand, my point of view in Tunisia, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=238.56s)]
*  of course. Before being in government, my last visit as a politician was in June 2014. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=246.56s)]
*  And at that time, I was with Maryam Bourguiba. Bourguiba is my granddaughter. We were a bit [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=256.44s)]
*  surprised by the enthusiasm. It was positive about Tunisia. We were just getting out from [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=264.24s)]
*  the national dialogue. We had the constitution and we are going to organize the first free [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=271.16s)]
*  election, second ones after 2011, but I mean first elections after the constitution. And [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  we had to moderate that enthusiasm based on the fact that we were explaining to the people [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=283.4s)]
*  that we met, it's fragile. It's fragile, especially on the social and economic challenges, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=289.48s)]
*  of course, security challenges that we were facing at the time with all what's happening [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=297.12s)]
*  in the region and what happened also in the country after the three years of the power [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=301.72s)]
*  that we had at that time after 2011. And also the political map was really under creation, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=309.72s)]
*  new creation of political map, of course, in the country. So the enthusiasm was too [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=317.44s)]
*  much for the real situation in Tunisia. And unfortunately, we were not wrong because we [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=323.88s)]
*  faced it. We faced it as a member of government, the social and economic, we start with that, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=331.03999999999996s)]
*  problems that we had. So we had to make the diagnosis, we had to build a vision, a strategy [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=338.23999999999995s)]
*  and an action plan based on five access that you will find in the government. You also [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=342.64s)]
*  report about the governance, Tunisia being a hub for the regions, for the economy, all [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=347.88s)]
*  the social needs, especially education investment that are needed, the healthcare investment [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=354.56s)]
*  that are needed in the country, all the disparities that we have between the regions within Tunisia. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=359.08s)]
*  And that's one of the main issues that we had. And also how we could start because it's [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=365.88s)]
*  a country without so much natural resources, especially the problem of the water, the problem [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=370.4s)]
*  of the clean energy, et cetera. So we worked on that and we started the reform plan, especially [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=375.0s)]
*  with the help of the international institution, the IMF, we were under the program of the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=381.56s)]
*  IMF, we're still under the program of the IMF, the World Bank, the African Development [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=386.04s)]
*  Bank, et cetera. We made a lot of reforms, a lot of new laws, banking system reform, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=390.12s)]
*  central bank new law, the antitrust law, the investment code, et cetera. And we were able [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=397.24s)]
*  to do that. But after all these reforms and this, let's say the speed of reforms, and [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=405.6s)]
*  I organized as a minister in June 2016 with the World Bank, a kind of a present and diagnosis [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=411.04s)]
*  of what we have done, we didn't see any benchmark with the country having done so much in terms [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=418.04s)]
*  of rules. But at the end, those are papers. How, at which speed we are really now changing [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=425.2s)]
*  things and impacting people on their day to day life. Any reform, take time, take years. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=435.44s)]
*  And our problem today in Tunisia, and it's still the problem, is really a lack of good [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=441.48s)]
*  delivery. It's a question of execution. And one of the reforms that I proposed actually [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=448.88s)]
*  that we have a strong resistance from the unions is how we will reform the administration, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=457.96s)]
*  how we will move Tunisia from a social bureaucracy that we have for years, and that's a model [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=463.56s)]
*  in fact, to more a country that is believing in the free market and having social justice, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=469.16s)]
*  but with good delivery of the projects all over the country, especially going to more [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=476.64s)]
*  PPP projects and more ambitious way of delivering in terms of governance and transparency. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=482.2s)]
*  And that area, I consider today that we are really late and we are not doing very well. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=490.2s)]
*  And it's one of the issues when you make a follow up and you see, for example, in my [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=499.0s)]
*  government with Hbib Asid as a governor-chief, I'm discussing with him, we took in 18 months [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=503.64s)]
*  5000 important decisions in the minister council, etc. Just 880 have been executed in one year. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=510.68s)]
*  That means that we have really a problem of delivery and execution in the country. And [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=520.2s)]
*  that's why I suggested also to have a kind of, and we have the same problem in France, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=525.6400000000001s)]
*  we are too close to France, in Morocco as well, to create a kind of top level executives [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=530.1600000000001s)]
*  in the administration level. Maybe it will represent 1% of the administration, but people [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=537.6400000000001s)]
*  that could have a status that is more close to the private sector status, we can bring [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=542.88s)]
*  new blood and we can bring also the best from the administration going to that status, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=547.92s)]
*  well paid, because they are not well paid today, the leaders, especially, to transform [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=552.36s)]
*  the country we talk about 2019. The second challenge is security. As you know, in 2015 [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=557.4399999999999s)]
*  we had a very, very challenging year. I mean, we started in February, in March we had a [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=565.36s)]
*  Mardou attack, in June we had a Souz attack, in November we had a Mohammed 5 Avenue attack, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=572.36s)]
*  and in fact it was a kind of combination of heritage of how the country was managed before, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=579.48s)]
*  of course, set the date, but also what's happening in Libya especially. The chaotic situation [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=585.44s)]
*  in Libya is impacting a lot in Tunisia. All the jihadists, even if they are Tunisian, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=591.32s)]
*  were trained in Libya, the border is 300 km, was open, so we made a lot with the help, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=595.88s)]
*  of course, of our friends from the G7 countries, especially the West and Germany. Now we have [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=601.92s)]
*  a border that is more protected, we enhanced a lot also our security capabilities internally [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=608.16s)]
*  with the help of our partners, and also we spent a lot on security forces. I'm analysing [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=613.88s)]
*  now in my party, we are analysing the 2018 budget when we see what happened in the four [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=622.04s)]
*  or five last years, and we take even an average of expenses of Tunisia in all departments, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=628.6s)]
*  we see the security, whatever if it is internal or military, it was twice or three times the [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=634.6s)]
*  average of the expenses that we had all over all the departments, and especially we haven't [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=641.6s)]
*  invested enough in education, healthcare, etc., and the arbitrage went to security. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=647.2800000000001s)]
*  Without security you don't have any discussion about the economy or social issues, so that's [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=652.96s)]
*  why we did it. And actually, to be honest, maybe that's the main positive outcome that [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=657.12s)]
*  we have today after two years, we are having in 2017 some European tourists coming back [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=664.3199999999999s)]
*  to Tunisia, we didn't have any terrorist attack in the two last years, even if you are impacted [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=670.7199999999999s)]
*  with the attacks that we had in Paris or Brussels or Germany or whatever, of course the tourism [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=678.7199999999999s)]
*  is impacted in Tunisia, but within the country we made a lot of improvement in terms of security, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=683.24s)]
*  that's the most positive, but we need to continue to follow and invest, and certainly the tourism [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=690.24s)]
*  has a large impact in our economy, directly or non-directly, it's around 15% of the GDP, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=697.0s)]
*  Tunisia has a history, Tunisia has a lot, it's a destination, a natural destination [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=704.0s)]
*  for so many people, especially in Europe, and Algeria as well, we had two million Algerians [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=708.48s)]
*  this year coming to Tunisia, so our security is also dependent on what would happen and [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=712.92s)]
*  how we solve also the issue in Libya and the chaotic situation that we are living in. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=719.2s)]
*  The third topic concerns politics. So, I won't say it's a nightmare, classical in politics, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=724.2s)]
*  but as you know we had the opportunity in 2014 to have a kind of alternance, in fact, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=737.5200000000001s)]
*  the Islamists won in 2011, in 2014 the secular won, but we haven't won sufficiently to manage [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=747.5200000000001s)]
*  a lot of the country, in fact, without a clear majority in the parliament, so we started a kind [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=755.2s)]
*  of association, it's not a coalition, but association with the Islamists, they were [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=762.44s)]
*  represented by one minister in the government, but by the time the first party, especially [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=766.8000000000001s)]
*  in Edetounis, started to a little bit have a lot of, has a lot of problems, separated, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=772.12s)]
*  now there are four or five parties that are coming from that party, and the first group [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=779.12s)]
*  in the parliament now became again the Islamist group, so the Islamists have, and the last [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=785.0400000000001s)]
*  government have a weight that is bigger, and we are talking always, and especially the [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=790.36s)]
*  leaders of this party talking about the consensus that we are living in Tunisia is maybe that [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=798.4s)]
*  would make Tunisia specific and make it a success. Actually, it's not so much a success, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=806.0s)]
*  people are unhappy with what's happening in the country, it's a kind of coalition that [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=813.48s)]
*  is counter natural, in fact, today, and there are a lot of concerns about that coalition, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=818.68s)]
*  and the people that voted for the secular party are not happy about the fact that, and [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=824.88s)]
*  people even in the Islamist party are not happy about this coalition, and today there [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=829.8s)]
*  is another problem that is starting to become a real issue, and that's the topic of the [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=837.0s)]
*  conference today is corruption, and what happened in, as you know, the history of Tunisia, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=844.24s)]
*  Tunisia was a kind of a kleptocracy in Ben Ali area, Ben Ali was buying everyone to keep [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=853.08s)]
*  it, to keep it simple, but after the revolution, the corruption become a kind of democratic, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=859.08s)]
*  we have it everywhere, and the problem is that it started to touch the political parties, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=866.96s)]
*  I mean the people that are in businesses that are not clear, et cetera, are financing the [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=874.48s)]
*  political party, and you are even seeing them now coming to the local election that will [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=879.8s)]
*  maybe happen in the following month, and that's bad, so when we saw you share the current [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=885.24s)]
*  government, I mean attacking this very large chapter of corruption in May of this year, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=892.56s)]
*  we were really happy as Tunisians before even being politicians that finally we are taking [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=899.76s)]
*  care of this large problem, and this problem cannot be handled just by the government, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=905.76s)]
*  the justice has to lead the process, and as you know when you have a dictatorship, the [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=910.76s)]
*  dictatorship will use the justice, which means the justice is not completely clean today, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=917.76s)]
*  considered clean at least by the population today, the security forces, the security forces, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=922.76s)]
*  today the security forces of course have to be clean, and also the political system, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=927.76s)]
*  the problem is that the people that were arrested in May, several of them were financing either [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=933.04s)]
*  another or need a Tunisian, and for the moment we haven't seen any political decisions within [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=940.12s)]
*  those parties about that, and that's a problem, that's a big problem, and people are, the [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=946.8s)]
*  consequence of that is that people are now considering that politicians are not delivering, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=953.8s)]
*  economically and socially speaking, and they are maybe corrupted, so this is very bad, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=958.4799999999999s)]
*  so that's why we have, we are in a turnaround where responsibilities are, I mean spread [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=966.52s)]
*  out politicians, but also the government, the justice of course, and what we are now [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=975.4799999999999s)]
*  in effect to understand my party, the main message that we are talking about, yes of [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=982.5600000000001s)]
*  course you can have doubts about politicians, ability to deliver, corruption, etc., but [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=988.52s)]
*  don't put all the politicians in the same basket in fact, so the problem could be about [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=994.44s)]
*  such party or such party, but we need to build the future in a different way, and we have [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1001.16s)]
*  opportunities, and I will finish maybe with that at the end, I want just to talk because [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1005.88s)]
*  I read of course, I mean the pre-report, about the question of the past, and the link also [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1013.0s)]
*  to corruption of the past, I mean we, in effect we were, the past is not the unique problem [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1022.64s)]
*  of course about corruption, what was happening in the past, we consider that we've been late [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1029.6399999999999s)]
*  to start the transition of justice in Tunisia, we had to start it with the work on the constitution [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1037.0400000000002s)]
*  very quickly, because most quickly you started, better it is in terms of result to get all [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1044.68s)]
*  the steps, working how the system was working, not just people, how the system was working, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1050.1200000000001s)]
*  to ask people and to see if some of them has to go to the justice system of course, what [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1055.68s)]
*  will be the, how we will let's say pay for the people that were victims of the system [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1061.08s)]
*  of course, how we will then make the reconciliation and finish by changing the laws that were [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1067.36s)]
*  affecting the system, that's the transition of justice process, and fortunately we consider [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1073.6s)]
*  and we were in opposition at the time, that the people in power at that time tried to [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1079.3999999999999s)]
*  use the issue of the past politically speaking, I mean to press, to avoid that those people [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1083.92s)]
*  some of those people that were working and making politics in the past come back to the [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1090.72s)]
*  politician, to the politics fight for 2014, they even the businessmen of course were pressed [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1096.12s)]
*  and pressed by the political parties in charge to buy their, I would say their freedom actually, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1105.36s)]
*  so it was used at a certain stage and we were pressed to say let go to the transition of [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1113.36s)]
*  justice as quick as possible to avoid that in fact, so it's been done by the end of 2013, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1120.56s)]
*  few weeks before the Troika leaves the power and it's been started since then and we considered [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1128.04s)]
*  globally that it's been a bit oriented, it's a political, the political, the political [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1136.04s)]
*  I would say power at that time was really this law was not adopted as I saw in the report [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1141.72s)]
*  as a consensus, it was more driven and led by the political power that was in place at [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1147.48s)]
*  that time, so some work has been done, good work as transition of justice process but [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1152.52s)]
*  not at the right speed, so the president came with the reconciliation law and the beginning [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1157.2s)]
*  it was supposed to be with the people that were working in the administration or ministers, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1163.3400000000001s)]
*  responsible etc and also businessmen mainly and at a certain stage, since the beginning [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1170.38s)]
*  we were not positive with that law, especially with the second chapter, we considered that [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1177.46s)]
*  we haven't fought in Tunisia enough corruption, we didn't have any cases of corruption, especially [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1183.54s)]
*  with the business connected to the system that we go so quickly for reconciliation [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1191.54s)]
*  law, it was in 2015 I guess on that side, about the administration our position has [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1200.54s)]
*  been always different because in the administration case we were talking about the people that [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1206.54s)]
*  didn't become rich because they applied some instruction from Ben Ali or Ben Ali area, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1214.26s)]
*  these people will be qualified in the transitional justice or in the normal justice but we are [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1223.02s)]
*  talking about people, I was minister of transport, the CEO of Tunisia that were at place after [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1228.7s)]
*  the revolution in 2012 or 2013 made one year in jail because with two or three other CEO [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1234.1s)]
*  because Tunisia their flight company was hiring people from the family of Ben Ali on [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1241.1s)]
*  the instruction of the system, so this kind of decision that were not of course normal [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1250.8999999999999s)]
*  in the law etc were daily decision in the system globally, another one the minister [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1259.8999999999999s)]
*  that unfortunately we lost him a few weeks ago, not the same but he's been also for something [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1267.9s)]
*  similar in fact accused for six years in jail, so I mean there was when I was minister in [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1278.3000000000002s)]
*  2015 I had around 10 or 15 directors that had injustice problems because in fact they [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1286.14s)]
*  executed instruction coming from the palais or coming from ministers etc etc, so the idea [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1293.3400000000001s)]
*  was to say if we have any people from the administration that executed orders coming [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1299.3400000000001s)]
*  from the system without having personal benefits we need to make a reconciliation with those [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1306.18s)]
*  people because it's not fair at the end and it's used politically even because justice [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1313.18s)]
*  is not completely now independent etc in Tunisia, so that's why we pushed and we went as a [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1320.46s)]
*  fertoons of course to the president to Capage and we asked that this reconciliation law [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1327.78s)]
*  has to cancel the chapter about the business and we keep it just for the administration [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1333.0600000000002s)]
*  and that what was adopted at the end in the parliament, so we will talk about it more [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1337.9s)]
*  in details of course not everyone will agree on this statement. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1344.0600000000002s)]
*  To finish we are at a kind of turnaround that is very important, we need to vote to [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1347.58s)]
*  become what you saw maybe in some Latin American country or even less violent places like Sicily [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1358.06s)]
*  is today in politics and the mafia link, so we need really to find corruption at the right [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1368.1s)]
*  one, the people that would use politicians for their own targets and we have it already [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1375.54s)]
*  in Tunisia and we need to fight it and to stop it, so otherwise people won't believe [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1383.54s)]
*  on the fact that really democracy is a good system, with an autocracy we had corruption [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1390.8999999999999s)]
*  and even with democracy with money with people that are not clean we can handle and manage [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1395.74s)]
*  politicians, so this is a turnaround that is very important especially for the local [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1402.22s)]
*  election and for 2019. We need also to accelerate this transitional [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1406.3799999999999s)]
*  justice process and to finish it with a clean approach, with a transparent approach without [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1414.46s)]
*  political calculations, we feel that we have it today. We need on the economic side to [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1420.46s)]
*  start to look to the future with more ambition and especially looking to the 2019 on how [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1428.46s)]
*  we will deliver and not what we will do because in Tunisia we know what we must do to transform [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1434.98s)]
*  this country, how we will do it and at which speed we will do it, that's the challenge [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1441.38s)]
*  for the future period. We need a free market regulated by committed, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1446.38s)]
*  honest political leaders at all levels, that's exactly what we need in Tunisia and we are [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1453.5400000000002s)]
*  working on it, we will start with local election and we hope that in 2019 it will be really [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1460.5400000000002s)]

*  covered North Africa. And I will start with you Sarah, maybe to talk and focus on the [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1627.28s)]
*  paper itself. We all mentioned the idea of democratization of corruption in Tunisia. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1634.8799999999999s)]
*  What do we exactly mean by that and how do we address this problem? The government has [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1642.24s)]
*  taken several laws and mechanisms to fight corruption and yet these have not been very [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1650.24s)]
*  effective so far. So what do you think Tunisia should do to address this problem? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1659.2s)]
*  Sure, well thank you everyone for joining us for this. I'm very excited that we are [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1666.2s)]
*  launching this paper today. This idea, I'm glad to hear that this term democratization [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1670.0s)]
*  of corruption is taking off. I think it's a very accurate term to describe what we [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1674.72s)]
*  found in researching this paper which is that first of all the level, the perception of [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1679.16s)]
*  the level of corruption between Ben Ali's time and today has increased in Tunisia. In [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1684.4s)]
*  our own survey that we conducted for this report we found that 76% of Tunisians believe [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1689.68s)]
*  there's more corruption in Tunisia today than under Ben Ali. Now whether or not that actual [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1696.24s)]
*  number, there's actually more in dollar amounts, we don't know. But the point is that people [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1701.08s)]
*  feel there's more corruption today and why is that? One of the reasons is that it has [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1707.04s)]
*  become democratized meaning that most anyone today in Tunisia can benefit from corruption. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1712.04s)]
*  So in the Ben Ali era you had a kleptocracy, you had the idea that you had widespread corruption, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1717.04s)]
*  petty corruption but also grand corruption but it was controlled. There was this mafia-like [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1722.76s)]
*  system that very much kept track of who was benefiting from corruption and made sure it [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1727.56s)]
*  was the family of Ben Ali and his wife. Today that's not the case. That most of the institutions, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1732.76s)]
*  most of this mafia-like structure is gone. However, people are still carrying out the [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1739.12s)]
*  same petty corruption, people are still benefiting from bribery for example, from nepotism and [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1744.9199999999998s)]
*  at the same time corruption because you had a revolution because there's freedom of speech, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1751.48s)]
*  people can talk about corruption. You also have the democratization of discussion of corruption [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1757.2s)]
*  meaning that I think people feel it more simply because they're talking about it more. So part [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1762.24s)]
*  of the report was to dive into this and figure out why do people believe there is more corruption. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1767.52s)]
*  And as Marwan mentioned, there's been a lot of government initiatives, you can read about them [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1771.52s)]
*  in detail. There's a lovely timeline in the paper that has all the different initiatives. You can see [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1776.12s)]
*  how much the government and civil society have both done to tackle this problem. But I think [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1780.36s)]
*  the main concern that we found is that Tunisia is fighting a two-front battle, which has already [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1786.1599999999999s)]
*  been discussed a little bit. This idea that you have the Ben Ali regime and you have corruption [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1791.76s)]
*  that's sprung up since the revolution and trying to figure out how to fight those two things at [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1795.6799999999998s)]
*  the same time is crucial. And what we found is that government is mostly addressing the corruption [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1800.32s)]
*  that's sprung up since the revolution. Civil society is very interested in the past and reconciling [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1805.1999999999998s)]
*  with the Ben Ali regime and making sure the transitional justice process keeps moving forward. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1810.56s)]
*  So one of our main overarching recommendations is that both of these need to be addressed [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1815.2s)]
*  simultaneously and civil society and government need to talk to each other. And this is something [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1820.0s)]
*  where both are fighting and doing incredible impressive things, but they're at odds with each [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1824.56s)]
*  other. So hopefully we'll get into that a little bit more in our discussion today. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1829.44s)]
*  Thank you, Sarah. Well, talking about civil society, that's a perfect segue to Seymah. Seymah, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1833.2s)]
*  what is your view of how the government is handling corruption? And do you think that the next [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1839.44s)]
*  municipal elections will have any positive impact on corruption? Well, first of all, thank you so [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1844.16s)]
*  much for inviting me. It's a pleasure to take part. I'm not going to talk about what I think [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1851.6000000000001s)]
*  that the government is doing. I'm just going to give facts. I know that this government, when it [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1856.88s)]
*  was given the confidence of the parliament, it was very committed to fighting corruption. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1865.1200000000001s)]
*  One of the promises was to pass certain laws, two of which were passed, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1872.56s)]
*  including the protection of the sweet lowers and the law that governs the constitutional authority [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1879.76s)]
*  that takes care of good governance and fighting corruption, which if I may mention the numbers, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1886.24s)]
*  none of the Fertunas is numbers of corruption. This is why I want to really talk about numbers. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1892.96s)]
*  Um, however, there are other laws that were supposed to pass, which is the conflict of [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1899.68s)]
*  interest law, the declaration of asset and the illicit, um, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1906.0s)]
*  has yet to pass. It was passed to parliament, but absolutely no participatory approach in drafting [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1914.48s)]
*  this, this bill. Here I'm stating facts because you mentioned Sarah that there's, there seems to [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1921.52s)]
*  be a divide between civil society or the general public and decisions. Uh, there were some, uh, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1926.16s)]
*  good or some advances from the government, which is increasing some of the, um, some of the funding [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1933.68s)]
*  for the anti-corruption, uh, instance or authority. However, we do know that in the 2018 financial [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1939.28s)]
*  act, there is absolutely no money that is assigned to this authority. So we do have a government that [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1947.68s)]
*  is very committed to fighting corruption. There any government official speaking, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1953.68s)]
*  they do seem to be aligned with what everyone feels. However, factually there's nothing that's [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1960.5600000000002s)]
*  on paper. Another example is, um, this idea or this obsession with fighting corruption [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1966.16s)]
*  that is not coupled with an obsession with a rule of law. I have a government that's very committed [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1973.3600000000001s)]
*  to putting people behind jail, not committed to preventing corruption, for example, reform of the [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1979.76s)]
*  justice system. And here I'm going to give a figure. In Tunisia, we have a very French judicial [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1987.12s)]
*  have the administrative court in a way it's the, uh, it's the justice, um, institution that guarantees [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=1992.8799999999999s)]
*  the rights of citizens, uh, station of the state or the rights of the state in relation to the [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2001.12s)]
*  different public institutions. No money was taken into account in order to reform the administrative [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2006.4s)]
*  court. Um, no money was, uh, was assigned to the, to the financial poll or any [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2012.16s)]
*  financial, uh, crimes. So these are all numbers that are proposed by the government approved by [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2024.0800000000002s)]
*  the parliament. How's the majority of the coalition or the ruling? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2030.0s)]
*  These are questions that we need to ask. How are words translated into action? Um, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2036.64s)]
*  I need to talk about the reconciliation law. It's something that wish we did not need to speak about [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2043.6s)]
*  in post-revolutionary Tunisia. Fortunately, it's a topic that takes the energy and the time and the [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2049.52s)]
*  emotion of so many people on both sides. The, uh, record the, uh, administrative reconciliation law [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2055.92s)]
*  as discussed as introduced by, uh, him is a law that brought up lots of controversy. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2062.7200000000003s)]
*  And it's not only because it was proposed by the president of the republic. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2070.56s)]
*  Curricature is everyone is against this law because, you know, everyone in society wants to [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2075.12s)]
*  act like the opposition and anything proposed by the ruling party or the president is something [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2079.76s)]
*  that people are automatically opposed to. But this is unfair. Question of fairness of judgment [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2085.6s)]
*  was brought up. It's unfair because it does not admit that there's a change in the concepts and [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2091.92s)]
*  the understanding of concepts of justice, corruption and transitional justice. And this is a commentary [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2096.96s)]
*  that I have about the report. It's not a question of corruption pre the revolution and corruption [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2103.7599999999998s)]
*  that's after the revolution. It's are we willing to admit that we do not deal with the past? Are [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2108.88s)]
*  we able to build something that is solid in the future? We cannot just pretend. And I think this [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2114.08s)]
*  is I don't speak in the name of civil society, but I think this was what was expressed by Alba [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2119.7599999999998s)]
*  Sala and by different civil society organizations. Can we really say that we'll start from scratch [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2124.88s)]
*  post revolution? We will forget everything that happened and start building for a non corrupt [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2131.44s)]
*  state bearing in mind that previous figures from free revolution are also appearing in the decision [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2138.24s)]
*  making. That is a different story. Are we willing to admit that it is impossible to deal with the [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2146.56s)]
*  future and the present without dealing with the past? And I think that is a key question that needs [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2153.2s)]
*  to be dealt with because the way we approach it with corruption is going to be the same way we [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2157.6s)]
*  approach it with education and health and the justice system. So it seems like what we see [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2161.52s)]
*  through facts is that there seems to be a change in concepts before the 2014 elections and after [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2168.08s)]
*  the 2014 elections. I'll stop here. I'm sure we're going to have more questions. Thank you very much, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2175.84s)]
*  Shayma. Before I go on, let me first acknowledge the presence of Ambassador Faisal Kouay with us. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2182.8s)]
*  He's a very good friend and a regular guest at Carnegie's events. We're always happy to see you [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2189.2799999999997s)]
*  here. So with all the problems that Tunisia faces today, and as you all hear, there are many of them. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2195.3599999999997s)]
*  Still a lot of people in the Arab world and beyond feel that Tunisia has been [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2207.7599999999998s)]
*  an anomaly, as Sofwan mentions, in the Arab world. They have done things that no other Arab country [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2212.56s)]
*  has done, whether it is in the agreement on a new social contract among all components of Tunisian [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2222.16s)]
*  society, whether in the exercise of peaceful transfer of power between the Islamists and [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2233.92s)]
*  secularists, or whether it is in such issues as women's rights where women today enjoy by far [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2241.6s)]
*  better legal rights than any other Arab country. Sofwan, when you talk about an anomaly, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2251.04s)]
*  I'm very interested to understand what exactly do you mean by an anomaly. Does that mean that this [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2260.24s)]
*  is something that is an exception that will not be repeated anywhere in the Arab world, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2267.44s)]
*  or does that mean that it is an exception that needs to be duplicated, and can it be duplicated? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2273.28s)]
*  And if you can just shed some light on this. Sure. So thank you, first of all. Thank you, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2280.88s)]
*  Marwan, for including me, and thank you all for being here this afternoon. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2286.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, yes, Tunisia has been a largely successful experience. As Yassine has said, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2290.4s)]
*  it's fragile. It's a democracy that's quite fragile, and that's under a lot of stress, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2299.6800000000003s)]
*  especially on the economic slash corruption front, but also on the security front and in terms of [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2304.7200000000003s)]
*  achieving political stability and consolidating the gains of the revolution. This is something [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2312.64s)]
*  that will take time, and it's an on-line process. But looking at where Tunisia is today and the [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2317.92s)]
*  path that it has been on, the fact that it is an anomaly by the sheer factor that it's the only [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2325.84s)]
*  success story to have emerged out of the Arab Spring makes it anomalous. What we're witnessing [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2333.6s)]
*  here today makes it an anomaly. The fact that you have active civil society at the level that is [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2341.04s)]
*  represented by you, Shaima, and by your organization and other organizations that you're familiar with, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2350.4s)]
*  the fact that you have here representatives of the government in the form of the ambassador, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2357.44s)]
*  and you have the leader of a new political party, and we're able to have this kind of very frank [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2363.44s)]
*  and transparent conversation and not be subjected to any reasons to sort of hold back in any of that, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2369.52s)]
*  I find that anomalous in the Arab world that I am familiar with. The conclusion in my book, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2380.0s)]
*  which really is driven by a quest to understand what is it so special about Tunisia that has [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2390.32s)]
*  allowed it to be on the path that it has been on since the revolution started there. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2397.28s)]
*  And you've mentioned some of those examples, Marwan, the peaceful transitions, the Troika coalition, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2404.88s)]
*  the culture of debate and consensus building that was personified in the national dialogue in 2013, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2411.6800000000003s)]
*  the fact that today we have a democratically elected president, that we have a parliament [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2418.4s)]
*  that is functioning, that we have all of these things. My first question was, how come? What gives? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2426.08s)]
*  Why is Tunisia able to do this and other Arab countries have not been able to? And then secondly, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2433.7599999999998s)]
*  can it serve as a model for the rest of the Arab world? On the first one, the two of course are [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2440.24s)]
*  very much interrelated. There are distinguishing factors about Tunisia that are very difficult [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2448.88s)]
*  and some of them are impossible to replicate. And I would put them into two categories. One is [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2456.08s)]
*  luck factors, environmental factors. Tunisia has benefited greatly from its geographic location, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2462.2400000000002s)]
*  from the fact that it has had boundaries that have been shifted over the centuries. The only other [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2469.44s)]
*  Arab country that one can say that about is Egypt, really. That it has been a homogeneous [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2474.64s)]
*  society, 98% Sunni Muslims, so absent this sectarian warfare. It has not suffered from [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2482.08s)]
*  the resource burden of other countries and it was unimportant to the rest of the world. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2489.92s)]
*  And that has really happened. It did not get entangled in the Cold War intrigue. It did not [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2496.3199999999997s)]
*  get entangled in the Arab intrigue. And its detachment physically also from the center of [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2501.84s)]
*  gravity of Arab politics, the poisonous Arab politics of the second half of the 20th century, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2509.2000000000003s)]
*  all of these things helped Tunisia. But I think at least equally importantly is that in Tunisia [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2517.2000000000003s)]
*  there has been a very long history of reform. And that's what I focus on in the book, is trying [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2524.64s)]
*  to explain and understand this culture of reformism that really has been going on for a very long time. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2533.2s)]
*  And so in my book I really focus on the middle of the 19th century and Harakat al-Islah, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2543.44s)]
*  how Tunisia benefited from the leadership that it had, both political leadership as a semi-autonomous [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2550.16s)]
*  province of the Ottoman Empire, how it benefited from the intellectual and economic trade that it [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2557.2s)]
*  had with Europe during the 19th century, and how it benefited also from intellectual reformers [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2563.68s)]
*  during that time who interacted a lot with the Renaissance movement, al-Nahda, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2570.24s)]
*  that was taking place in Cairo and Beirut and Damascus, but that was far more expansive than [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2577.52s)]
*  that reform movement. The Tunisian reform movement dealt with human rights, you know, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2585.36s)]
*  in the abolishment of slavery in 1846, 19 years before we did in this country. It had constitutional [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2591.36s)]
*  dimensions associated with it, and it had educational components associated with it. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2598.16s)]
*  And much of that reform also came from within al-Zaytuna mosque. So reform had dimensionality [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2604.24s)]
*  associated with it that dealt with the reform of Islam and the reform of the role of religion in [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2611.44s)]
*  society, the advancement of women's rights, which people in the late 19th century wrote about, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2620.16s)]
*  you know, from Abdulaziz Talbi and others like him, to the reform that came out of Zaytuna in [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2627.04s)]
*  the form of Tahir Haddad's treaties on the advancement of the rights of women, [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2633.84s)]
*  the labor union movement also, which was an outgrowth of that intellectual reform movement. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2641.44s)]
*  So my argument is that by the time Tunisia became independent in 1956, Habib Bargheba, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2646.4s)]
*  who was a visionary, no question about it, had the road and the path already paved for him. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2651.76s)]
*  He rode on the shoulders of reformers who had come before him, and he implemented significant [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2658.56s)]
*  reforms, particularly in the areas of women, women's rights, education, and the role of [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2664.32s)]
*  religion in society. And when he combined those factors with the civil society activism that was [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2671.7599999999998s)]
*  an outgrowth of the labor union movement, you sort of start to understand why Tunisia has been on the [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2678.08s)]
*  path that it has been on and why the things that we have witnessed over the past few years and [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2684.48s)]
*  continue to witness are there, which then leads me, and I'll finish with this, the conclusion [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2689.52s)]
*  that it cannot serve as a model for the rest of the Arab world. It is an anomaly, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2698.56s)]
*  because those ingredients, some of them are very specific to Tunisia, cannot be replicated fine, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2702.88s)]
*  but those that can be replicated have been growing and have been evolving over a very long [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2708.24s)]
*  period of time. What I do hope, though, is that to the extent that there's an anomaly, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2714.72s)]
*  that it can serve as a source of inspiration for the rest of the Arab world. There are very [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2720.16s)]
*  valuable lessons to be learned about the Tunisian experience by Arab populations and Arab nations [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2725.3599999999997s)]
*  more broadly, so that perhaps some of those experiences that we see in Tunisia can be [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2735.92s)]
*  replicated elsewhere, but that it would take a very long time. But I also think that many of [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2742.88s)]
*  those valuable lessons are also important for Tunisians themselves. I think Tunisia needs to be [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2747.6800000000003s)]
*  cognizant of its history along those paths to try to avoid some of the mistakes that have been [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2754.1600000000003s)]
*  done in the past. So to link it back to the report, let's not forget that what drove the [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2761.3599999999997s)]
*  revolution in Tunisia was the poor economic state and corruption. Corruption not only in the form of [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2767.6s)]
*  kleptocracy, but corruption in terms of how economic data was manipulated, corruption in terms of how [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2774.56s)]
*  we in the West actually were ineffective in terms of the role that we played [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2783.04s)]
*  in monitoring and in ensuring that Tunisia was on the right economic path. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2791.84s)]
*  Thank you, Sufan, for this very thoughtful analysis of what has been going on. I want to go back to [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2798.32s)]
*  and discuss the current government's emphasis on corruption. The government has made it its [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2807.2799999999997s)]
*  banner, if you want, Logan. And how do you assess that world on corruption? Is it succeeding? [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2815.12s)]
*  Is the new government better able to address it than the old one, or are we still in the same? [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2824.64s)]
*  If I may enlarge the scope of the question to not just the executive branch, but also the [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2831.6s)]
*  legislative, I think there is a pressure to deliver results. A pressure that is put [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2839.2s)]
*  on all decision makers, whether parliamentarians, government officials, [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2848.64s)]
*  the president, the justice system. That is a pressure that requires immediate actions. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2853.04s)]
*  But since we're still in transition, I know everyone wants us to stop being in transition, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2860.4s)]
*  but that does not stop by stopping using the word. We need to get past the transition. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2866.32s)]
*  And that requires establishing institutions. So I cannot talk about the war on corruption [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2872.64s)]
*  without speaking about the establishment of other institutions, such as the Constitutional Court, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2880.08s)]
*  such as the election of municipal councils and regional councils. Those might seem like they're [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2885.44s)]
*  not related to fighting corruption, but they are. Because the first step in fighting corruption is [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2890.6400000000003s)]
*  to create this accountability environment, where if someone witnesses corruption, they can denounce [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2896.4s)]
*  it and actually speak against it. Which takes me to an issue that I'm really passionate about, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2904.5600000000004s)]
*  which is decentralization. And it pains me that we couple it with corruption and we say [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2910.08s)]
*  decentralizing corruption. I think what is happening is geographically it's becoming more [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2914.56s)]
*  present. But I think the solution for corruption is decentralization. Because the closer you bring [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2920.24s)]
*  decision making to people, the closer those who are responsible for corruption are to people. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2925.84s)]
*  And the more possibilities for people to hold them accountable. I'll give an example for [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2931.68s)]
*  municipalities. If decisions are really made on a municipal level when it comes to [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2936.24s)]
*  public projects, people know who is actually doing a good job and who isn't. They know if that road [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2945.4399999999996s)]
*  is going to break in two weeks' reigns or if it's going to actually hold for 10 years as it's [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2953.3599999999997s)]
*  supposed to do. And this increases the chance that people actually fight the phenomena of [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2960.88s)]
*  corruption. Again, it pains me that the government, the parliament, and the presidency are not really [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2967.84s)]
*  committed to establishing this. We keep on delaying the date of municipal elections. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2975.12s)]
*  No real commitment to put in place a legal framework that's related to decentralization. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2982.1600000000003s)]
*  There's a whole law that needs to be passed. The election of the constitutional court members is [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2989.76s)]
*  delayed. So how can you be committed to fighting corruption in existing institutions if we're not [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=2996.5600000000004s)]
*  giving enough attention to non-existing ones that are supposed to create the balance, that are [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3002.0800000000004s)]
*  supposed to drive the reform of the justice system and every other institution? I think the term [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3007.76s)]
*  fighting corruption in itself has to improve. It's exactly like fighting unemployment. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3013.36s)]
*  We'll fight unemployment forever. We're never going to fight it, but we can improve the economy [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3019.84s)]
*  to generate employment. This might seem like a play on words, but no. It actually changes the [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3023.6800000000003s)]
*  whole approach to the problem. In fighting corruption, it seems like civil society at [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3029.92s)]
*  least is put in an equation that is very difficult. It's like fighting terrorism but giving up human [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3038.5600000000004s)]
*  rights. Now it's like fighting corruption but giving up the right for just trial. This is [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3044.24s)]
*  something that we have noticed with arresting the figures, the extremely corrupt figures, or [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3050.3199999999997s)]
*  supposedly, I have no evidence. Earlier this year, criticism came from civil society where [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3057.2799999999997s)]
*  if someone is under arrest, they're supposed to have the right to contact a lawyer, for example. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3065.3599999999997s)]
*  They weren't. They were denied for at least a month. Military courts, we started hearing something [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3071.68s)]
*  this talk about military courts suddenly came to the surface and everyone was extremely alarmed, [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3077.9199999999996s)]
*  but then it's like, well, you want us to fight corruption, right? So we should not face such [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3082.7999999999997s)]
*  questions in post-revolutionary Tunisia. The only question is, do we think the government is doing [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3087.52s)]
*  a good job? I think it's doing a good job in bringing discussion about corruption to the table, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3092.48s)]
*  so in a democratic manner. I think it can do a better job in bringing civil society organizations [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3098.24s)]
*  into the discussion and become more participatory in the discussion of bills that are proposed, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3104.0s)]
*  in assessing the efforts. I think assessment is extremely important. It can do a much better job [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3110.3999999999996s)]
*  in allowing real autonomy to the authorities, like fighting the anti-corruption authority. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3116.16s)]
*  There's a discussion, a very interesting discussion on a philosophical level that is taking place in [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3121.8399999999997s)]
*  Tunisia, which is what is the role of different authorities? How do we maintain the power of the [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3126.0s)]
*  state without threatening it by creating independent authorities, like the ones that are fighting [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3131.68s)]
*  corruption at the moment and in the future to be the constitutional one? All these discussions are [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3136.72s)]
*  taking place and they will determine the future of the country. It's doing a good job in bringing [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3141.92s)]
*  those discussions to the surface, but it can do a much better job in taking into account the history [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3147.44s)]
*  of the country and the future by involving all actors. That's how diplomatic it gets. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3152.16s)]
*  You're extremely diplomatic for a civil society activist. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3161.2799999999997s)]
*  Sara, Minister Ibrahim talked about the lack of good delivery and he talked about administrative [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3168.72s)]
*  reform, which not many people pay attention to, not just in Tunisia, but all over the Arab world. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3174.4s)]
*  In many countries, we've created bloated bureaucracies that are inefficient and that [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3185.6800000000003s)]
*  are either unwilling or unable to affect economic reform and affect policies. I'd like you to comment [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3191.76s)]
*  on that as well as what recommendations would you have for the international community? [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3200.32s)]
*  In what ways can it help? I think that this actually ties into what Shai was just talking about, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3206.8s)]
*  which is trying to bring government to the people. One of the things that we found in this paper and [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3213.2000000000003s)]
*  I found in previous research is this massive gap in trust between people and government in Tunisia. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3218.56s)]
*  It's growing and I think that the latest polling on people who intend to vote in the municipal [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3223.6000000000004s)]
*  elections is incredibly low. The numbers are low of people who say they're going to vote should [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3228.56s)]
*  these elections happen. I think this reflects this problem, which is part of it is the service [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3233.04s)]
*  delivery idea that people aren't actually getting anything from their government so they don't [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3237.2s)]
*  understand what the government is there for. This goes also to tax collection issues. People [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3241.2799999999997s)]
*  aren't paying taxes because they don't understand what the taxes are going for. One of the things [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3245.2s)]
*  I think is really important is that the international community plays a role in funding some of these [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3249.7599999999998s)]
*  mechanisms to help increase efficiencies in government, to help increase service delivery. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3255.6s)]
*  One way is through digitization of government services and I think a way to start this would [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3260.3199999999997s)]
*  be at the local level to take advantage of municipal elections to start a couple of [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3265.36s)]
*  municipalities and maybe expand from there on actually bringing government services directly [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3269.52s)]
*  to the people. When we were at Marwan and I were in Tunis in September, I remember I was showing [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3274.4s)]
*  some people this app that we have in Washington. I'm a DC resident and it's the DC11 app, which is [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3278.7999999999997s)]
*  I can go on, if my trash doesn't get picked up, I click a button and I say, [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3284.88s)]
*  trash didn't get picked up and someone, they might not show up, but at least I have a way [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3288.08s)]
*  to connect with my government. This is something that I think actually could be very effective [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3291.68s)]
*  and if you could start it at a couple of municipalities and expand it. But this also deals [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3295.52s)]
*  with the idea of corruption and bribery and if you can take away the person, if you connect people [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3300.72s)]
*  directly to the service, then you remove the incentive, you remove that pathway to bribery. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3306.64s)]
*  Other things the international community can do and I think one thing is just to keep up the funding, [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3312.56s)]
*  particularly for the anti-corruption authority. This idea, I mean we heard over and over again [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3317.6s)]
*  in our meetings in Tunis that the authority is lacking in financial resources and community [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3322.0s)]
*  resources. So the international community can help fill that gap in funding. But also one thing is [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3328.56s)]
*  to integrate anti-corruption mechanisms into current funding, into security assistance and [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3334.72s)]
*  into economic assistance. That means not necessarily supporting anti-corruption as [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3339.68s)]
*  anti-corruption, but supporting as part of all the other international programs that exist already. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3344.56s)]
*  And then finally, I think strengthening civil society and we've seen the good work that civil [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3350.24s)]
*  society does. One way is to continue to help spread civil society to the local level, so to help [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3354.72s)]
*  groups that are fighting corruption, to help them operate at the local level, to reach outside of [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3360.7999999999997s)]
*  Tunis. And then also to help with sort of a public education campaign, I think. So we've talked a [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3366.56s)]
*  little bit about the legal framework that exists and there are some with the lower law, for example. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3370.64s)]
*  It's a great law, it's there on paper, but most people don't know how to access that. So some sort, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3375.68s)]
*  I think the US and other donors can help civil society create education campaigns so that people [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3380.3199999999997s)]
*  understand, Tunisians understand how to access those laws, how to access the justice system [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3386.08s)]
*  once the constitutional court's in place. How do people know how to actually go there, how to report [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3390.16s)]
*  corruption cases, things like that, that you know it doesn't just happen overnight, these things [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3394.4s)]
*  become effective. Thank you, Sarah. And Safwan, I cannot help but ask you this question. You have [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3398.0s)]
*  quite a bit of experience working on education throughout the Arab world. What role, if any, [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3407.04s)]
*  you think can education play in combating corruption? Oh, I think it can play a very, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3413.2000000000003s)]
*  very big role. I mean, to pick up on some of the things that Sarah and Shayma have said, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3418.2400000000002s)]
*  you know, the semantics are important and it's important that we know what we mean when we say [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3424.48s)]
*  we're fighting corruption or we're fighting terrorism. It's important to know sort of, you know, [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3433.6s)]
*  what underlies all of that. We talked about public education, Sarah, I think that that is really very, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3439.36s)]
*  very important. The problems, as I saw them, you know, over the first decade of the century, [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3448.4s)]
*  you know, the last 10 years of Ben Ali's rule, the kleptocracy, the corruption, but also the [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3457.12s)]
*  unemployment and the economic conditions that were deteriorating very, very quickly [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3467.28s)]
*  and especially amongst university graduates. And what had happened also under Ben Ali in terms of [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3474.3999999999996s)]
*  the deterioration of the state of education. So even though I dedicate good space in my book [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3482.3199999999997s)]
*  talking about the wonderful advances in education that Tunisia post-independence was able to [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3488.72s)]
*  implement and how different those were from the education systems of the rest of the Arab world. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3495.7599999999998s)]
*  And just to highlight a couple of things, the bilingualism, the focus on quality, [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3502.8799999999997s)]
*  which also meant that French teachers were retained while Tunisian teachers were trained. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3509.68s)]
*  The fact that university education was not adopted immediately but gradually. The limitation of the [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3514.8799999999997s)]
*  role of religion in the curricula, co-education also played a big role and had something to do [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3520.56s)]
*  also with the advancement of the status of women. You know, all of those things were very, very [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3528.96s)]
*  positive factors. Perhaps the most important factor from an economic perspective is the fact [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3533.52s)]
*  that vocational training was very much a respected area of education in Tunisia until the early 1990s. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3541.36s)]
*  Only 50 percent of primary school graduates in Tunisia qualified for entrance into the [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3552.4s)]
*  VCE system, into the high school system or the middle school and then the VCE system. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3558.6400000000003s)]
*  So, you know, sort of advanced secondary education and certainly university education was reserved [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3564.0800000000004s)]
*  for people who really qualified for that. Whereas the other half pursued vocational training that [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3573.28s)]
*  was of very high quality and that resulted in employability afterwards. You look at great [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3582.4s)]
*  economic models in this world that we live in today, you look at the case of Germany, [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3589.6s)]
*  only one-third of Germans have university degrees. It does not mean that the rest are not educated. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3594.48s)]
*  They're very well educated because they had a good basic education in school and then they were [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3600.56s)]
*  educated in terms of skills acquisition which made them marketable and able to enter the [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3606.4s)]
*  marketplace. Under Ben Ali, and again I'll go back to the role of the international institutions [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3612.1600000000003s)]
*  and to build off what Sarah has said, we need to be far more clever about how we judge things in a [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3618.0s)]
*  place like Tunisia. I mean, I think one of the things that we really messed up in the case of [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3626.2400000000002s)]
*  Tunisia is that we accepted statistics that were coming from the Ben Ali regime that were [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3632.48s)]
*  manipulated, that hid inequalities. You know, we looked at averages, so on average GDP growth was [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3638.16s)]
*  healthy in Tunisia, but it was at least twice as strong in Tunis and the coastal area than it was [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3646.08s)]
*  in the middle of the country. Average poverty rates, average unemployment rates looked like [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3653.28s)]
*  they were in sync with other similar developing countries, but in reality they were twice as bad [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3658.64s)]
*  in the interior regions which actually gave birth to the revolution at the end. Similarly, [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3666.56s)]
*  in the case of education, we imposed the IMF, the World Bank, and other donor organizations. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3673.44s)]
*  We imposed structural adjustments on Tunisia in the feet of education that pushed the Ben Ali regime [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3678.7999999999997s)]
*  to open up the floodgates to schools and to universities so that enrollment figures improved. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3687.36s)]
*  We focused on enrollment figures, we focused on the metrics at the expense of quality. So what [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3697.6s)]
*  happened during that time? First of all, it was the introduction of what's called the 25% rule. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3703.04s)]
*  25% rule was a disaster. 25% rule meant that your graduation score from high school took into account [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3710.0s)]
*  75% of your lice exam at the end of high school and 25% of your grade was made up from three [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3721.6800000000003s)]
*  other exams that you took during the last year of high school that were easier. Okay, so it sort of [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3732.08s)]
*  lowered the bar. More and more people were then qualified to enter university. Vocational schools [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3739.28s)]
*  were eliminated. They were only reintroduced in 2010. It's much more difficult for me to be [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3747.92s)]
*  convinced to acquire skills in a vocational school when I'm 19, 20 years old and when all my friends [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3758.88s)]
*  have gone on to university than when I was 13 or 14 years old and I did not pass the entrance exam [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3765.2s)]
*  to middle school and high school and I acquired a skill otherwise. There were other things that had [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3771.2s)]
*  been not, the exam to graduate from primary school was eliminated. Okay, so as a result, [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3778.72s)]
*  I mean just to give you a couple of numbers between the year 1990 and the year 2010, [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3785.9199999999996s)]
*  school enrollment grew sevenfold. Now remember this is in a country where again [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3792.7999999999997s)]
*  anomalous to the rest of the Arab world fertility rates had been maintained at around two [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3800.88s)]
*  because Tunisia after all eliminated polygamy. Today it's the only Arab Muslim country where [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3808.24s)]
*  polygamy is outlawed and that's been the case since 1956. In 1961 Tunisian women had access to birth [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3814.3199999999997s)]
*  control. In 1973 they got legal access to abortion the same year as Roe versus Wade, [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3820.72s)]
*  the same year as Roe versus Wade in this country. So this is a country that had not been over the [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3827.9199999999996s)]
*  past 20 years growing in terms of its population yet school enrollment went up by seven orders of [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3832.56s)]
*  magnitude and the universities between 1987 and 2001 in the university enrollment went up fourfold, [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3839.9199999999996s)]
*  so what you have today are graduates of universities and of high schools not with the [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3851.2s)]
*  same quality of education that their predecessors, their parents had with them, but nonetheless they [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3858.08s)]
*  hold degrees and they are unemployed. So I think you know part of the, one of the things that we [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3864.0s)]
*  need to pay attention to and one of the things that needs to be reformed in Tunisia is the [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3869.9199999999996s)]
*  education system, the refocus on vocational training, the insurance that we are not, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3876.32s)]
*  that there's no inflation in terms of diplomas and in terms of [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3884.6400000000003s)]
*  university education. I think currently there is inflation which adds to the frustrations you know [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3892.6400000000003s)]
*  when you have university degrees and I've talked to many Tunisian youth who had multiple university [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3897.44s)]
*  degrees but were unemployed, that then I think is something that clearly needs to be attended to [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3904.08s)]
*  and is something that has contributed significantly to the corruption problem indirectly through [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3912.48s)]
*  the unmet economic demand but also directly. 70 percent of Tunisian school students receive some [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3922.7999999999997s)]
*  form of tutoring. 54 percent of those are offered tutoring by their own school teachers, [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3931.04s)]
*  so you have corruption within the education system itself. Actually the 25 percent rule was introduced [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3938.88s)]
*  as a result or it was a corrupt practice to enable certain people to be able to enter university [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3946.24s)]
*  when they would not have been qualified to do so. The 25 percent rule has now been eliminated over [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3954.88s)]
*  the past few years, one of the accomplishments of the former Minister of Education in Tunisia. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3959.6s)]
*  To sum it up, I think when we talk about the economic conditions, when we talk about [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3966.4s)]
*  unemployment, when we talk about border security and the informal economy in Tunisia, we've got to [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3972.24s)]
*  look at education both in terms of what's being taught, how much inflation is there perhaps in [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3980.24s)]
*  the acquisition of university degrees and how we deal with all of this. The good news is the content [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3991.04s)]
*  of what students learn in Tunisia continues to be far superior to what students are taught elsewhere [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=3998.72s)]
*  in the Arab world. All right, enough of me monopolizing this conversation, so [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4007.2799999999997s)]
*  let's take three questions at a time. I want to ask you to keep it short, to address it to the person [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4015.2s)]
*  you want to answer and to try to attach a question mark to the intervention. Yes, yes, it's coming. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4022.7999999999997s)]
*  So much to say and I have to keep this very, very brief. So for Safwan, my main question is [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4036.64s)]
*  you attribute Tunisia's anomaly, there is an anomaly in Tunisia, although I would argue [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4046.48s)]
*  there's some anomalous things and a lot of non-anomalous things, but you attribute it to [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4052.08s)]
*  luck and to culture and what you exclude from that argument is agency. To give you many, [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4056.96s)]
*  many I could think of just two, the way in which secular and Islamists negotiated in the 2000s [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4063.44s)]
*  and the whole October 18th movement and another one is what led to the Nobel Prize, the Quartet. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4069.04s)]
*  So how do you build agency into your model particularly as you're looking to inspire the [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4074.2400000000002s)]
*  neighboring countries? For Shama, the whole issue of youth in Tunisia, if the Tunisian government [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4078.6400000000003s)]
*  right now did everything you're calling for, I still think most Tunisian youth would be miserable. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4091.36s)]
*  And so I'm wondering if you could just broaden 13% of Tunisian young people in one poll said they'd [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4098.4800000000005s)]
*  vote in the next election. So I was wondering if you could think about beyond just the topic today, [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4104.24s)]
*  what revolutionary dividends, big moves the government could make to capture the imagination [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4110.88s)]
*  of young people. And for Sarah, there's a lot of creative new thinking on addressing corruption [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4117.599999999999s)]
*  where instead of just passing laws and jailing people, you disincentivize corruption. The classic [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4126.64s)]
*  example they always give is if people are paying a government official to get a paper quicker, [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4134.24s)]
*  put in an expedition service where it's a legal expediting fee, you can pay more and then ever, [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4138.5599999999995s)]
*  another one would be disincentivizing businesses to act in a corrupt manner through economic [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4145.68s)]
*  incentives built in. What is your thinking having done this report on clever new ways to deal with [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4150.8s)]
*  disincentivizing corruption? Thank you. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4157.6s)]
*  My name is Samaya. Thank you all for your comments. I have two questions. The first one is about [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4165.68s)]
*  decentralization. So, Shama, do you think there are risks to decentralization, meaning [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4170.639999999999s)]
*  create more opportunities for corruption? So basically if one person takes money, but then [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4175.599999999999s)]
*  the decentralization of money. The second question is for Sarah on political apathy. So how do you [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4180.08s)]
*  see, you know, you've mentioned that voter turnouts for the municipal elections are probably going to [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4186.72s)]
*  be low, but then we're still seeing a lot of social protests on the street. So what, how can [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4192.72s)]
*  we address this challenge of turning this street's opposition to votes? Thank you. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4197.04s)]
*  Thank you very much. My name is Salah Sarhan. I represent the Arab League in Washington. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4210.32s)]
*  Thank you so much for inviting me today. First time I attend an event in Carnegie. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4217.84s)]
*  The issue of corruption in Tunisia is kind of striking to me. It strikes me. Tunisia is a bright [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4222.799999999999s)]
*  and shining example when you compare it to the Arab countries. Really it's the first time I [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4233.28s)]
*  heard today that there's corruption in Tunisia. But tell me, where is the zero country corruption [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4238.4s)]
*  corruption all over the world? Corruption is everywhere. This is not my comments. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4245.76s)]
*  The thing is, I would like to know what is the aim from this discussion today. Are we sending a [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4255.04s)]
*  kind of alert to the Tunisian government or a message that we look, you gain a very good [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4261.120000000001s)]
*  reputation after the spring revolution. If you want to maintain this kind of level, you should [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4268.08s)]
*  do that and that and that. I know the government, Tunisian government, they are progressing well. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4273.52s)]
*  The latest result is equalization between men and women in some issue like legacy or other rights. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4279.200000000001s)]
*  So really I'm surprised today. Thank you very much. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4288.72s)]
*  Okay, one more and then we'll allow them. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4294.400000000001s)]
*  Hi, I'm Amir from Tunisia. I want to ask one question to Shama and one question to Sarah. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4297.28s)]
*  Shama, what are your thoughts about this rhetoric of victimization of the people of the administration [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4306.96s)]
*  that they are poor people that have been forced basically to do whatever the regime wanted them to do [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4312.5599999999995s)]
*  and people tend to forget that they were appointed in these positions to serve the regime and [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4318.24s)]
*  and that even if they were giving benefits to their son and daughters, it will be untraceable [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4324.400000000001s)]
*  legally speaking. My second question is for Sarah. What are your thoughts about this rhetoric of [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4331.68s)]
*  political parties, Afek included, that accuse of civil society of sometimes treason and people being [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4338.64s)]
*  funded by foreign money, serving external agenda and we saw these accusations towards [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4347.92s)]
*  Al-Bausala when they were monitoring the cheating of members of the parliaments inside the parliament [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4355.92s)]
*  and I watch when they were attacking our very corrupt private sector that we don't talk about. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4361.4400000000005s)]
*  Thank you. Shama, you want to start? Sure. I'm going to start with the third question. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4368.4s)]
*  I'm going to start with the third question. I'm surprised the Arab League is surprised. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4373.28s)]
*  I think I'm not. I'm not sure actually. I think I'm not surprised. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4379.28s)]
*  It is extremely suffocating to be framed as the beacon of light in the Arab world. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4387.04s)]
*  Great to say that. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4394.96s)]
*  I mean we're extremely proud of what happened in Tunisia. The revolution was really [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4398.48s)]
*  to many people it was they took it to a very personal level. I mean self-included. Some people [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4402.96s)]
*  did not imagine a future in the country. Now they do. Which is why it's very easy and comforting for [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4409.68s)]
*  decision makers in Tunisia or outside to say you know it's on the right track. Let's stop criticizing. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4416.4s)]
*  It's in comparison to the rest of the Arab world. I mean how can we compare Tunisia to the rest of [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4422.48s)]
*  the Arab world. I hate to say this. It's an anomaly. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4426.64s)]
*  This is why I mean it's we wish that one day we can really say that we want to be like one of the [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4432.400000000001s)]
*  Arab countries. May I interject something on that? It's okay to have some flow going on. Sure. But [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4440.72s)]
*  you know it's amazing. During my research every time I spoke to a Tunisian about education for [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4448.160000000001s)]
*  example and I would say my goodness you know how advanced your education is compared to the rest [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4453.2s)]
*  of the Arab world. I would get you know Yusuf Sharif our mutual friend. He said no you know it's [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4458.8s)]
*  not as good as it used to be. And I said give me an example. He said you know I didn't really [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4464.4s)]
*  understand Rene Descartes until I got to college. I looked at him and I said hundreds of millions [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4469.76s)]
*  of Arabs have graduated never even having heard the name Rene Descartes. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4476.64s)]
*  You know he and all of them tell me our standard of comparison is Spain and England and France. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4482.72s)]
*  Steve Kahl who runs the School of Journalism was in Tunisia during the Kazba protest in 2011 [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4489.360000000001s)]
*  writing for the New Yorker. When he asked protesters what model of democracy do you want [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4495.84s)]
*  to copy he thought Malaysia Indonesia. The examples that he got were all you know western [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4500.4s)]
*  models. So part of the anomaly is that Tunisia is not exclusively Arab. I'm going to be even [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4507.44s)]
*  more arrogant and say we want to set our own standard. It's not even any other country because [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4513.2s)]
*  we understand that it's very different. So not being able to comfortably say this without being [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4517.5199999999995s)]
*  attacked of being a traitor and of tarnishing the country's image abroad not being able to [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4524.72s)]
*  criticize this is a fact this is a reality that Tunisian civil society is going through [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4532.16s)]
*  which is to answer the second or the first question about youth. What I was talking about [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4536.400000000001s)]
*  was not the magic solution for people to feel great. This was the minimum for people to be [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4541.12s)]
*  able to envision a life that is that guarantees their rights where you know that if someone [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4546.320000000001s)]
*  chooses you the justice system is actually going to treat you fairly where you know that if you [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4552.32s)]
*  open a civil society organization which is something that everyone boasts about we need [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4556.48s)]
*  to know that we're always under the risk of changing the regulation to one that actually [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4561.44s)]
*  limits civil society. I mean Tunisia today one that is very proud to have Al-Bausal and I Watch is [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4566.24s)]
*  also a country that is discussing passing a law that limits caps international funding for [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4572.0s)]
*  organizations. The fact I hate to say it I wish I would not say it but I'm asked to say the truth [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4577.44s)]
*  so I will only say that. So for youth I think what youth need is not the government to respond to [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4583.679999999999s)]
*  their to their demands it's for them to have access points to decision making. They need a [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4588.32s)]
*  government that allows them to actually influence decisions not only respond to them. We are not in [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4593.28s)]
*  a very young government even though we have a very young not very young but we have a young [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4599.679999999999s)]
*  prime minister so if we're going to wait for youth to actually take a spot in decision making [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4606.88s)]
*  they wouldn't be young anymore. I think what needs to happen it's a fact what needs to happen is to [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4612.72s)]
*  allow them to dream. I'll give an example we have illegal illegal I don't like to use the word but [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4618.8s)]
*  immigrants who are actually taking to the sea they're risking their lives to flee the country [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4626.08s)]
*  but we have decision makers who are not willing I'm not of course I'm generalizing we have a [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4632.0s)]
*  lot of decision makers who are not willing to to admit that this is a problem. We have decision [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4636.56s)]
*  makers who today pretend that you know the money that you put in order to migrate is enough for you [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4642.72s)]
*  to open a project in Tunisia and create employment. This is a lie. We have decision makers who are not [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4648.160000000001s)]
*  close to the reality on the ground. Again I wish I was not saying this but this is a fact. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4654.160000000001s)]
*  As for decentralization does it have a risk? Yes like any public policy like any political system. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4659.280000000001s)]
*  The only thing that makes me a huge supporter of decentralization is that centralization has failed. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4665.6s)]
*  So the best way to approach this failure is to try something new and all it's always something new is [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4672.08s)]
*  always better than status quo. The second the second reason is when you decentralize you're [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4676.88s)]
*  actually diversifying the risk. So let's say you have corruption you have 350 municipalities. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4681.68s)]
*  If you diversify or if you decentralize decisions you're also limiting the amount of money that is [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4687.52s)]
*  spent. So if there is corruption we're talking about corruption in a smaller amount that is [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4693.2s)]
*  detectable. So once you detect it you can easily if you have the will improve the system in a way [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4699.36s)]
*  that makes it more secure towards corruption. Of course decentralization is not only holding [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4706.16s)]
*  elections it is reinforcing the justice system it's reinforcing the education of people so they [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4710.5599999999995s)]
*  can take part of the decision making. It is having local leaders who are actually willing [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4716.32s)]
*  to make decisions. So decentralization is not only elections. If we have all of those things in place [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4723.5199999999995s)]
*  real autonomy financial and administrative real control that is not limiting then yes [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4728.5599999999995s)]
*  decentralization can be a solution. It's not but anything that is different from the status quo [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4734.48s)]
*  is an opportunity. Victimization of the administration I think you're talking about the [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4739.759999999999s)]
*  reconciliation law. So there's this idea in Tunisia that the 800,000 public servants are [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4744.8s)]
*  feeling threatened and cannot make decisions. For me it's surprising because I have at least [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4753.84s)]
*  encountered 500 between municipalities all 350 and work in ministries and I was very pleasantly [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4760.88s)]
*  surprised that there were people who were transparent loved the country and made decisions [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4768.8s)]
*  that were actually good for the country. What is problematic about the reconciliation law is that [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4774.16s)]
*  it's the reconciliation that is supposed to grant amnesty to those who made decisions that were [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4780.0s)]
*  illegal and corrupt under Ben Ali actually starting from Burgeva from 1956 up to 2011 and saying that [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4785.36s)]
*  they were forced to do it. Now there are two ways to look at this. We can say that those are victims [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4793.6s)]
*  those are people who risked you know losing their jobs if they had said no but those are also people [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4798.56s)]
*  who allowed the system to survive because they did not say no. I know so many people who said no [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4806.8s)]
*  to decisions and yes they were either laid off or they were put in the fridge [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4813.04s)]
*  question that we use but those are the people who allowed something like the revolution to take [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4818.96s)]
*  place. We're facing really two options either we say that we should we should [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4823.84s)]
*  basically give a present to those who allow the system to survive or actually give recognition [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4833.84s)]
*  to those who said no. So the victimization I think is overrated especially that we have yet [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4841.599999999999s)]
*  to find a number today there is no official number provided by the presidency of the republic or the [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4847.04s)]
*  parliament that gives us an idea about how many how many public servants are we talking about [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4854.64s)]
*  who are going to actually make use of this reconciliation. Just for me to to summarize [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4860.4s)]
*  we had a bill that was proposed the only bill proposed by the president of the republic [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4865.84s)]
*  trying to push for two years from 2015 to 2017 that the coalition and the government and in [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4870.32s)]
*  parliament pushed for has yet to provide a clear number or figure about who is going to make use [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4877.12s)]
*  of this. I think this answers your question. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4884.88s)]
*  I think what we can do about this is that the justice system has to take the justice has to [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4887.44s)]
*  take its course this reconciliation gives amnesty but as citizens we are allowed to actually oppose [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4900.879999999999s)]
*  to certain decisions if we have information about the appointment of those people. I don't know what [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4907.04s)]
*  to tell you about this. So on the question of clever ways to do something by corruption. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4916.64s)]
*  So Carnegie were blessed to have one of the world's experts on corruption Sarah Chase who's on [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4927.200000000001s)]
*  health care. So I asked her this give me some examples globally of what are some positive [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4931.6s)]
*  stories of fighting corruption and what she said is I don't have any for you. So but I will say [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4936.64s)]
*  one thing in my research the one really good example positive story was in the Philippines [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4942.48s)]
*  where they automated the custom sector and I think generally I'm sort of a lead myself but I think [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4948.08s)]
*  technology works really well here and that this idea of digitizing processes and automating [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4954.799999999999s)]
*  processes removing people removing the ability to even have that corruption take place in the [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4960.5599999999995s)]
*  first place but I also think it's not necessarily about creative solutions I think in Tunisia's case [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4966.0s)]
*  you have a good legal framework you have things that are there that need to be enforced and we [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4970.72s)]
*  read about this in the paper but the asset declaration language was mentioned and that's [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4975.92s)]
*  just one really simple thing you can do because enforce it make sure like require government [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4979.280000000001s)]
*  officials and parliamentarians to publicly declare their assets every year and update them every year [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4985.92s)]
*  and have that be in an online database successful to the public that builds trust with people and [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4991.84s)]
*  it has the information publicly available it's out there which kind of goes to this political [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=4996.96s)]
*  apathy question as well you know I think service delivery is a big part of this showing people [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5001.68s)]
*  that government is doing something for them you know and connecting people to the government I [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5008.16s)]
*  think again at the local level it's a lot easier to do than it is at the national level so I'm [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5013.44s)]
*  somewhat optimistic that should there eventually be municipal elections that that will help [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5017.68s)]
*  connect people to their government and help deal with that in some cases [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5022.64s)]
*  on the NGO the sort of the pushback against I mean I swear it's very troubling the idea it's [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5027.6s)]
*  not a Tunisia problem where you have government sort of using civil society and NGO laws to [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5036.0s)]
*  of treason or terrorism or whatever but I think I think Tunisia has a leg up in this fight [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5043.92s)]
*  that you have a very open and free media you have people paying attention and I think that that [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5051.84s)]
*  first of all is the first step and the second step is for the international community to pay [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5057.76s)]
*  attention to this and to fight and again it's not a new problem to Tunisia when I was at the [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5061.28s)]
*  state department I dealt with a different country where you have the exact same situation and getting [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5065.68s)]
*  the international community to to pay attention to push back and recognize how essential civil [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5070.32s)]
*  society is between Tunisia I think the there will be people on on the side of civil society [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5075.76s)]
*  so I know we have to be quick so you the gentleman's question you're absolutely correct [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5085.52s)]
*  I mean and I'm sorry if I did not present it properly the cultural and luck factors were sort [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5093.12s)]
*  of background elements that helped but the focus of my argument is on agency and it is on so I [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5099.04s)]
*  encourage you to get the book because it's really about that you know the education women civil [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5108.32s)]
*  society and religion and part of the anomaly also you know I go to great lengths to talk about [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5113.76s)]
*  and not done that when Mahda evolved and how even the political Islam of Tunisia is anomalous from [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5120.8s)]
*  an Arab perspective and not that is not your you know run-of-the-mill political Islamist party [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5128.08s)]
*  which is no longer considers itself a politically an Islamist party there are anomalies within [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5135.04s)]
*  Tunisia so one of the things that comes to very anomalous and that the minister of justice resigned [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5140.8s)]
*  partially over this issue is it's the only country in the Arab world where you have an [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5146.24s)]
*  a constitutional article that guarantees freedom of conscience article six it's the only country [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5151.28s)]
*  in the Arab world where you can be an atheist and not be not be prosecuted okay you have the [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5156.8s)]
*  legal right to be an atheist however okay which also means you know you have the right to [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5164.4800000000005s)]
*  you know freedom of conscience that's it doesn't have to be explained yet you have a penal code [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5171.360000000001s)]
*  you know code 230 which criminalizes homosexuality okay and there's you know but at the same time [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5176.72s)]
*  you know what is special about Tunisia is that the issue is debated the issue is on the table the [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5183.52s)]
*  unconstitutionality of penal code 230 which I think should be repealed and which many human [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5189.040000000001s)]
*  rights organizations have been pushing for is at least out there talked about in the open just a [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5194.64s)]
*  couple of very quick comments especially with regards to his excellency Salah's point you know [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5201.120000000001s)]
*  there's an old saying no good deed goes unpunished right and you know the the harder you you know you [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5208.48s)]
*  work the luckier you get and Tunisia I think has set the bar higher the expectations of Tunisia are [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5215.679999999999s)]
*  high and I bet you that that's not an easy thing for you as a Tunisian to deal with so my standards [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5223.04s)]
*  or the standards by which I look at how corruption is dealt with or anything else is that within [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5230.719999999999s)]
*  Tunisia is not the same standard that I hold for other Arab countries you know I'm sorry about that [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5237.28s)]
*  finally you're absolutely correct Shaima we cannot move forward if we don't face our history and I [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5244.0s)]
*  think one of the things that you report Marwan and Sahira makes very very clear is that we need to [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5252.08s)]
*  work on both of these things simultaneously we need to strike the right balance because we cannot [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5258.32s)]
*  spend all of our energy dealing with the past we cannot ignore the past also we need to deal with [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5263.28s)]
*  the current corruption and we need to deal with this new problem of corruption right it's new in [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5269.679999999999s)]
*  many many respects but it is you know the my concern is that when we talk about fighting [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5276.48s)]
*  corruption we're often talking about fighting a symptom you know when you fight terrorism you [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5283.84s)]
*  don't go out and annihilate Daesh that's an important part of the task but getting rid of [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5289.36s)]
*  Daesh militarily does not deal with Daeshism as an ideology I think the roots or the factors that [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5295.36s)]
*  have led to this growth in and democratization of corruption is what really needs to be dealt with [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5305.28s)]
*  and in that that takes us back to creating the proper economic opportunities and balancing [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5313.599999999999s)]
*  the market needs with the skills of the of the workforce if you allow me my best anecdote in [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5321.04s)]
*  Tunisia that shows how anomalous Tunisia is from the rest of the Arab world is a meeting we had [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5329.36s)]
*  in Tunisia last month last year in which there were two members of parliament a veiled member [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5337.2s)]
*  from an anna and a secular man from both members of parliament I asked them the same question [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5345.2s)]
*  in front of maybe 50 people in the room if there is a conflict between the Quran and the constitution [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5354.48s)]
*  which do you refer to and the woman even before that when I said look this is this question is [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5363.6s)]
*  settled in tunis when it comes to political issues it's the constitution you will never hear [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5373.92s)]
*  this statement from any other Islamic party in the Arab world so the the maturity that they [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5381.92s)]
*  have achieved in terms of understanding the difference between religion and between political [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5390.08s)]
*  you know daily affairs is is something that I think no other I'm gonna ask you for one question [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5397.44s)]
*  only not one question to each participant because we only have 15 minutes and then I want to [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5405.84s)]
*  to allow the ambassador to give closing remarks also so please and preferably from women I haven't [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5413.2s)]
*  seen many women please thank you marwan for inviting us I heard minister brahim gave a list [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5422.0s)]
*  and also sarah a list of different corruptions being taken place in tunisia [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5437.92s)]
*  would it be possible to prepare or to recommend a calendar of events so that those corruptions [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5444.799999999999s)]
*  could be tackled in within a time limit with of course supervision and assistance from Carnegie [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5454.96s)]
*  and other professionals and for shayma thank you shayma you have been very direct so you don't [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5464.0s)]
*  have to apologize thank you thank you okay so no women want to ask a question thank you [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5470.16s)]
*  from the center for the study of islam and democracy thank you for putting this panel [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5481.84s)]
*  together and for the report I think quick comment about the tunisians in 2014 [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5485.92s)]
*  did not choose secularist over islamist I think they chose those who have a big machine and knew [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5494.72s)]
*  how to turn people in and vote for them they voted both for nida tunis and anahda those are [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5501.68s)]
*  two big blocks some one is secular the other one is anahda as they call themselves the and they [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5507.2s)]
*  chose between two secular you know presidents you know candidates and they chose one over the other [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5515.36s)]
*  so I think the the machine of of turning people to vote it makes a big difference so my question [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5520.639999999999s)]
*  is looking forward to 2019 now that corruption is on the minds of almost everybody you know seeing [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5527.92s)]
*  that this government even though has a big announcement on fighting corruption but from [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5536.799999999999s)]
*  what shayma was describing and sarah there's not there's a lack of seriousness there's a lack of [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5542.08s)]
*  putting your money where your mouth is appointing seven ministers from the bin ali era into this new [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5547.04s)]
*  government that's not serious about fighting corruption and so how can we how can we make [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5553.84s)]
*  sure that corruption is the number one issue in 2019 elections how can we make sure the voices of [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5559.92s)]
*  the youth and those in the interior regions who care about fighting corruption for real how can [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5565.44s)]
*  we get them to to really voice their opinion and make a difference in 2019 and not see the same [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5570.8s)]
*  same faces again one last question please oh sorry sorry michelle you wanted michelle and then you [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5576.8s)]
*  okay let's uh [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5584.320000000001s)]
*  all done from carnegie my questions for you shayma from my observation one of the big victories of [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5590.4800000000005s)]
*  tunisian civil society was the establishing sort of freedom of information and transparency [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5597.28s)]
*  and sort of kicking down the doors early on after the revolution in order to establish the right of [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5604.96s)]
*  citizens to have information about what government officials are doing what the parliament's doing so [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5612.16s)]
*  forth how do you assess that now how do you assess the progress or lack of progress in [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5617.2s)]
*  developing freedom of information and how that affects civil society's ability to be effective [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5623.68s)]
*  in the fight against corruption my name is brenta kurti i'm from the center for international [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5629.76s)]
*  private enterprise i have one and a half questions which i'm hoping you'll let me ask because i'm a [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5639.200000000001s)]
*  woman and you want women to ask questions so so my first question cipe is an organization that really [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5643.12s)]
*  believes in the power of the private sector as a driver for positive change in reform and i'm really [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5652.72s)]
*  interested to have noticed that nobody on this panel mentioned the private sector or business [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5657.360000000001s)]
*  one time in the conversation about corruption um you know given tunisia's history with the private [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5663.04s)]
*  sector given that the private sector has sometimes buried them under a wealth of corruption but then [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5667.76s)]
*  also push them out of constitutional crises i'm really interested to know where you all think the [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5672.240000000001s)]
*  private sector fits in the fight against corruption or the terminology that you would like to use [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5676.72s)]
*  so my second question is about civil society and the NGO's role in in doing some of these things [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5684.240000000001s)]
*  you guys have talked about today so hearing you know ideas for um you know the optimization of [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5690.72s)]
*  policies or encouraging parliamentarians for financial disclosures um i'm really interested [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5698.4800000000005s)]
*  to know if you think that that's something that the government has to change themselves or if [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5704.4s)]
*  there's a place for civil society and NGOs international or domestic to put pressure on [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5708.4s)]
*  them to do that um you know for example if you know the state department were to sponsor [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5712.799999999999s)]
*  a an NGO to do a program where they would encourage i'm like really thinking off the top of [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5720.08s)]
*  my head here where they would create a program for parliamentarians to put a seal on their campaign [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5725.2s)]
*  materials that would indicate that they had signed on to some anti-corruption i'm going to [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5730.5599999999995s)]
*  disclose all of my financial holdings which would maybe increase their appeal for voters like do [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5734.719999999999s)]
*  you think that there's room for those sorts of programs do you think this has to really be [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5740.0s)]
*  government top down or can it be grassroots pressure led two minutes each so far you want to [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5743.92s)]
*  start um sure i mean i'm think you know all of those are great questions and great reminders of [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5751.679999999999s)]
*  the kinds of things that need to be uh paid attention to i think on the the private sector [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5759.28s)]
*  definitely has a huge role to play both in terms of you know fighting the roots of corruption by [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5766.8s)]
*  being active in terms of providing the right kinds of opportunities one of the things i worry about [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5776.32s)]
*  is with the heavy concentration of private sector business in tunis the listen the dichotomy or [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5781.84s)]
*  detention between the coast and the interior of the country is an age-old problem you know and then [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5788.88s)]
*  the issue of economics and franchisement is an age-old problem in 1864 we had the revolt [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5796.320000000001s)]
*  in kasserine for example what i worry about is that businesses that i have been in contact with [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5802.96s)]
*  a lot of them entrepreneurial and young businesses tend to be very focused on tunis [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5813.36s)]
*  and less so on the rest of the country there is a sense also by the youth in the interior of the [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5820.08s)]
*  country of elitism that exists in tunis so they're less willing to try it out in a place like tunis [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5830.639999999999s)]
*  because they're going to be looked down upon based on where they are coming from so i think [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5841.52s)]
*  you know this is something that is both that needs to be done both at the state level and [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5848.080000000001s)]
*  at the cultural level but what i think the business sector the private sector has a huge role to play [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5853.92s)]
*  and again you know not answering the question directly in terms of corruption because i do think [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5860.56s)]
*  that we solve some of the economic problems that underlie the tunisian situation today [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5865.120000000001s)]
*  you disincentivize corruption you know you deal with issues at the economic level in the interior [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5873.360000000001s)]
*  and the south of the country there is less of an incentive there's less of an attraction to [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5882.4800000000005s)]
*  enter the informal economy and to engage in in corrupt activity so i wish that you know maybe [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5888.5599999999995s)]
*  this is something we can discuss further you know after this and because i think the the role of [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5897.839999999999s)]
*  organizations like carnegie can be very very positive in this regard so that's the only one [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5904.5599999999995s)]
*  that i think i can comment on you know the rest were more directed on civil society so i let my [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5913.2s)]
*  colleagues be on those so on 2019 i mean i think one of the things that the parties can do is to [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5918.16s)]
*  have platforms that have real policies and actually come up with ideas of how to address [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5925.679999999999s)]
*  corruption or there could be new parties there could be youth-led parties there could be parties [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5930.639999999999s)]
*  that you know really focus on on corruption i think that it's it's become this buzzword this sort of [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5934.639999999999s)]
*  amorphous idea but actually you know if we want the political system to actually address this the [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5940.16s)]
*  need to to take it on seriously on the private sector so we do have some of this in the report [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5945.12s)]
*  we didn't get a chance to talk about it too much today but the read the report but also you know i [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5949.68s)]
*  would say i think one of the things we talk about is this idea that the private sector has a huge [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5954.0s)]
*  role to play in incentivizing exit options from the informal economy and so particularly we have [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5958.4s)]
*  a whole section on investing in the border regions and why that's really important and i'm not [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5963.84s)]
*  necessarily equating the informal company with corruption but they are tied together and the [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5967.6s)]
*  private sector can come in and create private sector jobs not just public sector jobs to help [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5972.72s)]
*  address those issues and then on the role of sort of bottom-up versus top-down i think both have to [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5977.360000000001s)]
*  occur you know there's definitely a role for civil society and for the international community [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5983.4400000000005s)]
*  to play in pushing government but also in assisting government it doesn't have to be [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5988.0s)]
*  they don't have to be fighting against each other i think you know talking about for example [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5992.8s)]
*  automating government services the private sector can be the one who develops the technology that [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=5996.64s)]
*  does that and the international community in the private sector can pay for it so i think that [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6000.64s)]
*  their more partnership is best for the allowing youth to enter the political market i think [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6004.88s)]
*  this is one of the reasons why municipal elections are the most important elections because in terms [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6016.56s)]
*  of [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6020.96s)]
*  accessibility to the political scene they're the most accessible they don't require lots of money [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6024.0s)]
*  i mean the majority of municipalities in trinitia require a council that has 12 people so even in [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6028.24s)]
*  terms of number it's very easy to create a list to participate in local elections even though a [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6034.88s)]
*  lot of political parties say they're not ready and they do not want municipal elections i think [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6043.68s)]
*  those who can be ready are the youth who are independent let's just say i'm not against [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6049.44s)]
*  partisan politics but obviously there's a lot of disinterest in this kind of politics [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6053.28s)]
*  instead of convincing youth that you know you need to be part of this or this political party you can [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6058.48s)]
*  convince them to take part of the tools that are existing in representative democracy and among [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6063.36s)]
*  which is the municipal elections freedom of information this is actually one of the things [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6068.4s)]
*  that i think tunisia is really leading in this topic and i think we're doing an excellent job [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6075.12s)]
*  but we can do access to information one of the most revolutionary decrees that were [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6083.599999999999s)]
*  published or passed in tunisia after the revolution was the decree 41 which gives allows access to [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6092.08s)]
*  official documents not information 2016 there was a law that was passed which allows access to [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6099.2s)]
*  information this law basically allows access to everything with the exception of issues that are [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6104.64s)]
*  related to national security and personal personal information but those are not [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6112.64s)]
*  absolute exceptions you can even challenge those exceptions again i'm going to talk about facts [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6119.6s)]
*  this law also introduces this new committee or commission we'll call the access to information [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6124.8s)]
*  commission it's elected by the parliament supposed to be in place for the past year [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6129.04s)]
*  is not in place the government has not programmed any money or budget for this committee [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6134.72s)]
*  for details but this is an example of how the government can show read commitment we're also [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6141.28s)]
*  part of the ogp the open government partnership which has its risks i mean it's a great thing [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6146.08s)]
*  because it gives a label that this country is committed to open government but it also means [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6154.5599999999995s)]
*  you're going at a pace at an international pace which usually were always overqualified which can [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6159.599999999999s)]
*  translate into that the best example i want to give is when i used to be in al-bausala we used [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6166.5599999999995s)]
*  to push for the government to publish budgets in an open uh in an open format so something that [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6175.679999999999s)]
*  looks like xm the government kept on saying that you know they would they would get to a full [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6181.76s)]
*  full grade because they were publishing them in pdf so why should you publish them in excel [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6187.6s)]
*  the world bank was okay with it why should we change this this is the risk that comes with [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6192.16s)]
*  international cooperation yeah uh which i'm going to talk about when we talk about programs or how [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6195.92s)]
*  how can we uh collaborate with international and national organizations when it comes to the private [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6201.76s)]
*  sector i think the private sector is part of the problem but also part of the solution so capital [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6206.64s)]
*  is very linked with politics in tune in like everywhere else in the world um i think the [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6211.92s)]
*  solution is for entrepreneurs to enter the market because the great thing about entrepreneurs is [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6217.12s)]
*  that they're young usually they're very politically aware and conscious and they're not linked to any [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6221.4400000000005s)]
*  real political party uh so have nothing to lose they have a lot to gain if they push for good [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6227.52s)]
*  practices because usually they are um they they um they uh face a lot of the problems that citizens [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6232.4s)]
*  all of the other sectors face and a lot of injustice and getting permits and imports and whatnot so they [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6241.759999999999s)]
*  have um they they have a lot to take so they would push for a change however when it comes to uh the [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6247.28s)]
*  noble peace prize i went to the quartet which one of among which was the one kind of the public [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6254.8s)]
*  sector which is more the traditional too big to fail private sector i think it's very interesting [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6262.72s)]
*  to raise questions about that uh programs programs are great investing in um in civil society's [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6269.6s)]
*  excellence however it comes you know it comes with its risks i have seen and witnessed in parliament [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6276.0s)]
*  in the tunisian parliament how certain partnerships can actually push for um marginalization of [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6282.16s)]
*  tunisian civil society for example pushing for best practices that worked in a lot of countries [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6290.16s)]
*  in the world but do not necessarily respond to practices in tunisia i was told as president as [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6296.48s)]
*  previous president of al-bausala that we're lucky that we don't need to submit our speeches to the [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6301.84s)]
*  bureau of the parliament before having a hearing in parliament so you know the low-hanging fruits [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6308.0s)]
*  you should be very happy that the parliament is open while what we were requesting was an automatic [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6315.68s)]
*  way to request hearings and to enter parliament so it comes with a risk i think the best thing is to [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6321.92s)]
*  make sure that the tunisian counterpart can actually negotiate those partnerships not to [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6328.8s)]
*  risk or to threaten the existing positive elements that we have thank you so much i want to [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6334.4s)]

*  it is putting tunisia on the map discussing real issues and very very accurate issues about tunisia [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6410.4s)]
*  and actually as as a nascent democracy we are we are open to very good and instructive informative [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6420.08s)]
*  discussions like this one so i've been listening very carefully to all what have been said has been [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6432.4s)]
*  said and of course i'll i'll read the report more than once because it is important to understand [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6439.2s)]
*  what is what is said but also what are the recommendations so that's what we need a reality [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6449.2s)]
*  we know we know and as mr rahim said we know the reality of the country we know what's going on [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6456.16s)]
*  in the country we know all the problems related to corruption in the country and one of the reasons [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6463.36s)]
*  that i don't want to say the main reason of the uh 2011 revolution was corruption because it was [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6469.679999999999s)]
*  spread out all over the country and uh it took a magnitude that was not tolerated it cannot be [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6480.08s)]
*  tolerated anymore i serve usually as a diplomat marwan i i serve abroad i was in so many capitals [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6488.24s)]
*  and when i land in tunisia the first thing i hear from everyone is how much corruption is [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6496.08s)]
*  is spread out you talked marwan about and the panel also talked about uh democratization of of [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6505.68s)]
*  the phenomenon yes indeed it is it is a new phenomenon but also we have to talk about the [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6513.839999999999s)]
*  democratization of dealing with the issue now everybody in tunisia is is very supportive of [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6522.16s)]
*  any initiative to stop the phenomenon and to deal with the phenomenon and to find find out solution [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6530.32s)]
*  for the problem because it's not tolerated anymore now that the country is open that the country is [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6538.48s)]
*  democratized that we have a vibrant and very dynamic civil society the issue is not tolerated [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6544.88s)]
*  anymore and sooner or later solution will be fine to the problem we we are sometimes in hurry and [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6553.36s)]
*  asking maybe this government or the previous government or even the net the future government [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6562.4s)]
*  to do more and to accelerate the process it's not an easy process it is a complicated complex process [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6568.16s)]
*  and a long run process since it relies to different stakeholders on the deep reforms [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6579.44s)]
*  and on the mindless development repudiating uh repudiating the culture of impunity this is very [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6588.0s)]
*  important now the these these uh phenomenon of impunity in tunisia is over everyone knows now that [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6595.2s)]
*  once you uh get into corruption you have to face uh justice because everybody is watching now [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6607.92s)]
*  everybody in fact therefore measuring the success of the failure of this process should not be [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6618.08s)]
*  impulsive nor based on perceptions i would like here to quote daniel kaufman president and CEO [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6625.12s)]
*  of natural resource governance institute who said fighting corruption is not talking about [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6634.0s)]
*  tunisia is talking in general fighting corruption requires a new understanding of how the global [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6640.0s)]
*  problem has evolved global problem has evolved merely adopting a new anti-corruption law creating [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6648.16s)]
*  another commission or launching another campaign will not get the job done we can no longer fight [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6656.08s)]
*  corruption by simply fighting corruption alone corruption is a symptom of a larger disease [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6664.0s)]
*  the failure of institutions and governance and it is it also it is also a heritage you know we [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6670.88s)]
*  inherited this from the past it's not it's not the result of the government that came right after [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6679.5199999999995s)]
*  the revolution corruption is a symptom of a large disease the failure of institutions and governments [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6688.32s)]
*  resulting in poor management of revenues and resources and an absence an absence of delivery [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6696.8s)]
*  of public goods and services unquote it means that the problem first is is global and it is [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6703.52s)]
*  also urgent and important for any society and for any democracy to tackle the problem and to find out [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6713.52s)]
*  solution and that's what this government was doing when when the sorry when the prime minister [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6722.16s)]
*  visited washington early july last july we had a private dinner and the CEO president CEO of gallop [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6729.84s)]
*  had had dinner with us and he said mr prime minister i have seen some figures and i'm not [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6742.24s)]
*  sure that they are right or not and i would like to ask you directly a question [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6749.84s)]
*  is it true that your popularity now in tunisia is 73 percent [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6755.68s)]
*  he said yes it's true but if you asked me this question few months ago i would say it's only 37 [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6762.88s)]
*  percent but because he took you know the responsibility and the initiative to fight [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6770.0s)]
*  corruption and he started what so many other governments didn't do unfortunately during the [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6780.48s)]
*  last few days so all stockholders if you want to use this word but also people from all over the [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6788.0s)]
*  regions and all over the ages just supported the government and it was a full support from everyone [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6796.96s)]
*  because everyone feels that we should start one day and hopefully this government and this [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6804.88s)]
*  head of government took the responsibility and took his responsibility between in two hands as [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6812.64s)]
*  we say and he started the process as i said earlier which is long and difficult one [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6818.32s)]
*  second second characteristic of the strategy needs a whole of society roadmap where not only [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6828.16s)]
*  the government's responsibility are involved but those of a whole range of other actors starting [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6836.719999999999s)]
*  from the judiciary and it was said in this panel the parliament the political parties the civil [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6844.0s)]
*  society the media and ending i don't know if it is ending or starting i'm not sure by the citizens [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6850.4s)]
*  themselves this is the responsibility of everyone in the country not only in tunisia but in general [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6859.04s)]
*  and it's unbelievable now that people using these these smartphone or these these gadgets now are [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6865.76s)]
*  are filming or taking pictures or you know registering any movement sometimes you know for [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6876.64s)]
*  people asking for vibrancy so the phenomenon now became popular and as i said is democratized now [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6887.04s)]
*  not only corruption is democratized but also fighting corruption should be democratized every [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6894.16s)]
*  single stockholders has a crucial role in the process even when it comes to handling the past [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6901.44s)]
*  or what the report calls the short-term version of counting corruption third it is a challenging [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6909.28s)]
*  and painful process that supposes push back and resistance of course we [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6916.72s)]
*  it was said here in this podium that of course many forces many resistant forces will not allow [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6925.68s)]
*  the phenomenon to to to to go forward but it is our responsibility the responsibility of all [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6932.320000000001s)]
*  stockholders also to resist to this resistance because if you fail to fight the phenomenon the [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6939.04s)]
*  phenomenon will be really generalized and you cannot do anything about it it is a challenging [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6947.92s)]
*  and painful process that supposed pushback and resistance therefore it is important to be prepared [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6957.68s)]
*  to counter the bad actors actions and maneuvers it is finally a learning process for all stock [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6964.0s)]
*  stockholders indeed Tunisia is leading a deep move in the region by implementing new concepts [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6972.88s)]
*  of inclusive governance transparency social contract and accountability for that purpose [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6981.04s)]
*  it should rely on other countries experiences and best practices adapted to our reality [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6989.2s)]
*  system and priorities to address these challenges and complex issue Tunisia deserves a [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=6996.0s)]
*  multi-dimensional support and a set of tools consistent mainly in the following first [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=7004.16s)]
*  empowering all the stockholders mainly the official and anti-corruption bodies [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=7011.76s)]
*  and that's think this government is serious about that relevant society organization but also the [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=7017.2s)]
*  government itself and the public administration of course this requires human and financial [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=7024.24s)]
*  resources capacity building and technical assistance second consolidating the trust [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=7030.5599999999995s)]
*  and sarah you mentioned this more than once in in your in your presentation consolidating the trust [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=7038.639999999999s)]
*  between all the stockholders and building sustainable framework and channels of dialogue [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=7045.12s)]
*  and partnership between them is very important we have good good news anyway as rightly reported [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=7051.28s)]
*  by Carnegie page 24 I quote civil society has played a crucial role in informing the official [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=7060.24s)]
*  anti-corruption process several anti-corruption laws were drafted in consultation with domestic [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=7068.4s)]
*  civil society groups and international organizations so show it be the chairperson of the national [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=7075.12s)]
*  anti-corruption authority noted that one of the first steps to took was the to forge a coalition [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=7083.12s)]
*  with civil society which was formalized with a signed document it's important the civil society [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=7090.5599999999995s)]
*  is involved of course there are some weaknesses but we are we are working on that not only the [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=7100.64s)]
*  government but also this civil society itself by being every day asking for better and more [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvD_qQZ09h8&t=7108.160000000001s)]
