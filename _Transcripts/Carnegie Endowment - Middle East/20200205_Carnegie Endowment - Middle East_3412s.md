# Saudi Arabia and Iranâ€™s Forty Year Rivalry
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [February 05, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I)
*  Good morning everyone and welcome. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=0.0s)]
*  My name is Bill Burns. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=8.28s)]
*  I'm the president of the Carnegie Endowment. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=9.28s)]
*  If you wanted to understand the roots and the consequences of today's tumult in the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=12.24s)]
*  Middle East, you've come to the right place. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=16.76s)]
*  We're all extremely fortunate to have with us today two of the very best journalists [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=19.52s)]
*  and two of the very sharpest analysts of the region that I know. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=23.96s)]
*  We're especially pleased to help launch Kim Gaddis's new book Black Wave, an exceptional [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=27.36s)]
*  guide to an exceptionally complex part of the world. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=33.04s)]
*  Born and raised in Beirut, Kim spent nearly two decades as a Middle East and State Department [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=36.56s)]
*  correspondent for the Financial Times and the BBC. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=41.28s)]
*  No stranger to political instability or long flights, Kim has reported from nearly every [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=45.72s)]
*  country in the region and crisscrossed the world with Secretaries of State Rice, Clinton [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=50.88s)]
*  and Kerry. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=55.6s)]
*  Kim's previous book, the New York Times bestseller The Secretary, explored the Middle East through [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=57.24s)]
*  the lens of US diplomacy and power. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  In The Black Wave, she provides an inverse angle, providing a range of perspectives from [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=65.56s)]
*  the region about where and how things went wrong in this land of unintended consequences. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=71.04s)]
*  It offers a fascinating story and artfully interwoven narratives, taking a thoughtful [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=77.54s)]
*  look at the history of Saudi-Iranian rivalry and all of the fallout that has been left [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=82.0s)]
*  in its wake. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=87.28s)]
*  Only someone of Kim's extraordinary gifts, experience and expertise could paint a picture [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=89.16s)]
*  as vivid, as nuanced or as gripping as what she has produced in Black Wave. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=93.83999999999999s)]
*  It's a captivating read that somehow manages to be both intimate in its storytelling and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=98.96s)]
*  expansive in its scope, spanning beach towns in Lebanon, seminaries in Iran, protest camps [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=103.61999999999999s)]
*  in Tahrir Square and the battlefields of Aleppo. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=109.47999999999999s)]
*  Like Kim, David Ignatius has also reported extensively from the far reaches of the Middle [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=113.16s)]
*  East and from the deepest corridors of power. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=117.82s)]
*  Few people have as perceptive and authoritative a sense of American foreign policy and its [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=121.32s)]
*  key players. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=126.84s)]
*  His eloquent and insightful columns drive and shape public debate, and they also keep [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=127.84s)]
*  policymakers honest and wider discussion about policy grounded in reality, sometimes seen [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=133.32s)]
*  as a novel thought in this era. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=139.2s)]
*  If you haven't already purchased a copy or three of Kim's book, you'll have the opportunity [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=142.0s)]
*  to do so and to get it signed after today's program. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  Those thanks again for coming today, and please join me in a very warm welcome for Kim Gaddis [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=150.2s)]
*  and David Ignatius. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=155.2s)]
*  Thank you, Bill. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=158.2s)]
*  So ladies and gentlemen, I'm delighted to be able to host this conversation with Kim, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=165.68s)]
*  who is a colleague who I've known for many years, whose journalism I've respected at [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  the BBC and the Financial Times. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  She has a magical name for me because, as I told her when I first met you, in 1982 during [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=180.24s)]
*  the Israeli siege of Beirut, the only telex machine that was working in West Beirut, or [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=187.8s)]
*  at least at the Commodore Hotel where the journalists were, had the telex address GATAS. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=194.92s)]
*  And I've always thought, wow, that was power. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=201.64s)]
*  Kim, you- [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=206.24s)]
*  You propelled me to Washington, I guess. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=208.51999999999998s)]
*  You have had such an outstanding career that you could say that you achieved escape velocity [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=211.96s)]
*  from the world of Lebanon and the Middle East and covering all those enormously difficult [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=219.52s)]
*  issues. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=227.52s)]
*  But with this book, you really jumped in with a journalist's eye for detail and also an [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=229.28s)]
*  historian's sense of deeper roots and context. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=236.68s)]
*  And I'd like to ask you to begin by telling us why you decided to do this. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=241.12s)]
*  Where did the idea for this book come from? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  Thank you so much for agreeing to this conversation. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  You were one of my inspirations as a journalist in Beirut when I first met you. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  I was in awe of this Washington Post columnist journalist that I was able to interview in [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=256.0s)]
*  Beirut. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=261.24s)]
*  Here I am sitting next to you on the stage. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=262.56s)]
*  Carnegie, thank you to everyone at Carnegie for having me. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=265.28s)]
*  I wanted to just start by saying that. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=268.4s)]
*  The book started to percolate in my head in 2014 when ISIS was on the rise taking over [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=272.96s)]
*  large swathes of land in Iraq and Syria. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=281.64s)]
*  And what was particularly striking about that episode was the wanton destruction of culture, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=286.56s)]
*  of artifacts, of museums, the burning of libraries, this sort of desire to burn the past so that [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=293.59999999999997s)]
*  they could control the future. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=300.84000000000003s)]
*  And this cultural desertification that somewhere I recognized in not as an extreme form but [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=303.8s)]
*  that I had seen before in a country like Saudi Arabia where museums were allowed, where representation [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=310.88s)]
*  is not allowed, where cinemas were forbidden, where there was no music. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=316.6s)]
*  And it started to get me thinking about what was it in this puritanical thinking that had [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=321.48s)]
*  traveled this far. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=327.64000000000004s)]
*  And a lot of people were making comparisons that are not perfect but were making comparisons [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=330.2s)]
*  between the puritanical literalist expression of Islam in the kingdom and what ISIS was [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=335.47999999999996s)]
*  doing. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=344.96s)]
*  Of course ISIS also targets Saudi Arabia in its rhetoric but there was something there [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=345.96s)]
*  that I recognized. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=350.08s)]
*  And then later that year my sister, I was in Beirut, my sister went to visit south Lebanon [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=351.15999999999997s)]
*  with a friend of hers who had grown up in south Lebanon near the town of Nabatiyeh which [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=356.32s)]
*  is today a stronghold of Hezbollah, the Shia militant group. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=360.8s)]
*  And she told me that her friend was very dismayed when she took my sister because she suddenly [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=367.21999999999997s)]
*  realized there wasn't much to do. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=371.48s)]
*  She wanted to show off her town and she was like actually there are no cafes, there's [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=373.03999999999996s)]
*  really no cultural life beyond what Hezbollah offers. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=377.2s)]
*  And that got me thinking about well you know we're all so focused or many of us are focused [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=381.71999999999997s)]
*  on criticizing the Saudis for what they may have produced as offspring but there has been [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=385.9s)]
*  previous episodes of cultural desertification and that happened with the rise of groups [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=393.46s)]
*  like Hezbollah in Lebanon in the 80s, an export of the Islamic revolution of Iran and it happened [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=398.97999999999996s)]
*  in Iran publicly certainly. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=405.46s)]
*  And so I started wondering were these connected, was this a competition, how did this all start? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=408.5s)]
*  And why this assault on culture and how did it change us over those decades? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=415.86s)]
*  And that brought me to the year 1979 where I found that it was the starting point of [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=423.18s)]
*  this rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran on various fronts, geopolitical but also religious [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=429.54s)]
*  and cultural. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=438.2s)]
*  The power of this book I think begins with your identification of 1979 as the fulcrum [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=441.04s)]
*  on which so much of subsequent history is balanced. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=451.16s)]
*  We have memories or certainly we've read often enough about what happened in Iran in 1979 [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=456.16s)]
*  with the revolution and then the seizure of the American embassy but we know less about [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=463.44s)]
*  what was going on in the kingdom by design because they didn't want people to know. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=470.86s)]
*  So maybe a starting point in trying to understand how Saudi Arabia reacted to the extremism [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=476.24s)]
*  and idealism of the Iranian revolution is to tell us about what happened in Mecca in [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=485.24s)]
*  late 1979. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=491.76s)]
*  Well to back up just a little bit, the initial reaction of the Saudi kingdom was to welcome [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=493.74s)]
*  the Saudi revolution, the Iranian revolution. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=499.44s)]
*  And I knew that of course the Saudis and the Iranians, the Saudi king and the Iranian Shah [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=502.72s)]
*  were friendly rivals before 1979, before the Iranian revolution. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=509.72s)]
*  They were twin pillars in US policy to contain communism and the Soviet Union and that is [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=514.88s)]
*  something that is often forgotten even by experts. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=521.88s)]
*  We forget that there was this cooperation that they were not always enemies, it's only [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=524.44s)]
*  been 40 years. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=528.9s)]
*  But what really surprised me was to find a headline in Arabic as we were digging in [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=531.02s)]
*  the archives of newspapers, as Saudi to shield the Saudi's praise the Iranian revolution [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=534.66s)]
*  because they saw, you know they were probably upset or sad for their friend the Shah whom [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=542.6999999999999s)]
*  they supported till the very end. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=548.3s)]
*  They were still putting out statements that they supported the Shah until early January [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=549.5s)]
*  and of course Khomeini returned in February. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=553.6999999999999s)]
*  They were worried about a communist takeover of Iran initially because Khomeini was in [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=557.08s)]
*  fact surrounded and the revolution was mostly propelled forward at the time by the more [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=562.0s)]
*  secular, more leftist, more modernist thinkers around Khomeini. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=567.2800000000001s)]
*  So initially the Saudis were like, well this guy looks like us, he's about conservative [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=571.6800000000001s)]
*  religion, he's puritanical, he wants to bring Sharia to Iran, we can deal with that and [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=576.84s)]
*  Prince Abdullah, later King Abdullah also put out a statement saying that they were [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=582.36s)]
*  very pleased that the terms of cooperation between the two countries could be on the [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=586.6s)]
*  basis of religion, Islam and the Quran. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=590.8s)]
*  They hadn't read some of Khomeini's other writings and then they realized that they [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=594.76s)]
*  were in for a big surprise. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=599.7199999999999s)]
*  But what happened in the kingdom was the siege of the Holy Mosque of Mecca in November of [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=601.24s)]
*  that year when Saudi zalats who, there's no evidence that they were inspired by what [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=607.0s)]
*  happened in Iran but I think the Iranian revolution was rippling out to Sunni countries. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=613.76s)]
*  People were inspired all the way in Egypt and in Pakistan by what someone like Khomeini [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=620.56s)]
*  had achieved. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=624.76s)]
*  And so what you have in Saudi Arabia is a two week siege of the Mosque of Mecca by Saudi [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=626.36s)]
*  zalats, some of whom had been groomed by the leading clerics of the establishment in [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=631.32s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, including the man who would later become the mufti of Saudi Arabia, Abdul [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=635.64s)]
*  Aziz bin Baaz. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=639.4s)]
*  And they lay siege to the Holy Mosque because their calls are for a much more conservative [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=641.12s)]
*  application of the religious law, even more conservative than the kingdom already is. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=647.52s)]
*  They oppose the presence of Westerners in the country on, you know, holy soil in the [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=652.76s)]
*  peninsula. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=658.2s)]
*  And the kingdom finds itself undermined in its leadership role of the Muslim world and [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=659.36s)]
*  its custodianship of the two holy sites of Mecca, of Saudi Arabia. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=665.96s)]
*  And questions are raised around the Arab world, including coming from Egypt and Al-Azhar about [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=671.0s)]
*  this failure. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=676.2s)]
*  The reaction is instead of the Saudis deciding that they should temper the ardors of such [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=678.32s)]
*  zalats. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=687.4s)]
*  Of course, the siege ends with a lot of deaths and most of the protagonists are killed or [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=688.4s)]
*  put to death. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=693.8399999999999s)]
*  But their ideas are taken on by the clerics and the Saudi royal family because they want [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=695.36s)]
*  to protect their throne. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=701.0799999999999s)]
*  They don't want to face more threats from people like that and from the clerics who [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=702.8s)]
*  find this to be the opportunity for them to push their agenda even more forward in the [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=706.88s)]
*  kingdom for an even more conservative application of Islamic law. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=712.76s)]
*  This character that you mentioned, Abdulaziz bin Bas, figures through many parts of your [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=717.52s)]
*  narrative. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=724.44s)]
*  I have a personal recollection. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=725.44s)]
*  The first time I visited the kingdom of Saudi Arabia was in early 1981. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=726.8000000000001s)]
*  The kind of aftermath still echoed. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=735.44s)]
*  We went to an Islamic summit in Taif in the mountains fairly near Mecca. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=739.44s)]
*  And you could just see how hard the kingdom was working to seem fiercely Islamic. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=746.44s)]
*  The third key element of your 1979 narrative is Afghanistan. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=756.44s)]
*  I want you to talk about both what was happening in Afghanistan with the Soviet invasion and [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=765.44s)]
*  the Saudi role, as they've got all these extreme Wahhabi, Salafist radicals, and spying this [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=772.44s)]
*  country in Afghanistan to kind of deal with this. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=782.44s)]
*  So talk about that piece. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=786.44s)]
*  The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan happens on Christmas Eve of 1979. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=788.44s)]
*  And of course, I use 79 as the starting point of the narrative because it is such a key [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=795.44s)]
*  turning point. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=801.44s)]
*  But of course, nothing happens in a vacuum. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=802.44s)]
*  79 didn't just all of a sudden happen. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=804.44s)]
*  All these events have trends that precede them. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=806.44s)]
*  And so the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan is the culmination of several years of guerrilla [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=810.44s)]
*  warfare in the country and Soviet involvement and coups, et cetera. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=817.44s)]
*  And then on Christmas Eve, there is the landing of hundreds of troops. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=820.44s)]
*  And it's identified very quickly by the Saudis and the Pakistanis and the Americans as a [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=827.44s)]
*  flashpoint where to push back against Soviet influence. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=835.44s)]
*  And for the Saudis, it becomes this place where they can show that they are the real [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=838.44s)]
*  defenders of the faith. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=846.44s)]
*  They may have failed in Mecca, but they can make up for it in Afghanistan by helping to [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=848.44s)]
*  fund and promote the idea of jihad against the godless communists. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=857.44s)]
*  So it becomes the cause celebre inside Saudi Arabia where young people are encouraged to [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=864.44s)]
*  go there. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=871.44s)]
*  People donate. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=872.44s)]
*  There are telethons to donate for this effort. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=873.44s)]
*  And more importantly, young men from around the Arab and Muslim world, from Egypt or Pakistan [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=875.44s)]
*  or Iraq, well, probably not Iraq, but Syria, travel to Afghanistan to fight the Soviets. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=882.44s)]
*  And these are young men who are still marginal elements in their societies as people who [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=888.44s)]
*  espouse a more extremist or violent understanding of Islam. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=894.44s)]
*  They're marginal in their country, but they all congregate in Afghanistan and they meet on the [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=899.44s)]
*  battlefield. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=904.44s)]
*  And they're drunk on power and on the idea that you can use the weapon to fight the enemy and [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=905.44s)]
*  you can use the word to bring down your tyrant as the Iranian revolution did in Tehran. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=912.44s)]
*  We know famously that among the enthusiasts for getting all these extreme anti-Soviet [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=919.44s)]
*  fighters was the CIA. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=929.44s)]
*  And that America ended up abetting the movement of Mujahideen fighters that then morphs later into [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=934.44s)]
*  al-Qaeda. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=946.44s)]
*  We're here in the home of one of the people I respect most in the State Department from that [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=947.44s)]
*  period. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=955.44s)]
*  I just want to ask you whether, as you did your research, you encountered misgivings, concerns, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=956.44s)]
*  not just on the part of U.S. officials, but among people in the region. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=964.44s)]
*  Looking back, we can see things beginning to slip away towards what's been decades of increasing [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=969.44s)]
*  violence and extremism. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=978.44s)]
*  Did people see that at the time and say, wait a minute, stopping the Soviets is not worth the [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=982.44s)]
*  cost of what we're creating? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=988.44s)]
*  It's very hard to understand precisely the consequences of the actions you're taking as a [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=991.44s)]
*  regional power or a superpower, I think, in the moment. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=998.44s)]
*  And that's why it takes a while to understand the trend lines and to understand why 79 was so [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1002.44s)]
*  crucial as a turning point. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1009.44s)]
*  That was not just a geopolitical turning point because it turned Iran and Saudi Arabia into [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1010.44s)]
*  rivals, but because it also unleashed this sea change across the region in terms of how people [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1015.44s)]
*  understand and experience their culture and their religion, because the Saudis and the Iranians [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1025.44s)]
*  used all tools at their disposal to rally people to their camp, and that included religion and [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1029.44s)]
*  culture. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1036.44s)]
*  But at the time, that was the good war. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1037.44s)]
*  The war against the Soviets was the good war. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1040.44s)]
*  And so everyone was a happy participant, including Ziyal Haq, who thought this was his chance to [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1042.44s)]
*  consolidate his position at home as a dictator who was initially not very loved and not necessarily [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1048.44s)]
*  backed by anyone forcefully, but he became essential to the battle in Afghanistan against the [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1054.44s)]
*  Soviets. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1060.44s)]
*  But even though it was a good war, there were some people who were very concerned about the [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1062.44s)]
*  types of mujahideen groups that were getting the full support of the Saudis. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1067.44s)]
*  And one of these people was Jamal Khashoggi. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1072.44s)]
*  Jamal Khashoggi was a reporter at the time. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1074.44s)]
*  He was in Peshawar. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1077.44s)]
*  There's a section in the book that tells the story of how Peshawar becomes this petri dish of [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1078.44s)]
*  hatred in the 80s. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1083.44s)]
*  And Jamal Khashoggi is there as a journalist, and he's very concerned about the fact that the [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1085.44s)]
*  groups that are getting the most funding and the most support are those groups that espouse the [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1090.44s)]
*  most radical thinking. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1095.44s)]
*  And he thinks, and a lot of people agreed at the time, and looking back now, you can see where [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1096.44s)]
*  some of these mistakes were made. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1100.44s)]
*  They were not necessarily representative of what the majority of Afghans who opposed Soviet [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1102.44s)]
*  occupation would have wanted, but they were the chosen ones by the Saudis. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1108.44s)]
*  They got preferential treatment. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1112.44s)]
*  They got more funding. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1114.44s)]
*  They got more support from the Saudi clerics, including bin Baz. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1115.44s)]
*  Just again, a footnote for me. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1118.44s)]
*  After my colleague Jamal's murder, I was trying to draw an account of his life. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1122.44s)]
*  And I talked to a friend of his named Barney Barnett Rubin, our leading American expert on [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1131.44s)]
*  Afghanistan. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1138.44s)]
*  And Barney remembered meeting Jamal. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1139.44s)]
*  He'd gone to the kingdom in, I think it was 1981, but Jamal was just back from a trip to [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1143.44s)]
*  Afghanistan where he dressed up in Mujeddin clothes and was wearing RPG rockets and this and that. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1151.44s)]
*  Anyway, he was pretty out there. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1160.44s)]
*  And he meets Barney Rubin for the first time, and he begins denouncing then-Governor Riyadh- [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1162.44s)]
*  Prince Salman. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1171.44s)]
*  Prince Salman, now King Salman, for supporting these Salafist extremists. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1172.44s)]
*  And Barney remembers like, he'd never met me before. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1178.44s)]
*  Jamal was always very candid. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1183.44s)]
*  Telling us American, but your point that he was critical and worried and a rare person who was [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1186.44s)]
*  willing to say so. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1193.44s)]
*  And there was talk of supporting different kind of leadership for the Mujahideen. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1194.44s)]
*  One of them was named Rani, and he had a more Sufi leaning in his approach to Islam. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1200.44s)]
*  He was more representative. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1207.44s)]
*  He was much more popular inside Afghanistan than the ones who ended up being chosen. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1208.44s)]
*  But clerics like Abdulaziz Bin Baz put a foot down, as I understood from Saudi friends, and said, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1213.44s)]
*  we're not having that. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1220.44s)]
*  That's not who we want. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1221.44s)]
*  I want to ask you about one more fascinating moment in 1979 that still haunts many people and is [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1222.44s)]
*  one of the what-if moments when we think of this narrative. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1231.44s)]
*  And that is the disappearance and then we later learn the death of a charismatic Lebanese cleric [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1235.44s)]
*  named Musa Sader. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1242.44s)]
*  Just tell us briefly that story, because I'll bet many people don't know it, and it's fascinating. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1243.44s)]
*  It is an incredible story. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1248.44s)]
*  It is a what-if moment. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1250.44s)]
*  It actually takes place just before 1979 in 1978. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1251.44s)]
*  Musa Sader was a very popular, charismatic Shia cleric from Iran who had come to Lebanon. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1255.44s)]
*  His forefathers were originally from Lebanon but had emigrated to Iran back in the 17th century [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1263.44s)]
*  around then or before. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1273.44s)]
*  But Musa Sader had come back to Lebanon to lead the Shia community, give them a voice because they [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1276.44s)]
*  were the downtrodden of the country. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1282.44s)]
*  And he was an advocate for more rights, more representation, more equality for the Shia community in Lebanon. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1284.44s)]
*  He was very secular, actually, in his outlook as well. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1290.44s)]
*  He was not a man who thought that religion should rule in politics. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1295.44s)]
*  And he preached in churches and gave lectures at Christian universities just as much as he went to [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1299.44s)]
*  mosques or supported the rights of Shias in the country. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1306.44s)]
*  He was beloved across Lebanon by a lot of people, and he was seen as a leader who could rise also [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1311.44s)]
*  potentially perhaps in a country like Iran as the Shah came under fire and was in trouble and the [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1319.44s)]
*  uprising there, the revolution was accelerating. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1326.44s)]
*  There was some contact between the Shah and Musa Sader. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1330.44s)]
*  And Musa Sader warned the Shah about Khomeini and his thinking. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1334.44s)]
*  And there's this line that is really incredible that I relay in my book that was in a different book, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1340.44s)]
*  The Fall of Heaven, where Musa Sader warns the Shah that Khomeini's writing is the juice of a sick mind. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1347.44s)]
*  He realized that there was real danger there for tyrannical theocracy if this man should ever get a hold on power. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1355.44s)]
*  Musa Sader travels to Libya in August of 78 and disappears there with his companions, never to be seen again. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1363.44s)]
*  And we later learn that close acolyte of Khomeini, Ayatollah Behishti, and Yasser Arafat, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1373.44s)]
*  chairman of the PLO, and we can get to that aspect of the story if you want, David, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1384.44s)]
*  were in connivance with Muammar Khadafi to make Musa Sader disappear because somebody like Behishti [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1390.44s)]
*  understood the threat that someone like Musa Sader posed for Khomeini, either because he could find a compromise, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1398.44s)]
*  either because Musa Sader could find a compromise with the Shah to try to appease the anger on the street [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1407.44s)]
*  and put forward a new form of government. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1415.44s)]
*  There were some talk maybe even that he could become prime minister of Iran under the Shah, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1418.44s)]
*  and that would bring moderate religion to power. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1423.44s)]
*  Or perhaps Khomeini and his acolytes thought that Musa Sader could rise in the post-Shah period [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1428.44s)]
*  and challenge Khomeini's role because he wanted more than he said he wanted. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1434.44s)]
*  And so Musa Sader disappears in Libya in 1978, never to be seen again. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1440.44s)]
*  And at the same time, almost within two days, another what if, Saddam Hussein, vice president of Iraq, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1447.44s)]
*  calls the Shah and says, you know, this guy Khomeini sitting in Najaf is becoming a bit of a nuisance, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1456.44s)]
*  rabble-razzer, he's also causing trouble within Iraq now, my own Shia community is starting to listen to him. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1463.44s)]
*  What if we just get rid of him? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1470.44s)]
*  And the Shah says no. The Shah doesn't want to go that route. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1473.44s)]
*  There probably would have been other consequences had he said yes, turn Ayatollah Khomeini into a martyr. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1478.44s)]
*  But those two moments where Musa Sader dies and Khomeini lives is really one of those incredible what ifs moment in history. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1484.44s)]
*  So in your book, the whirlwind begins to spin faster and faster. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1492.44s)]
*  The intensity of the rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran increases. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1500.44s)]
*  Saddam becomes the paramount ruler of Iraq in 1979. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1507.44s)]
*  That's another little moment. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1513.44s)]
*  But soon we're into the Iran-Iraq war. Saudi Arabia, in effect, is helping to finance Iraq's stand against the Shia revolution. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1517.44s)]
*  And meanwhile, the Saudis are allowing these very extreme clerics to operate both at home and increasingly in Pakistan and Afghanistan. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1533.44s)]
*  So just say a few words about that accelerating process. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1545.44s)]
*  And again, the question I have when I look back is, did anybody see how dangerous this was and try to stop it? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1552.44s)]
*  I don't think so. I don't think so because the question that I asked a lot of it is the question that I asked a lot of people when I was doing my reporting. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1560.44s)]
*  Did you realize at the time that this is where things were going, including in Saudi Arabia? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1572.44s)]
*  You know, Hamad bin Salman likes to say that the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia likes to say that before 1979, Saudi Arabia was much more tolerant, much more progressive, much more open. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1577.44s)]
*  You know, he's right to some extent, particularly if you're speaking about the province of Hejaz, which is on the Red Sea, which is home to Mecca and Medina, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1590.44s)]
*  which has always been a gateway for pilgrims from around the world to the holy sites who then settle sometimes in the province. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1597.44s)]
*  So this sort of coming and going of humanity and of cultures makes the Hejaz much more much more cosmopolitan. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1605.44s)]
*  And the clerics like Abdulaziz bin Baz had wanted to have a Sahwa, an awakening to impose the thinking from the interior of the country on provinces like Hejaz [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1613.44s)]
*  in a much more forceful way. And they had not succeeded until then, until 1979, when, you know, it was it was the door was open to them because the kings, the rulers of Saudi Arabia wanted to protect their throne and needed the clerics on their side. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1626.44s)]
*  So they gave them that that latitude. And so Saudi Arabia changed in in in ways that were not as dramatic as Iran, where all of a sudden alcohol was banned and music was banned. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1641.44s)]
*  Everything turned from white to black, if you will. And so it was a much slower process. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1653.44s)]
*  And I asked a lot of people who lived through that period, did you did you see it happen? Did you try to stop it? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1658.44s)]
*  Did you understand what was going on? And they said, no, because it's the syndrome of the boiling frog. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1664.44s)]
*  The temperature rises very slowly. And before you know it, it's it's too late. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1670.44s)]
*  You know, they thought it was temporary. They thought it would end. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1674.44s)]
*  They thought this couldn't, you know, this would not hold for for long. Same in Lebanon with the rise of Hezbollah. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1678.44s)]
*  You know, a lot of people who supported a resistance movement against Israeli occupation of the south didn't necessarily like Hezbollah's vision for society. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1687.44s)]
*  They thought this is an aberration. And once, you know, the civil war is over and once the Israelis withdraw, Hezbollah will cease to exist. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1698.44s)]
*  It will no longer be there. But Hezbollah stayed and remains a very powerful political force in the country. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1705.44s)]
*  So I think that when you're in the thick of it, it's hard to really understand the trend lines. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1713.44s)]
*  It's hard to understand what you need to do to stop it. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1719.44s)]
*  In Egypt, the rise of intolerance in the 90s when intellectuals thought that just if they wrote more op-eds, more articles, if they raised their voices, their pen would protect them. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1722.44s)]
*  But it didn't. It didn't. And, you know, that retreat and the transformation of Egyptian society is also is also tremendous, which is why I think that or I hope that, you know, my book helps piece together all those pieces of the puzzle to sort of understand exactly how it started [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1732.44s)]
*  and why we got to where we are today and where are the key turning points. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1751.44s)]
*  And perhaps that also helps us in the region, but also for policymakers to find the moments that were that were key that some of them that can be undone or where the road map is to try to retrace some of our steps. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1755.44s)]
*  That's one reason that reviewers have been so positive about this book. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1767.44s)]
*  And if you've looked at the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, other places you've seen, really glowing reviews, is that you've offered a theory of the case. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1771.44s)]
*  You've offered an account of how this broken Middle East were living with, you know, how the modern destruction began. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1783.44s)]
*  And I think that's the power of the book. And I'd urge people to read it with that with that in mind. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1797.44s)]
*  I want to ask you, because we have only less than 10 minutes left to go before we turn it to the audience for your questions, to talk a little bit about the future of the black wave, as you characterize this, this history. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1803.44s)]
*  And I'm going to focus on the two countries that are the central protagonists, Saudi Arabia and Iran. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1819.44s)]
*  So first, Saudi Arabia mentioned MBS in Saudi Arabia. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1827.44s)]
*  And I can remember a dinner with him in Riyadh probably in 2017 before it was as obvious as it became the next after he arrested everybody for this Carlton, but he was really an autocrat. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1833.44s)]
*  And he said, the basic narrative that you described, that Saudi Arabia was not friendly to extreme versions of Wahhabism until 1979 and its reaction internally to the Iranian Revolution, where we began to change. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1855.44s)]
*  And then he turned to me and said, that era is over. And his aides all went, you know, you're right, I still say that. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1878.44s)]
*  And I said to MBS, well, that's the one thing you should say. I mean, that's for goodness sakes, don't try to make that off the record. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1886.44s)]
*  So he said, OK. So you'll find it, you know. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1893.44s)]
*  But that's his that was his claim that this era that you're describing ever more regressive attempts to, you know, devil's bargain with the Ulema, the religious leaders, that era is over. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1898.44s)]
*  So he began to moving to abolish the religious place, the Mutaweem. He began to change some cultural norms. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1915.44s)]
*  So what we learned with the murder of Khashoggi is that he was, if a modernizer, a modernizing autocrat. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1923.44s)]
*  He wasn't all that different from Saddam Hussein and also was a modernizer. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1933.44s)]
*  I'd be very interested in your thoughts about where Saudi Arabia is in terms of the cultural changes that he's tried to encourage. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1939.44s)]
*  Do you think they're popular? Do you think there's going to be a backlash? [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1950.44s)]
*  Do you think young Saudis are so enthusiastic about these changes that they have real momentum? [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1953.44s)]
*  And do you draw any hope from that? Not from MBS, the person, but from this phenomena of cultural change? [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1959.44s)]
*  I do think that the black wave is receding generally in the region. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1967.44s)]
*  I do think that young people don't want to be hostage anymore to the ghosts of 1979. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1971.44s)]
*  Black Wave, the title came from Yousuf Shaheen, the movie director in Egypt, who said there had been a black wave coming from Saudi Arabia and from the Gulf generally to cover women in black with Abaya and the niqab in Egypt. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1977.44s)]
*  Similarly, we had the rise and the spread of the Iranian-style Shia chador in places like Lebanon. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1992.44s)]
*  I think it's too easy for Mohammed bin Salman to say that they reacted to Iran and that before 1979, everything was fine in the kingdom. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=1999.44s)]
*  It wasn't. There was progress. It was a slow march towards more opening up. There was more education for girls. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2012.44s)]
*  There was television. There were women on television without the veil. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2021.44s)]
*  There were a small number of cinemas in cities like Jeddah, but it was a conservative kingdom. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2025.44s)]
*  And the clerics like Abdulaziz bin Baz could call Prince Nayef, Minister of Interior, before 1979 and say, you know, you need to ban Western women from walking around with a cross showing. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2032.44s)]
*  You need to ban foosball. You need to ban this and this and that. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2046.44s)]
*  And they and they responded. The royals responded to these calls before 1979. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2049.44s)]
*  Their efforts to encourage Pakistan to Islamize its its constitution and its laws started before 1979. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2054.44s)]
*  So Saudi Arabia was already trying to export its way of thinking when it comes to religion before 1979. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2064.44s)]
*  So it's too easy to just blame Iran. But it's true that there was a reaction in the Sunni world to what had happened inside the country, inside Iran. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2072.44s)]
*  And that's something that isn't looked at often enough. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2081.44s)]
*  When you read about the Iranian Revolution, you read about it mostly in terms of Iran and how it rippled out to Shia communities. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2085.44s)]
*  But you don't look often at how it rippled out to the Sunni world and how it inspired some people, including in Egypt. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2092.44s)]
*  The assassins of President Sadat were hoping that they too could bring about an Islamic revolution in the country and succeed the same way that Khomeini had had succeeded. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2099.44s)]
*  So it's important to look at that dynamic. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2109.44s)]
*  And that's why I think it's important to look generally at the Saudi Iran rivalry and how they interact and how they feed off each other. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2112.44s)]
*  But when it comes to Mohammed bin Salman and the reforms that are taking place in the country in many ways, I think they are great. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2119.44s)]
*  This is a young population that is thirsty for culture, for advancement, for technology, for music, for theater, for everything. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2127.44s)]
*  But not everyone. And I think that in the words of one of my Saudi friends, what happened in 1979 is that suddenly everything was declared haram. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2138.44s)]
*  And we were brainwashed into accepting only one very specific, one very intolerant version of Islam known as Wahhabism, including in the Hejaz province where people really bristled at this imposition. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2148.44s)]
*  And now suddenly we're being told that everything we heard over the last 40 years was wrong. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2163.44s)]
*  Music is not haram, it's not forbidden. Theater is not haram, it's not forbidden. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2168.44s)]
*  There is an identity crisis going on there. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2172.44s)]
*  People are excited, but people are also troubled. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2176.44s)]
*  And I do think it's possible there will be a backlash because you can only keep the lid on those who oppose such movement for so long. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2180.44s)]
*  You know, you can't keep the lid on for too long. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2191.44s)]
*  So I don't know how the Crown Prince navigates that. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2194.44s)]
*  The only other criticism I would have also is that when it comes to the culture and those advances in the country, you know, opening up of cinemas and ballets and bringing jazz music, a lot of people in Saudi Arabia say, well, we have our own culture. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2198.44s)]
*  Why do we need, you know, wrestlers from America? Why do we need DJs from America? We have our own culture. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2212.44s)]
*  Why are we importing all of this? And in a way, he's doing it precisely what the Shah was doing back in the day when he was sort of imposing Western culture, Western values, Western systems. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2218.44s)]
*  And that did not that did not go well. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2229.44s)]
*  The last thing I will say is that it's fine to reform. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2232.44s)]
*  It is great to try to move your young population forward. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2235.44s)]
*  It is really terrible when women who have campaigned for some of those rights, like the right to drive, end up in jail for having done that. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2239.44s)]
*  I think that's you know, there is something there. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2248.44s)]
*  There is a reputational cost that is that is great. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2250.44s)]
*  Not to, you know, not to mention our colleague, our friend, Jamal Khashoggi. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2253.44s)]
*  Let me ask you briefly, finally, about about Iran. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2258.44s)]
*  If the black wave is receding some in the Sunni world, as you said, it seems to be receding was as well in Iran. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2263.44s)]
*  It's striking how broadly based the protests in Iran are that there seem to be spontaneous rage after the killing of Soleimani led to this terrible disaster of shooting down the Ukrainian plane. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2276.44s)]
*  Young people in the streets, you know, chanting against the supreme leader. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2297.44s)]
*  The movement of women both in Saudi Arabia and Iran is astonishing. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2305.44s)]
*  This woman, Alina Jad, who has character in the book also. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2311.44s)]
*  Wind in my hair is the name of her movement, telling women to take off their veils. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2319.44s)]
*  Feel the wind in your hair. Be free. It's powerful. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2325.44s)]
*  So I just want to ask you just to close with with your own thoughts about about where Iran is going. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2329.44s)]
*  Terribly repressive regime still, obviously. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2336.44s)]
*  But what's your sense of whether change is ahead in Iran? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2340.44s)]
*  I think the Iran is going through a period of continued protests now. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2348.44s)]
*  There doesn't seem to be a beginning and an end to each protest movement. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2354.44s)]
*  So you had 2009 and that was put down. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2358.44s)]
*  And then since 2017, you have recurrent moments of protests. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2361.44s)]
*  2017, 2018, 2019. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2365.44s)]
*  Now, again, at the beginning of this year, it's an ongoing thing. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2368.44s)]
*  But as some of my Carnegie colleagues who are much better experts on Iran than me will tell you, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2372.44s)]
*  is that there is no indication that the regime is about to either fall or give up or reform. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2379.44s)]
*  So I think we're still going to deal with this current form of Iranian government for for a while. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2388.44s)]
*  But again, I don't want to sound like I'm like I don't want to give precise answers or like it's a cop out. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2396.44s)]
*  But I really think that sometimes we don't know when the key turning point happens, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2402.44s)]
*  because in 1978, no one identified that this was really the beginning of the end of the Shah. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2407.44s)]
*  When there was this one moment where the Rex cinema was burned down in Tehran that really galvanized the opposition against the Shah and made it possible. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2415.44s)]
*  And then other elements come into place like Musa Sader disappearing, like Saddam Hussein telling the shah, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2424.44s)]
*  let's should we get rid of of Khomeini or not? [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2431.44s)]
*  And the Shah says, no, all of these different elements make for the constellation, the puzzle that makes a certain event happen. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2434.44s)]
*  And so a lot of people looked at the protests after the downing of the Ukrainian plane earlier this year, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2441.44s)]
*  after the killing of Qasem Soleimani, 170 people died. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2449.44s)]
*  And a lot of people wondered whether this was the Rex cinema moment for Iran and for this for this leadership. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2452.44s)]
*  What I can say is that young people across the region are protesting, continue to protest. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2460.44s)]
*  And increasingly, they're specifically protesting in countries like Iraq and Lebanon. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2467.44s)]
*  They're protesting Iran's stranglehold on their country's politics and resources. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2471.44s)]
*  And I think that is a huge challenge for Iran because Iran doesn't just want to be a powerful country. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2476.44s)]
*  It has ambitions in other countries. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2482.44s)]
*  It tries to export the revolution, has militias in Iraq. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2485.44s)]
*  It has militias in Syria. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2489.44s)]
*  It has Hezbollah in Lebanon, its foothold on the Mediterranean. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2491.44s)]
*  I don't see that power waning for now, but I think the challenge is going to continue and is going to be increasingly strong. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2495.44s)]
*  Unfortunately, the Iranians do not hesitate to use force to put those protests down, whether it's in their own country or Iraq or Lebanon. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2503.44s)]
*  Superb. I'm going to turn to the audience. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2514.44s)]
*  Please identify yourselves briefly, keep your questions short. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2517.44s)]
*  Please make no questions. Yes, sir. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2521.44s)]
*  And there's a mic runner who's going to come and give you a mic. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2524.44s)]
*  I'm Arshad Mohammed. I'm a reporter with Reuters. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2533.44s)]
*  I've traveled with Kim many times covering the State Department. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2536.44s)]
*  Two short questions. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2539.44s)]
*  One, what are your documentary sources for that conversation between Saddam Hussein and the Shah of Iran? [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2541.44s)]
*  Second, can you talk a little bit about you talk about the conservatism, the repression of women in both Saudi Arabia and Iran. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2550.44s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit about what you the extent to which the religious conservatism that one has seen manifested in those societies and others has some resonance within the populations and where that came from? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2561.44s)]
*  Could you repeat the last bit of the second question? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2578.44s)]
*  It seems to me that the religious conservatism in Saudi Arabia, in Iran, in Turkey and other places has had a certain amount of resonance among parts of the populations. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2580.44s)]
*  Explain to us if you can or will where you think that has come from, that desire that sort of millenarian, let's go back to an earlier more conservative vision of Iran, of Islam, excuse me, sort of originates. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2593.44s)]
*  If you look at 1979 and how why it had resonance then, it was because there was the rise of political Islam in the 60s and the early 70s after the defeat of the Arabs and the Arabs really war of 1967, the Six Day War, where even Gamal Abdel Nasser, ostensibly a secular leader, became more prone to talking about God. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2607.44s)]
*  And Anwar Sadat, his successor, was very pious and started using religion to, in essence, appeal to the masses and burnish his own credentials as a leader. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2634.44s)]
*  But Islam was not at the time a force to be reckoned with. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2652.44s)]
*  It was a private exercise. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2657.44s)]
*  You had Islamist parties, you had the Muslim Brotherhood, of course, in Egypt and in Syria, but it wasn't a political force yet. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2659.44s)]
*  And what propelled it forward were the trend lines that developed after 1979. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2666.44s)]
*  Today, I think that after 40 years, the appeal of religion in the Middle East is waning to some extent. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2671.44s)]
*  You have increasing numbers, I think a majority of young Arabs and Muslims who say that religion plays too big a role in their life and they want to see a lesser role, particularly in the politics and in the everyday life. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2679.44s)]
*  You know, it's not an oxymoron to say, or it shouldn't be an oxymoron to say, secular Muslim. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2694.44s)]
*  A lot of the characters in my book through whom I tell the story are devout. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2700.44s)]
*  They pray, they fast, they go to the mosque, but they are very progressive in their outlook on life, on culture, on society, and they believe in the separation of church and state or mosque and state, if you will. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2707.44s)]
*  On your other question about Musa Sader, you know, this was reported in Kai Bird's book, The Good Spy. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2724.44s)]
*  It was also in Andrew Scott Cooper's book, Fall of Heaven, and this is based on their reporting, so this is my secondary source. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2735.44s)]
*  It's based on my reporting and some private conversations in Lebanon as well. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2746.44s)]
*  Yes, we have another question from the audience. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2752.44s)]
*  We answered all the questions. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2759.44s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2761.44s)]
*  And then I see you had all the way back. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2764.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2770.44s)]
*  Most almost every revolution starts with a leader. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2772.44s)]
*  Can you identify, are there potential leaders for change in Iran in particular who are able to survive? [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2776.44s)]
*  That's the key question. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2787.44s)]
*  Within the country, I don't see any that are able to come forward, but very often you don't see them until the last minute. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2790.44s)]
*  You know, a lot of people didn't realize at the time that Khomeini would emerge as the ultimate leader of this movement, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2802.44s)]
*  particularly because, A, he was in exile in Najaf, forgotten in an alley. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2812.44s)]
*  He didn't have exposure to international media and so on, even though he was very popular with his followers. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2818.44s)]
*  But the secular, modernist, leftist, and Islamist modernist activists around them were really at the forefront [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2826.44s)]
*  and thought that they were using him to rally the masses and get people from the mosques out into the street, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2835.44s)]
*  and it ended up that he was, in essence, using them. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2842.44s)]
*  And he had often indicated that all he wanted was to retire under an apple tree in Qom, which ended up not being true. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2846.44s)]
*  But another what-if moment is when Khomeini ends up going to Paris for those last three months of his exile. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2852.44s)]
*  The media exposure he got there was essential in galvanizing the revolution and in giving him the platform [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2859.44s)]
*  to lead this movement to its fruition and to its culmination with his return to Tehran. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2872.44s)]
*  And while doing that, not only did his acolytes push aside people like Musa al-Sadr, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2879.44s)]
*  but then within Iran they're also ruthless in pushing aside other clerics who were a potential challenge to Khomeini. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2887.44s)]
*  And now you see, I mean, within Iran, so many leaders of the Green Movement are still under house arrest. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2894.44s)]
*  Others are, other potential leaders are in exile. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2900.44s)]
*  But you really never know until you're in the middle of it and you see these people emerging, you know, who might be a leader at the crucial time. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2904.44s)]
*  I saw a hand all the way in the back row, I think. Yes, please. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2914.44s)]
*  You can stand and just identify yourself. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2919.44s)]
*  Sure. Hi, my name is Amy Schenck. I'm from IISS Americas. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2921.44s)]
*  I have a quick question about kind of moving forward, looking at the receding of the black wave. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2925.44s)]
*  If you foresee any future collaboration or de-escalation efforts between Saudi and Iran, given the current state in which security issues are arising, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2930.44s)]
*  not necessarily nuclear, but specific JCPOA in the context of the JCPOA, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2940.44s)]
*  but also missile and cyber defense between Saudi Arabia and Iran moving forward, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2946.44s)]
*  if you foresee with this black wave receding any future collaboration or conversation between the two nations? [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2950.44s)]
*  I think there are a lot of efforts for de-escalation whenever there is a rise in tension. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2957.44s)]
*  You know, after the attack against the oil facilities in Abqaiq in Saudi Arabia in September of last year, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2963.44s)]
*  there was a move towards indirect talks between the Saudis and the Iranians through the Iraqis and the Pakistanis. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2971.44s)]
*  So no one really wants a full out war. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2978.44s)]
*  And the Saudis are worried that although President Trump says he's their ally, he doesn't necessarily put his money where his mouth is. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2981.44s)]
*  So there was a lot of heat, a lot of rhetoric after that attack in September, but there was not a lot of fire, if you will. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2991.44s)]
*  There was not a lot of tangible reassurance for the Saudis. There was no action. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=2999.44s)]
*  Eventually, the Americans did send more troops to the region, but the Saudis feel a little bit worried, I would say, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3003.44s)]
*  which is why they're looking for ways to de-escalate. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3010.44s)]
*  And the same cause for de-escalation also happened after Qassem Soleimani was killed, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3014.44s)]
*  because the Saudis, again, didn't want to go to full on war. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3022.44s)]
*  I think it's important to remember that the Saudis and the Iranians have often found their way to detente and rapprochement in the past. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3025.44s)]
*  So it's not impossible going forward. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3032.44s)]
*  In the 90s, there was a flourishing relationship between Khatami and the King of Saudi Arabia. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3035.44s)]
*  They exchanged visits. There were security cooperation agreements. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3041.44s)]
*  What I think makes it difficult now is that Mohammed bin Salman is not necessarily in a compromising mood, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3045.44s)]
*  and he also doesn't trust the Iranians. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3053.44s)]
*  He doesn't trust that detente is used by the Iranians for positive outcomes. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3056.44s)]
*  He feels, and I think he's probably right, that the Iranians use those moments of detente to solidify their position [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3062.44s)]
*  while they're giving all the nice talks and the nice smiles. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3072.44s)]
*  They solidify their position on the ground in the region. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3077.44s)]
*  Mohammed bin Salman feels that the Saudis have been had several times by the Iranians like that. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3081.44s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3087.44s)]
*  I already used the Foundation Middle East Peace. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3096.44s)]
*  Two questions related. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3099.44s)]
*  One, Iraq had been known as the guardian of the Eastern Gate. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3101.44s)]
*  There are much changed circumstances now. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3106.44s)]
*  Are the Saudis making any serious efforts to try to reduce Iranian influence in Iraq, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3109.44s)]
*  which would be a very tough thing to do? [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3117.44s)]
*  And the other thing, are the Saudis looking at certain kinds of cooperation with Israel [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3120.44s)]
*  in the context of their contest, so to speak, or their difficulties with Iran? [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3125.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3132.44s)]
*  The Saudis have tried to make inroads in Iraq to counter Iranian influence there, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3134.44s)]
*  but the Saudis are not very good at managing allies and managing friends. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3140.44s)]
*  They don't have proxy militias the way the Iranians do, so I think it's much harder. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3146.44s)]
*  If you remember, they invited Muqtada al-Sadr, and he went to Riyadh, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3151.44s)]
*  and that was one effort to try to undermine the Iranian role in Iraq, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3156.44s)]
*  but I just don't think they're very good at it. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3161.44s)]
*  They don't manage the chessboard in the same way that the Iranians do. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3164.44s)]
*  Whatever you think of the Iranian policies and the consequences and the devastation [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3168.44s)]
*  that takes place in countries like Syria because of Iranian actions, [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3172.44s)]
*  they're very good at managing the chessboard, [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3178.44s)]
*  and they're very good at keeping their allies close [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3183.44s)]
*  and very good at running their network of proxy militias. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3187.44s)]
*  On the second question, there are, and I think, David, you probably know more about this, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3192.44s)]
*  what's happening behind the scenes between potential talks informally between Saudis and Israelis. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3198.44s)]
*  The Emiratis were in the room when President Trump announced his Middle East peace plan. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3206.44s)]
*  If I'm not mistaken, the Israelis were there. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3212.44s)]
*  There were some talks also in December. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3215.44s)]
*  I think the Gulf countries are mostly concerned, especially Saudi Arabia, [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3217.44s)]
*  are mostly concerned about Iran today, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3222.44s)]
*  and they see Israel as an unspoken ally in that camp. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3225.44s)]
*  So they're also, therefore, very keen to stay on Trump's good side [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3233.44s)]
*  because they want to continue to have the administration put pressure on Iran. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3238.44s)]
*  And so that's also why you'll see them only giving statements [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3245.44s)]
*  rejecting the Middle East peace plan that President Trump put forward, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3249.44s)]
*  but they're not actually going to do anything about it [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3252.44s)]
*  because they want to stay in President Trump's good graces. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3254.44s)]
*  So we have time for one more quick question. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3259.44s)]
*  This gentleman here, and do keep it quick, [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3262.44s)]
*  because I promised we'll wind up in the next minute or so. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3264.44s)]
*  John Abinader, American Task Force for Lebanon. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3268.44s)]
*  Kim, how do you see the Iranian-Saudi relationship playing out in Lebanon? [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3270.44s)]
*  I think the Saudis have â€“ it looks to me like they've given up on Lebanon. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3279.44s)]
*  That's another place where I think they played their cards very badly. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3285.44s)]
*  I think they throw a lot of money around. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3289.44s)]
*  They have a checkbook diplomacy approach that doesn't pay off, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3292.44s)]
*  and then they get very frustrated when their allies don't do what is expected of them. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3296.44s)]
*  The difference between Iran and Saudi Arabia is that groups like Hezbollah [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3302.44s)]
*  or groups like the militias in Iraq really answer to the supreme leader. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3306.44s)]
*  They answer to central command in Iran. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3313.44s)]
*  Saudi allies aren't run like that. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3316.44s)]
*  They don't answer to the king necessarily. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3319.44s)]
*  They may cash a check and they feel some loyalty, [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3322.44s)]
*  but they don't answer to that hierarchy in the same way. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3325.44s)]
*  And I think that the episode where Saad Hariri was forcibly invited to the kingdom in November of 2017 [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3331.44s)]
*  was very damaging to Saudi Arabia's standing in the country. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3341.44s)]
*  And Hezbollah capitalized on that. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3346.44s)]
*  And I think that unfortunately for Lebanon it means that there's going to be continued unrest in the country. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3349.44s)]
*  We're seeing now the protests in Lebanon that continue even though we have a new cabinet. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3358.44s)]
*  But it does look like at the moment Iran and its allies and its friends â€“ [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3364.44s)]
*  and they don't include only Hezbollah but also the president, Mishal Haon â€“ [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3370.44s)]
*  have the upper hand. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3376.44s)]
*  And it's a little bit unclear to me what the Saudis' next move is in Lebanon. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3378.44s)]
*  So with apologies to others who may have questions, I want to bring this to a close. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3383.44s)]
*  Invite everyone to purchase a copy of Kim's superb book. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3391.44s)]
*  And she's going to be signing books that are 30% off. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3397.44s)]
*  You can buy one as a gift for a friend. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3401.44s)]
*  And also ask everybody to join me in thanking Kim for such a good presentation. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXJKOIxQI8I&t=3404.44s)]
