# Sectarianism and Conflict in the Middle East - Regional Cases of Sectarianism
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [November 14, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8)
*  Good morning everyone. I'm Fred Wary. I'm a senior fellow here at the Middle East program [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=0.0s)]
*  at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. It's my pleasure to welcome you to [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  this session on sectarianism and conflict in the Middle East. This event, of course, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=11.84s)]
*  comes in the midst of an especially unsettled time in the region where geopolitical rivalries [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=18.88s)]
*  have conspired with princely ambition and sectarianism to really shake up the region. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=27.0s)]
*  And we're certainly going to have some rich discussions on these current developments [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=34.0s)]
*  in Saudi Arabia, in Lebanon, in Iran by some leading experts. But the point of this session [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=39.2s)]
*  is to really step back and look at some broader dynamics in the region, specifically the role [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=46.4s)]
*  of sectarian identity in fueling instability and conflict in the Middle East. Specifically, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=52.160000000000004s)]
*  we're here to share some important contributions by the authors of a new edited volume, Beyond [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=60.2s)]
*  Sunni and Shia. And here I'll make a shameless plug. The book is on sale outside for, I believe, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=66.52s)]
*  a 50 percent discount. It will be available online in early 2018. Now the chapters that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=73.52s)]
*  you'll encounter in that book and the presentations that you're going to hear today are really [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=81.0s)]
*  the fruits of an intense two-year research effort that was generously funded by the Henry [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  Luce Foundation. Now as some of you may know, the Luce Foundation has a mandate. Its sort [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=93.24s)]
*  of focus is to increase an understanding of religion in international affairs. And so [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=99.08s)]
*  this question of sectarian identity is a highly pertinent one. It's also a highly challenging [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=105.2s)]
*  question, fraught with pitfalls. And it's one, quite frankly, that's been studied quite [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=111.28s)]
*  a bit. And here my feeling is the more the merrier. There's been a number of studies [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=117.44s)]
*  that have come out that I think are really pushing the boundaries about how we think [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=122.14s)]
*  about questions of religious identity in the Middle East to include challenging a lot of [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=128.0s)]
*  the received wisdom. And the book spells out a lot of those theories and the methodology [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=133.84s)]
*  and the debates that we engage with. But let me just say a brief word here about how we [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=139.8s)]
*  define what we were actually looking at in this book. I think all of our authors adopted [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=146.04s)]
*  a definition of sectarianism as a set of beliefs, attitudes, and actions that exclude or demonize [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=152.0s)]
*  a religious other. So this spans the spectrum from soft discrimination all the way to some [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=160.0s)]
*  of the horrific massacres we see being committed by the Islamic State. Now in framing sectarianism, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=166.0s)]
*  I think we saw great value in a comparative approach. And indeed one of our authors is [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=173.0s)]
*  actually a scholar of conflict resolution in Northern Ireland. And though the book, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=178.0s)]
*  as the title suggests, focuses on the Sunni-Shia split, we of course acknowledge a number [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=184.28s)]
*  of other intra-Islamic divisions, specifically within Sunni Islam, as well as differences [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=191.3s)]
*  between Muslims and other religious faiths in the region. I think when we started our [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=197.7s)]
*  study back in 2015, all of our scholars acknowledged the limitations of looking at the region through [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=204.82s)]
*  a religious lens. In particular, I think we rejected what can be called the sort of primordialist [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=212.82s)]
*  school of thought. And this is sort of a deterministic view that sees the Middle East, the tensions [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=219.5s)]
*  in the Middle East today, as a continuation of an age-old conflict in Islam, within Islam, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=224.98s)]
*  within the Sunni and Shia branches of Islam. This notion that the conflict is preordained, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=231.74s)]
*  it's immutable, the sort of ancient hatreds school of thought. Now to be sure, there are [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=237.58s)]
*  important divides between the two sects over questions of religious and political authority, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=242.78s)]
*  rituals, jurisprudence, and other matters. But this notion of these two blocks that are [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=247.22000000000003s)]
*  locked in conflict in the Middle East, I think is patently false. And it's a notion that's [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=254.22000000000003s)]
*  been rejected by most serious scholars today. But unfortunately, I think it still exists [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=258.90000000000003s)]
*  as an explanation, as a sort of lazy explanation in the media, and unfortunately in policy [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=265.9s)]
*  circles as well. And I think at the other end of the spectrum is this notion of religion, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=270.34s)]
*  an interpretation of religion using an excessively materialist or instrumentalist approach. This [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=277.7s)]
*  notion that sectarianism is top-down, that it's really a reflection of economic and political [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=284.29999999999995s)]
*  grievances or elite manipulation. Of course, we acknowledge that this is in play, and I [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=289.96s)]
*  think a lot of scholars tilt toward this school of thought, this notion that sectarianism [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=296.59999999999997s)]
*  in the Middle East is a product of authoritarianism, the lack of pluralistic governance, that elites [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=300.64s)]
*  in the region have an interest in playing divide and rule, of organizing their politics [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=307.35999999999996s)]
*  along sectarian lines to prevent challenges to their rule. And certainly, you know, this [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  plays a role. We see this, of course, in the pronouncements of clerics. We see it in the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=318.32s)]
*  foreign policies of a number of states. But I think these explanations have their limitations [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=323.8s)]
*  as well. Belief, identity, principles, doctrines do in fact matter to quite a number of people [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=328.56s)]
*  in the region. So we try to steer a sort of middle path between these two poles. And I [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=337.92s)]
*  think this middle path is really reflected in the backgrounds of the scholars that contributed. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=343.24s)]
*  We have political scientists, we have sociologists, journalists, even a criminologist who looked [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  at sectarianism in policing sectors. We have scholars who use incredible data-driven coding [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=353.56s)]
*  and surveys. And we have sort of classically trained historians of Islam and scholars of [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=360.64000000000004s)]
*  theology who focus on the primary text. The topics, as you'll see from the panel and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=365.0s)]
*  also the chapters, are country-based and geographic, but they're also thematic. And that's the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=371.36s)]
*  way we've divided the two panels today. The first panel, which I'll moderate, will cover [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=377.64s)]
*  how sectarianism factors into the foreign policies and internal politics of a number [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=383.44s)]
*  of pivotal states in the region. To include Saudi Arabia, its relationship with Iran and [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=389.2s)]
*  the Islamic State, the role of sectarianism in Iranian foreign policy, the sectarianization [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=395.0s)]
*  of Syria's civil war, and of course sectarianism in contemporary Iraq, which is an especially [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=400.40000000000003s)]
*  important issue given the common notion that the 2003 invasion of that country by the U.S. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=408.24s)]
*  sort of triggered this sectarian explosion in the region. So having surveyed the region, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=413.64s)]
*  the second panel will drill down into some thematic and structural topics. How do institutions [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=420.2s)]
*  in the region affect sectarianism? How does governance and even technology affect the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=426.20000000000005s)]
*  diffusion and transformation of sectarianism? And here we'll hear from some highly original [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=431.76000000000005s)]
*  research by Justin Gangler on political economy, Alex Siegel on the role of social media, Joe [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=437.20000000000005s)]
*  Bahut will look at sect-based power sharing in Lebanon, the Taf agreement, how well has [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=444.20000000000005s)]
*  that held up given recent developments, and of course Alex Henley will examine the role [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=449.96s)]
*  of clerics in both fueling and tempering sectarianism. I'll add that the speaker lineup does not [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=456.52s)]
*  reflect the complete author list. We've also got some great chapters on Egypt, on the Islamic [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=465.35999999999996s)]
*  State, on Bahrain, and then a comparative chapter looking at Northern Ireland. So with that [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=472.15999999999997s)]
*  I won't waste any more time. We'll get started right on the first panel. And I'd like to [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=478.28000000000003s)]
*  start off with a country that's on everyone's minds, that has such an important influence [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=482.6s)]
*  in the region, and that is often sort of blamed for stoking sectarianism, especially in the [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=488.28000000000003s)]
*  Arab world, Iran. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=493.76s)]
*  Well, thank you. Thank you for having me. So my chapter is on the sectarian dilemma [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=495.56s)]
*  in Iranian foreign policy. And broadly I frame this as is Iran a sectarian actor? If so, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=502.2s)]
*  how, who sees it as such? And really who sees Iran as a sectarian actor is its neighbors. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=508.96s)]
*  Its neighbors see it as a far more problematic actor. So is Iran sectarian foreign policy, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=516.84s)]
*  or is Iran foreign policy sectarian sort of in general? I would say broadly no, it's not. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=527.34s)]
*  And you can look at a number of reasons why this is. Iran's relationship with India, Iran's [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=535.1s)]
*  relationship with China, Iran's relationship with Venezuela, with Armenia. There's lots [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=540.5400000000001s)]
*  of examples of how Iran is not a sectarian actor, not in the pan-Islamic sense and not [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=544.76s)]
*  in the pro-Shi'a sense, which is sort of the more narrow angle that my chapter looks at. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=549.94s)]
*  So if it's not sort of a broadly a foreign policy sort of consideration for Iran to be [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=555.2s)]
*  sectarian driven, then where does it lie? Where is this sectarian element coming from? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=561.86s)]
*  And it comes largely from Iran's behavior in the region. But what I would say what Iran's [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=568.34s)]
*  behavior in the region and its broader aims in terms of foreign policy share is an element [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=574.3000000000001s)]
*  of self-interest. That Iran's foreign policy is driven by self-interest, it's driven by [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=580.26s)]
*  geopolitical challenges, it's driven by strategic interests. And these are really sort of the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=584.16s)]
*  true Norths, I think, for Iran's foreign policy, broadly speaking. But obviously there's [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=589.06s)]
*  a problem. And that problem resides on the perception of Iran's foreign policy and its [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=595.14s)]
*  behavior more particularly in the region. And I think Iran's behavior in the region [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=600.8199999999999s)]
*  is a little more identifiable as such as sectarian. You can only, you can easily sort of look at [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=607.6199999999999s)]
*  the landscape of who Iran's friends are, which countries it's involved in, and who [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=614.62s)]
*  it does its business with in the Middle East to realize that there's a sectarian sort of [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=620.92s)]
*  divide in terms of who its friends tend to be and who its friends tend not to be. And [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=625.92s)]
*  I'll get sort of a little more into that briefly. I'm going to keep this short just in general. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=630.18s)]
*  Hopefully we can have a lot of discussion from the audience. I think there's a lot going [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=635.4s)]
*  on in this sort of generally speaking regarding sort of Iran and the Middle East. And I should [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=639.7s)]
*  say sort of outright that the way that I frame this chapter is within Iran's conflict with [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=649.6600000000001s)]
*  its neighbors, sometimes sort of boiled down to the Iran-Saudi conflict or the Iran-Saudi [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=655.58s)]
*  tensions. I see them as a little more broadly than just Iran-Saudi. That's really sort of [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=660.1800000000001s)]
*  what I root this paper in. So what is the basis of Iranian sort of sectarianism, the [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=664.94s)]
*  perception of Iranian sectarianism? I think there are structural and contextual reasons [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=670.22s)]
*  for this. First and foremost, you have 500 years of history where Iran has been a primarily [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=674.18s)]
*  Shia state surrounded by primarily Sunni neighbors. This is a dynamic that has existed, like I [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=680.06s)]
*  said, for half a millennia. And it's hardened the identities of all of those countries that [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=687.42s)]
*  perceive Iran in one way and Iran perceives its neighbors in another way. This is not [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=693.74s)]
*  sort of a primordial argument. This is just a state of fact that Iran has been seen as [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=698.1s)]
*  a Shia country. And that's to say it sees itself as a primarily Shia country and its [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=703.1400000000001s)]
*  neighbors are different for the most part. The second is a regional geopolitical angle. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=707.94s)]
*  And this really starts with the 1979 revolution. The Islamic revolution obviously brings, whether [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=713.9000000000001s)]
*  you're familiar with Iran or not, brings to power in Iran a theocracy that's governed [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=720.18s)]
*  by Shia clergy. They're driven by an ideology that is framed within a pan-Islamist agenda [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=728.2199999999999s)]
*  but is articulated through a very undeniably sort of Shia language. And this is something [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=735.3s)]
*  that challenged its neighbors right after 1979 and the rest of Iranian sort of political [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=744.3s)]
*  changes after 1979 also challenged its neighbors. It was anti-monarchical. If you go right across [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=749.18s)]
*  the Gulf, you have monarchies that still exist to this day. That was an inherent challenge. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=755.18s)]
*  It was revolutionary. Revolutions are inherently challenging to the status quo. So for all [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=759.3s)]
*  of these reasons, Iran was seen as a challenge after 1979. But the theocracy of Iran made [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=764.7399999999999s)]
*  this challenge not just political or ideological but also gave a religious tinge to all of [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=770.9799999999999s)]
*  Iran's behavior. After 1979, because of this and because of some actions that Iran and [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=776.38s)]
*  its neighbors made, Iran became quite isolated. You have the Iran-Iraq War, which starts less [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=784.18s)]
*  than two years after the 1979 revolution, lasts for eight years after that. And during [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=790.1s)]
*  that war, fear of Iran's religious ideology spreading beyond Iran's borders into Iraq, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=795.66s)]
*  changing the nature of Iraq, galvanized the neighborhood, as I call the Middle East, against [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=802.86s)]
*  Iran. So people bankrolled Saddam Hussein's fight against Iran. They also supported them [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=811.66s)]
*  politically. And throughout the 1980s, Iran frankly had no friends. Syria was a mild friend. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=817.86s)]
*  Libya, Muammar, Gaddafi was a mild friend. It was able to buy weapons from places like [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=824.2199999999999s)]
*  North Korea. But it really had no allies. So after the conclusion of the Iran-Iraq War [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=829.34s)]
*  entered the 90s, Iran is a pretty isolated country that realizes it has no real friends. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=837.82s)]
*  It has no friends in the region. And because of its sort of ideological and political goals, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=844.02s)]
*  it's difficult for it to make friends very easily, or at least close friends. So what [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=850.38s)]
*  Iran started to begin to concentrate on was the development of friends that were sort [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=856.38s)]
*  of below the state level. It had difficulty sort of creating friends at the state level. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=862.9s)]
*  So below the state, they could find constituencies that were either alienated or within conflict [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=867.78s)]
*  zones or that wanted assistance from a foreign power but weren't getting any of that assistance. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=873.42s)]
*  And Iran played that role. They had already during the 1980s developed important clients [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=879.0999999999999s)]
*  like Lebanese Hezbollah or Iraqi groups like the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=884.06s)]
*  in Iraq, the Sqiri, or the Bader Organization. Those groups became meaningful later on. But [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=889.54s)]
*  they were a way of Iran finding constituencies, finding groups that would sort of be on board [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=895.86s)]
*  with Iran's agenda but also willing to do business with Iran. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=902.06s)]
*  So suffice it to say that the majority of these friends that Iran was able to make through [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=909.18s)]
*  the 1990s and even into the 2000s, particularly after the toppling of Saddam Hussein in 2003, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=914.38s)]
*  tended to be Shiites. They reached out to Sunni as well. And some Sunni groups they [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=920.8599999999999s)]
*  were able to become friends with. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad are two good examples [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=924.6999999999999s)]
*  of Palestinian groups. Iran also tried hard in the mid-90s to make friends with Bosnian [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=929.8199999999999s)]
*  groups. But those Bosnian groups ended up becoming better friends with countries that [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=935.58s)]
*  had more money and less strings attached than Iran. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=940.1s)]
*  So enter the Arab Spring 2011. Most of Iran's friends, most of its allies in the region [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=943.74s)]
*  are not states but rather below the state level. Iraq is now an exception after Saddam [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=951.78s)]
*  Hussein. It is a friendly country. And it was able to become a friend of Iran through [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=956.78s)]
*  a two-fold foreign policy approach. One was what you would call a legitimate or traditional [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=962.94s)]
*  foreign policy approach, which is state to state investment, commercial activities, diplomacy, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=970.26s)]
*  that sort of thing. But also there was a below the state activity. And this was the funding [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=975.34s)]
*  of Militant Group that targeted U.S. forces and helped drive U.S. forces out in 2011 that [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=980.5s)]
*  became part of the political conversation after 2011. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=986.3s)]
*  So Iran entered the Arab Spring, now has a new region to deal with. That new region now [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=990.3s)]
*  has these conflicts or uprisings that exist in places like Bahrain or Syria or Yemen that [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=997.9s)]
*  all have a sectarian tinge to them. They are disgruntled or discontent communities that [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1005.4599999999999s)]
*  are rising against or protesting their ruling regimes. And they just happen to have a sectarian [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1010.78s)]
*  divide between those two sides. So Iran's interest in those areas, Syria in particular, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1017.1s)]
*  but Bahrain and Yemen as well, made it a natural ally for those people that were rebelling [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1023.78s)]
*  against the status quo. Or in two of those countries were rebelling against the status [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1029.22s)]
*  quo. And then in Syria it was against the rebels against the status quo. So Iran becomes [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1033.54s)]
*  involved in all of those conflicts either sort of primarily rhetorically in the case [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1038.8999999999999s)]
*  of Bahrain or literally in terms of military efforts and support in the cases of Syria [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1045.8999999999999s)]
*  and in Bahrain. And then when you have the rise of ISIS, obviously things change and [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1053.58s)]
*  Iran becomes much more involved in Iraq and an overt side as well. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1058.5s)]
*  So after the Arab Spring you really have sectarianism grow as an issue not just because of what [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1063.54s)]
*  Iran is doing but just regionally it's become much more of an issue. And Iran's activities [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1070.1s)]
*  become very difficult to contain in terms of their sectarian dynamics. So for instance [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1075.86s)]
*  if you look at all Iran's allies and all of the conflicts going on in Yemen, Iraq and [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1082.86s)]
*  Syria for the most part they are entirely Shiite. If you look at the way that they articulate [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1090.2199999999998s)]
*  their adversaries or their enemies either sort of broadly or directly they are all for [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1094.6599999999999s)]
*  the most part Sunnis. Saudi Arabia, UAE, the Syrian rebels, ISIS of course but that's [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1100.78s)]
*  an easy one and not a hard sell for Iran. But it changes things right. It also changes [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1107.78s)]
*  from Iran's perspective the nature of the conflict right. The Arab Spring and particularly [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1114.42s)]
*  the rise of ISIS changed sort of what Iran was doing in a sense of making it maybe somewhat [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1119.8600000000001s)]
*  illegitimate in the eyes of its own people but also in terms of how it was seen internationally [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1125.78s)]
*  to something that was seen as a little more legitimate at least in Syria and in Iraq right. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1131.38s)]
*  They're fighting ISIS and ISIS being a hyper anti-Shiite organization that was killing [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1137.7s)]
*  Shia by the thousands. Suddenly there was a reason for Iran's involvement to be pro-Shiite [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1142.94s)]
*  to help sort of define a Shia resistance against these groups. So more broadly speaking the [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1148.98s)]
*  difficulty for Iran's support to these groups is not just that it supports them politically [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1161.5800000000002s)]
*  but it's also the language that they use to describe these events. So at the top level [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1166.3s)]
*  of Iranian government all of the official statements are non-sectarian and they're [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1171.3999999999999s)]
*  very consistent about this point and they have been for the most part since 1979. Iranian [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1176.3999999999999s)]
*  or Khomeiniist ideology in the Islamic Republic is pan-Islamic. They want Sunni friends just [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1183.52s)]
*  as much as they want Shia friends and in fact they always hold up their Sunni friends like [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1189.52s)]
*  Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad as examples of how they are not sectarian right. This [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1194.24s)]
*  is sort of I can't be sectarian because I have minority friends too. We have American [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1199.84s)]
*  equivalents of the same thing. And so in some ways it's just as shallow a sort of retort [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1205.48s)]
*  from a regional perspective as it seems but for Iran it's a very sincere thing. They believe [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1214.04s)]
*  in spreading that sort of support across sectarian sides but the problem is that the main element [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1221.04s)]
*  that does this activity outside of Iran the IRGC Iran's primary military organization. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1226.48s)]
*  The way they describe these conflicts is completely sectarian not to the sense that it's anti-Sunni [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1233.88s)]
*  but to the sense that it's completely intertwined with Shia identity and about Shia identity [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1239.96s)]
*  and about protecting Shia identity. And not only that it's not only communal it's also [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1246.56s)]
*  religious. They describe their efforts in Syria or their efforts in Saudi Arabia as [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1252.8s)]
*  defending the Shia shrines in those countries and those shrines are a metaphor for defending [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1259.0s)]
*  the Shia religion. They talk about their network of allies of these militant groups primarily [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1264.9199999999998s)]
*  from Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and even into Yemen as a transnational Shia army where they have [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1273.24s)]
*  made that point. They've walked that point back and now just call it the transnational [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1280.6s)]
*  Muslim army. But the point is there they wear it on their sleeve and this is not in any [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1283.6s)]
*  way lost by Iran's neighbors. So Iran in some sense kind of wants to play the part of the [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1290.16s)]
*  pan-Islamist sort of actor in the region but really when it comes down to their actual [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1296.76s)]
*  behavior whether it's structural or whatever the roots are it comes off as very one sided. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1303.44s)]
*  Now the other side of this is that post 2011 you can even say before 2011 Iran's neighbors [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1312.04s)]
*  are engaging in the exact same thing in a different way but in the exact same thing. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1319.52s)]
*  All of their allies are Sunnis. You don't see Saudi Arabia or the Emirates or Jordan [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1324.48s)]
*  or even Turkey reach out or try to build Shia constituencies or support Shia constituencies. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1330.1s)]
*  So in a sense Iran has no competition within the Shia realm at least at the grassroots [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1335.86s)]
*  level at the top political level there's sort of some differences. So the way that I see [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1343.02s)]
*  it is sort of to conclude this is that Iran's sectarian or Iran's foreign policy at its [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1350.2s)]
*  roots is not sectarian. Iran's goals what they're trying to achieve you can say at [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1355.8s)]
*  best is pan-Islamic if not is just completely driven by self interest but their behavior [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1361.12s)]
*  in the Middle East is inherently sectarian and perhaps increasingly so. And so the way [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1366.52s)]
*  that I see it is the more sectarian that politics has become especially conflicts in the Middle [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1374.68s)]
*  East have become the more sectarian Iran's behavior has become and this is sort of a [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1382.68s)]
*  chicken and egg sort of concept but I really think that the two are connected. So were [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1389.04s)]
*  sectarianism to decrease I would expect Iranian sectarianism to also decrease but that is [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1395.6000000000001s)]
*  sort of a long way down the road I think. I'll sort of leave it there. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1403.44s)]
*  Moving across the Gulf. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1408.32s)]
*  Okay so my what I've been asked to talk about is primarily ISIS in Saudi Arabia and ISIS [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1412.24s)]
*  and Saudi Arabia and perhaps even Saudi foreign policy. I should just caveat that by saying [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1420.6s)]
*  I'm a historian who looks primarily at history of Saudi Arabia history of religion in Saudi [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1428.84s)]
*  Arabia and I also follow the Jihadi movements in the modern Middle East very carefully. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1435.32s)]
*  So that's the lens that I'm coming from to this and what's interesting to me though [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1440.3999999999999s)]
*  in looking at this subject right now is that it's a reflection of just how fast things [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1447.68s)]
*  are moving in Saudi Arabia these days that was a year and a half ago everybody was talking [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1451.8799999999999s)]
*  about ISIS in Saudi Arabia not the detention of princes and ministers in the Ritz Carlton. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1456.32s)]
*  So we've really seen a great development in the news cycle and then what is a perceived [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1464.04s)]
*  threat or story in this country. So bottom line up front will be that the Islamic State [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1472.08s)]
*  does not represent a kind of imminent existential threat to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia but [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1479.4399999999998s)]
*  it will probably be a persistent one for a few reasons. So let me run through what [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1486.44s)]
*  has happened with regard to ISIS and the Islamic State as you all know in mid 2014 [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1493.44s)]
*  Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi proclaimed the caliphate and soon after that he announced the extension [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1501.88s)]
*  or the expansion of the caliphate to a number of other quote unquote provinces. One of those [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1509.88s)]
*  provinces so designated was the Arabian Peninsula. They never call it Saudi Arabia because the [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1514.88s)]
*  word Saudi is the name comes from the name of the Saudi royal family so they would never [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1522.88s)]
*  refer to them as Saudis. They call them the El Salud which instead of the El Salud they [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1528.88s)]
*  refer to an early opponent of the prophet. It's kind of an inside baseball there but [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1535.88s)]
*  there you have it. So in November 2014 when Baghdadi announced the establishment of an [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1548.7600000000002s)]
*  official presence in Saudi Arabia he outlined a strategy there for pursuing the organization's [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1555.8400000000001s)]
*  objectives and strategy was as follows. First attack the Shia which was interesting because [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1561.76s)]
*  that meant he wanted to focus the efforts of the Islamic State on stoking a kind of [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1568.92s)]
*  sectarian civil war in Saudi Arabia a la the Iraq war after 2003. So after going after [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1573.72s)]
*  the Shia he said then go after the Saudi security forces and then third go after westerners [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1582.8799999999999s)]
*  and western interests which is a script that the Islamic State would indeed follow in Saudi [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1590.2s)]
*  Arabia over the next couple of years and even until the present. It really hasn't attacked [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1597.72s)]
*  westerners except in maybe one exceptional case which is interesting because it's exactly [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1604.8400000000001s)]
*  the opposite approach that was taken by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula back when it [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1611.3000000000002s)]
*  was staging a small insurgency in Saudi Arabia back in 2003. Their focus was to go after [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1618.1s)]
*  westerners and then go after the security forces and if you have time go after the Shia. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1624.98s)]
*  So you have a completely different strategy which is totally sectarian and over the course [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1630.3s)]
*  of a couple of years the Islamic State announced that it had three provinces in Saudi Arabia. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1639.3799999999999s)]
*  Of course they didn't hold any territory in these provinces but they had the province [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1645.66s)]
*  they said of Bahrain. Bahrain is an old Arabic term meaning eastern Arabia and they had the [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1651.5400000000002s)]
*  province of Nejd which is central Arabia where the capital Riyadh is and they had the western [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1658.78s)]
*  province or the province of the Hijaz. So when they issued, when they had attacks they were [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1665.18s)]
*  proclaimed in the name of these different provinces and for a while there seemed to [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1672.78s)]
*  be actually a lot of momentum on the side of these attacks. There were mostly suicide [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1678.3s)]
*  bombings and shootings at Shia shrines and mosques in the eastern province at mosques [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1682.38s)]
*  that were dedicated for the Saudi security forces and they killed a lot of people. Their [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1689.74s)]
*  greatest attack was actually in Kuwait city. It had about 200 casualties. This was about [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1697.74s)]
*  two years ago. But things did not continue in this vein. But at the height, just to go [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1703.66s)]
*  back, in May 2016 the Saudi press reported that the country was seeing one ISIS attack [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1712.06s)]
*  every 12 days which was quite a lot. But things changed rather quickly and the Saudi government [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1719.66s)]
*  did not respond. So it seems to be that they basically arrested a lot of the people. They [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1726.74s)]
*  were able to penetrate a lot of the cells and as soon as they did that and as soon as [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1734.34s)]
*  ISIS in Iraq and Syria started not to maybe be as attractive, not as inspiring, the number [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1738.82s)]
*  of attacks went down very significantly. And so really all you read about today when you [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1746.66s)]
*  read about ISIS in Saudi Arabia is how the security forces have staged a raid on an ISIS [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1751.5s)]
*  holdout or stronghold and they've killed those people. And just two weeks ago there was one [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1760.5s)]
*  of these outside Riyadh where a guy who was being arrested detonated his suicide belt. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1766.3s)]
*  But in any event, the government is certainly by no means worried about the threat of the [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1772.62s)]
*  Islamic State to its hold on power. So the other dimension in which the Islamic State [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1780.62s)]
*  is kind of attacking Saudi Arabia is conceptual. So the Jihadi Salafi movement to which both [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1787.62s)]
*  Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State belong is a blend of different Islamic influences. But [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1796.34s)]
*  the one that is dominant in the Islamic State is actually Wahhabism, a kind of modern reading, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1804.34s)]
*  politicized reading of Wahhabism. Wahhabism being the revivalist and intolerant puritanical [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1813.1399999999999s)]
*  revivalist movement that begins in Saudi Arabia in the mid-18th century. So they see themselves, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1819.26s)]
*  ISIS the way that they portray themselves, they are an extension of this mission on behalf [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1826.3s)]
*  of monotheism and this war against the forces of what they call polytheism and unbelief, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1832.02s)]
*  a mission that was started by Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab in the mid-1740s. And they deployed [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1840.9s)]
*  this narrative in particular in the context of Saudi Arabia because they're trying to [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1848.78s)]
*  challenge the modern Saudi State for the right to say that we are the heirs of this tradition. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1853.1399999999999s)]
*  So when you read their propaganda or you listen to the speeches of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, there [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1861.14s)]
*  are lots of small references where they say, oh you in Saudi Arabia, oh you people of Tauheed, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1867.14s)]
*  oh you people of Al-Wala, Al-Bara, these are references to Wahhabi theological principles [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1873.7800000000002s)]
*  and they're trying to shame good Wahhabi Muslims in Saudi Arabia into thinking that [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1879.46s)]
*  they're not supporting monotheism the way that they ought to. And what's interesting [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1886.6200000000001s)]
*  about this is that it comes at a time when the Saudi State under Crown Prince Muhammad [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1892.3s)]
*  bin Salman is really trying to distance himself from what he calls the opposite of moderate [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1901.02s)]
*  Islam. So you have a situation where a jihadi movement is increasingly adopting the religious [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1906.54s)]
*  heritage of Wahhabism while the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is kind of trying to get rid [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1913.94s)]
*  of or at least suppress the more militant and intolerant portions of Wahhabism in its [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1920.54s)]
*  country. So you'll see this contest for power and it features a lot in the propaganda. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1930.1399999999999s)]
*  Just as a kind of vignette about this, so the former mufti of the Islamic State was [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1937.8200000000002s)]
*  a man named Turki al-Binali. He had studied actually in Saudi Arabia in the mid 2000s [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1947.5s)]
*  under one of the leading scholarly authorities for Wahhabism in the Kingdom, a guy named [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1954.5400000000002s)]
*  Abdullah ibn Jibrin. And when Abdullah ibn Jibrin died in 2009, he received a phone [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1961.54s)]
*  call from the then governor of Riyadh who is now King Salman. King Salman called him [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1968.18s)]
*  and, or not called him, he called his family, excuse me. And this is a custom, but the thing [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1973.94s)]
*  is this was a particularly harsh cleric. If you think Ibn Bez was tough, this man believed [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1980.02s)]
*  that all the Shia needed to be killed as he said, that there was no excuse for being [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1986.02s)]
*  Shiite. In Turkey it's probably a more intense anti-Shiite kind of statement than Turki al-Binali [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1990.74s)]
*  himself held. So just a couple days later after you had that statement from the king, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=1998.82s)]
*  the man who would become the mufti of ISIS also gave a eulogy for the same scholar. I [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2007.06s)]
*  don't think going into the future that we're going to see that kind of situation where [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2013.3s)]
*  the mufti of ISIS and the king of Saudi Arabia are paying homage to the same Salafi scholar. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2019.7s)]
*  We're moving in a different direction and it'll be interesting to see. I think that [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2025.42s)]
*  they've, a lot of the Saudi response so far in the media has been to describe all of its [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2029.94s)]
*  enemies as kind of associated with Qatar and the Muslim Brotherhood. In the case of ISIS, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2037.94s)]
*  I don't think either of those claims is true. There hasn't really been a kind of reassessment [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2044.46s)]
*  of the role that Wahhabism plays in stimulating these ideologies. I'm not sure that there [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2050.62s)]
*  actually will be. I think it will be done more quietly though, that is the kind of getting [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2057.82s)]
*  past Wahhabism. Am I wired? Am I audible? Yes, you are. So Fred, you have thankfully [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2063.42s)]
*  taken away a bit from what I wanted to say by referring to the premodulus and instrumentalist [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2081.1s)]
*  approach to sectarianism. And we look at Syria, the Syrian case, that is reflected I would [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2089.1s)]
*  say in two narratives concerning the conflict. We have the narrative, what you describe as [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2098.8199999999997s)]
*  lazy scholarship or lazy politics or journalism, which basically holds that this is again one [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2106.22s)]
*  conflict between two irreconcilable religious communities, which in this discourse are really [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2113.22s)]
*  treated as nations. Nations in and of themselves, they are like political collectives and they [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2123.2999999999997s)]
*  are struggling for the states or they are maybe struggling for new states. And you have [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2130.2999999999997s)]
*  a series of scholars like Joshua Landis for instance, who actually go and say, well let's [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2133.98s)]
*  redraw the map and make a state for the Sunnis and Shia. Exaggerating a bit what he was saying, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2140.42s)]
*  but only a bit. And of course as social scientists this is not where we want to be, in particular [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2148.98s)]
*  since it omits the role of state power, it omits the role of authoritarianism as you [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2154.6200000000003s)]
*  said in creating these identities and exploiting them. And of course it's a narrative that [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2161.94s)]
*  is very hostile to difference. So they can only be one people, so hence they can only [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2167.54s)]
*  be one belief in the community according to this narrative. So we would gravitate towards [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2176.06s)]
*  the other narratives that in the Syrian context holds as an evil dictator who is using sectarianism [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2181.7799999999997s)]
*  as a strategy of divide and rule. Basically lacking legitimacy, faced with opposition, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2189.78s)]
*  this evil dictator and his evil crew strategically manipulate sectarianism to bring the people [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2197.94s)]
*  to their sides and to create an other that then can be fought and destroyed as terrorists, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2206.5s)]
*  Islamists, what have you. Now I also unfortunately I'm a bit uncomfortable with that narrative [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2211.98s)]
*  too. And the idea that you have these brave young activists who I have a lot of sympathy [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2219.34s)]
*  with who basically create this counter narrative, this counter vision if you want of Syrian [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2231.42s)]
*  society as one that is civic, that goes beyond, unites people beyond those divisive identities [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2238.94s)]
*  into one collective on the liberal base of individual citizenship. And the idea that [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2247.98s)]
*  these people only got marginalized as a result of violence. Once violence starts of course [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2255.2200000000003s)]
*  you have to bring out the thugs on both sides, you need the people who know how to use guns [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2262.62s)]
*  and who know how to hit in the streets and those are not going to be the nice liberal [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2266.7s)]
*  people who propose the other idea. And of course we had a narrative of foreign influence [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2270.7s)]
*  that pushed it into this direction from both ends, from Iran and from Saudi Arabia, depending [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2279.1s)]
*  from which political angle you look at the scenery. What makes me a bit uncomfortable [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2286.3799999999997s)]
*  with this narrative is two things. One is the observation that the Syrian regime before [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2294.38s)]
*  2011 certainly functioned by the principle of divide and rule. But the ways it divided [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2304.38s)]
*  society in order to rule used many different devices and used many different strategies [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2311.82s)]
*  and many different identities also and sectarianism or sectarian identity was only one of them. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2318.94s)]
*  And for instance local identities, class solidarity, class interest, simply material interest, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2325.7000000000003s)]
*  all of these were equally used and played against each other and played to create a [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2333.5s)]
*  polity that could be ruled by this dictator at the top where all power would coalesce. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2340.94s)]
*  And the second observation that makes me uncomfortable with this narrative is that if you look at [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2349.1400000000003s)]
*  the very early stage of the uprising, so March 2011, April 2011, we know what happened, we [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2358.1000000000004s)]
*  realize that sectarian incidences, if you want to call them that, violence that is clearly [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2367.7000000000003s)]
*  meant to either look sectarian, create impression that it's motivated by sectarianism or is [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2374.34s)]
*  motivated by sectarianism, you have that at a very early stage, at a stage well before [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2380.6600000000003s)]
*  foreign influence really became overwhelming. And I would posit here that, now I'm getting [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2388.7000000000003s)]
*  even more uncomfortable, closer to the primordialist, I would posit that Syrian society in 2011 [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2396.7s)]
*  or before 2011 was primed for sectarianism, was primed for such a reaction and that it [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2405.22s)]
*  would have required very conscious, responsible political leadership to avoid it, to avoid [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2413.14s)]
*  that outcome. And that in the absence of such leadership and of course when we talk about [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2421.14s)]
*  the regime with the tendency to actually condone this kind of development, this development [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2427.06s)]
*  was unavoidable, was unavoidable despite the best of the efforts of those great activists. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2434.54s)]
*  So why is that so? I mean why was Syria in 2011 primed for sectarianism? Not of course, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2442.2599999999998s)]
*  I hope I don't need to say that again but I still do, because of this age old never [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2449.54s)]
*  to be bridge, never to be reconciled conflict between the two or several religious groups, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2454.46s)]
*  if we really consider the Alawis to be Shia which we can be debated. Not because of this [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2461.14s)]
*  but because of the history, the very recent history of perhaps two decades before the [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2466.7s)]
*  uprising, two, three decades before the uprising. And I point out three elements here or three [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2473.86s)]
*  factors let's say that are generative I think of sectarianization, of making sect or sectarian [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2481.22s)]
*  identification a very crucial way for Syrians to be able to have a very strong political [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2489.5s)]
*  power to interpret and to organize their society around them, social processes around them, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2496.7s)]
*  things that happen to them or their relatives, things that structure their life. One, the [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2503.94s)]
*  first aspect is the legacy of violence. So we had, this is unfortunately under reported [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2509.94s)]
*  in the discussions about the conflict, we had a conflict along similar lines roughly [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2516.94s)]
*  20 years before, 30 years before. Starting in the late 1970s there was in Syria which [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2524.94s)]
*  was autocratic of course at the time, serious opposition against the regime of the far, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2536.42s)]
*  the Hafez al-Assad and that opposition was not only Islamist, it was leftist, it was [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2541.42s)]
*  nationalist, there were many objections to various aspects of the Ba'ath regime at the [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2546.42s)]
*  time. But eventually the strongest actor in that opposition, in that opposition movement [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2550.9s)]
*  turned out to be the Muslim Brotherhood if you want but really precisely one faction [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2556.94s)]
*  of the Muslim Brotherhood. Who drew that conflict into violence? Now they didn't have to draw [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2562.26s)]
*  very much, the regime was very prepared to use violence but violence also came from dead [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2569.94s)]
*  ends and there's the famous or infamous event at Aleppo Artillery School in 1979 where [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2575.34s)]
*  a commando of this faction, the fighting of vanguards, penetrated the school and massacred [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2584.1800000000003s)]
*  all the al-Awi officers and that also needs to go. And then you have a whole, of course [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2591.46s)]
*  a whole, the whole story of escalating violence, of people being kidnapped, being killed for [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2596.7400000000002s)]
*  no reason, no pain, no reason other than being al-Awi and so on and so forth and counter-violence. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2601.7s)]
*  And this legacy of violence lingered, of course lingered on when the conflict was over and [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2607.42s)]
*  whoever lived in Syria in the 1990s will know that. I mean you talk to people back then [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2617.1s)]
*  and this was very, very present and if you talk for instance to people, part of the minorities [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2622.62s)]
*  and Christians, the common cause was there will be a day of reckoning and after they [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2629.66s)]
*  killed all the al-Awis they come and kill us. I heard that so many times in the early [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2636.2599999999998s)]
*  90s in Syria. So that was very present as like something looming in the not so distant [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2641.1s)]
*  past and very easily to be summoned. Second is the nexus in Syria in particular between [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2648.14s)]
*  sectarianization and secularization. Sorry I'm probably pronouncing these. So after the [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2655.22s)]
*  conflict of the early 80s and late 70s as you know the security service, intelligence [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2664.94s)]
*  service called the MQ1, organized mafias had an extremely powerful role in Syrian society. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2673.3399999999997s)]
*  So wherever you were and whatever you would do you would have to pay bribes to them. I [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2681.34s)]
*  mean it's really, I think a comparison with the mafias is not entirely out of place here. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2686.58s)]
*  And the experience of let's say of, everyday experience of the ordinary Syrian would be [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2694.82s)]
*  that there's always some security officer somewhere whose intervention, support, what [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2703.54s)]
*  have you is in the end of almost anything decisive. To the point where even activities [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2709.06s)]
*  that were like by dissidents, I have an example in the chapter, would be read that way. So [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2718.42s)]
*  oh he can do that because he's al-Awi, hence he's well connected with security. Without [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2726.34s)]
*  really necessarily any factual base. It was like a default assumption that this is the [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2731.9s)]
*  case. So again the experience that access to state power, access to life chances, access [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2736.38s)]
*  to wealth is determined by these links where sectarian belonging, no, sectarian membership, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2742.42s)]
*  a sect on your ID card, whatever, is an important point. But the most important point of course [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2751.82s)]
*  is not sect but family. Family relations or local relations of people coming from the [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2757.62s)]
*  same local community. Now you know Syria, you know that all the discourse about the [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2764.62s)]
*  multi-sectarian society and everything apart, there's not much mixing. Mixing and so far [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2773.2599999999998s)]
*  as you have areas that are not associated with a certain sectarian group is restricted [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2780.8599999999997s)]
*  to the big cities. And even the big cities to a few central quarters. So in Ladi'i, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2787.54s)]
*  in Homs, in places like this, basically almost every quarter except the central one has a [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2793.78s)]
*  sectarian identity. And that of course even more so applies to villages. So if you use [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2799.34s)]
*  your relatives, if you use people from your area to achieve something, you are implicitly [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2805.1800000000003s)]
*  you're also using a sectarian channel and not only a local one. The third point, and [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2810.0600000000004s)]
*  again this feeds into the, if you want, the cognitive mechanisms of interpreting social [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2817.0600000000004s)]
*  relations being or taking sectarian belonging or identity into consideration, giving it [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2822.18s)]
*  in a very important place. And the third aspect is, and now we jump back from history into [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2829.3799999999997s)]
*  2011, are what you may want to call the repertory of protest. The way to protest and the places [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2834.3799999999997s)]
*  where you can protest. Well the places where you can protest. In Syria there was no public [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2842.46s)]
*  space in the sense of a space that was accessible to everybody and freely accessible before [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2849.78s)]
*  2011. You want to do anything anywhere, you always need either a relation to somebody [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2856.78s)]
*  or connection to somebody. And the few spaces that were neutral from a sectarian point of [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2862.46s)]
*  view that I referred to, the center and parts of the big cities, were under very tight security [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2870.86s)]
*  control and the protestors never got hold of them. Except for very, very short instances. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2876.1s)]
*  The central square in Homs, the Zahd al-Sar for one night, violently dispersed the same [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2882.5s)]
*  night. Hama for I think two or three days, again violently dispersed and Hama had its [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2890.38s)]
*  special problem. And on the contrary the central spaces were in fact claimed by the [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2897.38s)]
*  regime for counter manifestations of loyalty. Protests happened or were quickly restricted [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2907.54s)]
*  to places again with a clear sectarian identity. In places like Homs for instance, and places [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2915.26s)]
*  like the E.U. and hence associated with the sectarian marker of that area. That's about [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2922.26s)]
*  the place. The repertoire. There was not really a protest repertoire in Syria to a large extent [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2929.26s)]
*  that was devoid of religious symbolism. I would argue for the simple reason that religious [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2939.5800000000004s)]
*  sensitivity is one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful frame of reference in [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2946.74s)]
*  Syrian society. I realize that sounds orientalistic as a claim, but I think it can be backed up [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2954.7799999999997s)]
*  if you look at it. And other, if you want, frames, if you use social movement framing [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2961.7799999999997s)]
*  devices, in the end did not measure up to the impact that these religious frames had. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2969.78s)]
*  So you could go out and make this argument and make this claim, this is about uniting [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2979.1000000000004s)]
*  Syrians across all scenes, creating a unifying national identity. But even that kind of discourse [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2986.7000000000003s)]
*  would always be validated by opposing the other discourse of religious division. And [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=2994.02s)]
*  it did not stand up. It did not measure up to the impact of, let's say, funerals. You [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3001.02s)]
*  want to tell me to shut up, right? I'm getting ready. I'm getting ready to shut up. Funerals, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3006.02s)]
*  like chanting religious slogans. At some point in social media you could observe that religious [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3016.18s)]
*  activity, that actually the intensity of takbir, shouting Allah Akbar from the inaudible, became [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3023.8599999999997s)]
*  on social media like a yardstick for revolutionary activism. People would resort to that. And [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3031.1s)]
*  again, if you make these religious, if you use these religious repertoires, then eventually [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3039.18s)]
*  even those from other groups who would participate would become, would get second thoughts about [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3045.2599999999998s)]
*  what is this about? Are we included in this discourse of unity? [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3051.3s)]
*  So just to finish this, to jump forward from 2011 to 2017 to what is now being tried in [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3058.3s)]
*  terms of de-escalation, in terms of reconciliation deals, all these nice labels for eventual [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3069.38s)]
*  capitulation to the regime. I mentioned at the beginning the different techniques of [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3077.1s)]
*  divide and rule that the regime has been using forever. And the use of local identities and [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3085.46s)]
*  the localization of power through systems of patronage where basically you have the [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3093.06s)]
*  center of power and then the practice of power is franchised out to the bottom to people [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3098.7000000000003s)]
*  in villages, to people in regions who represent the state and reproduce the same relationship [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3104.98s)]
*  on that level. Be them Alawis, be them Sunnis, be them Druze, be them whatever. Whoever is [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3111.38s)]
*  relevant in that region would be co-opted by the regime into its power structure. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3117.98s)]
*  And what is currently happening I think is a recreation, a reconfiguration of that pre-2011 [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3125.34s)]
*  system of localized wielding of power that includes all communities provided you refer [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3132.6600000000003s)]
*  to the center, refer to the evil dictator. You can be Alawi, you can be Sunni, you can [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3142.06s)]
*  be Druze, it doesn't matter as long as you are loyal. And that's the currency I think [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3148.06s)]
*  in the end in Syria today. It's loyalty to the center, it's loyalty to the dictator, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3152.26s)]
*  not sect. And I'll stop here. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3158.26s)]
*  Last but not least. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3161.34s)]
*  Thank you Fred. Good morning everyone. I suppose I should start by congratulating you Fred [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3163.34s)]
*  on the publication of the volume and it really is an excellent volume. I think the literature [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3170.5s)]
*  on the subject on sectarian identity, sectarian relations has grown exponentially in the last [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3175.9s)]
*  15 years and I think this volume is part of a fairly recent trend of that literature getting [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3181.7400000000002s)]
*  increasingly more sophisticated in how we sort of try to understand these concepts. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3189.3799999999997s)]
*  Generally speaking as we heard in your introductory remarks Fred and just now as well from Heco [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3198.3399999999997s)]
*  that generally speaking a lot of the literature and particularly the commentary as well has [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3204.3799999999997s)]
*  been marked by a simplistic approach for the most part. And sort of there's a tendency [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3208.7999999999997s)]
*  towards like a zero sum, I mean this is just a quick run down, a zero sum approach to the [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3216.76s)]
*  subject. What I'm labeling here a maximal approach and a minimal approach. In other [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3222.6000000000004s)]
*  words it's all or nothing and again it's sort of the maximal approach would tend towards [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3227.36s)]
*  the primordial frame of reference and the minimal would I think came out as a reaction [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3231.1600000000003s)]
*  or as a backlash to the maximal approach but I think it went so far in the other direction [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3238.04s)]
*  that it ended up being as absurd as the position it set out to attack. So whilst the maximal [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3244.2799999999997s)]
*  approach is obsessed with the concept of sectarian identity the minimal approach is allergic [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3252.04s)]
*  to it and both cases it's very counterproductive to take these stances. So this volume and [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3259.2799999999997s)]
*  several other recent works have gone beyond this level of simplification. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3266.6000000000004s)]
*  Other debates that have marked the study of sectarian relations, I mean here's a question [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3276.5600000000004s)]
*  that comes up often, should we treat sectarian identity and sectarian relations as a religious [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3288.2000000000003s)]
*  issue or is it a question of just group solidarities devoid of deep religious content? Are sectarian [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3294.8799999999997s)]
*  identities fundamentally different from other group identities and these are important questions [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3303.6s)]
*  because they will dictate how we go about researching them and understanding them. Do [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3310.24s)]
*  we need to delve into historical traditions or religious historical traditions and so [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3315.08s)]
*  called sacred texts or should we delve into identity theory? And what is the role of religion [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3319.6s)]
*  because even if it is just a group identity it's still coded religiously, there's still [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3326.24s)]
*  a religious codification. So what role does religion play if it's not as a primary driver, [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3331.48s)]
*  as a theological driver? And finally are sectarian identities inherently more problematic than [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3336.88s)]
*  other group identities such as race or ethnicity or tribe or what have you? So these are questions [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3344.7200000000003s)]
*  that repeatedly come up in the study of this field and they're tricky questions. As in [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3353.2400000000002s)]
*  an attempt to try to answer these questions I'd suggest that maybe a useful starting point [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3360.6800000000003s)]
*  would be to recognize that sectarian identity is imagined on several layers simultaneously [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3367.2799999999997s)]
*  and that we may be missing a trick if we insist on viewing them either as a religious identity [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3376.88s)]
*  or a national identity or this or that. It strikes me that they're simultaneously imagined [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3382.7599999999998s)]
*  on these four levels and I think one's perception and how one imagines one's sectarian identity [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3388.64s)]
*  and how one perceives the sectarian other will depend on which of these registers is [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3397.48s)]
*  primarily in play at a given time. So the local level, I mean this is about sectarian [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3403.52s)]
*  identity at the sub-national level, this could be about family, rivalries at the level of [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3409.24s)]
*  a neighborhood or a village or a town or a city. So bringing it back to the question [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3415.56s)]
*  of where does religion fit in, it strikes me that at the local level, I mean this isn't [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3420.8399999999997s)]
*  about religious truths, it's far more likely to be about my neighbor who's from another [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3425.16s)]
*  sect, his son slept with my daughter kind of thing rather than a question of contested [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3430.0s)]
*  religious truths or metaphysical truths. At the national level I think this is far more [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3437.0s)]
*  important, I think it's the pivot around which modern sectarian identities revolve. People [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3441.8399999999997s)]
*  often suggest nationalism and national identity as a cure to so-called sectarianism, I think [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3448.52s)]
*  this is very misplaced because more often than not in the modern nation state, sectarian [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3455.52s)]
*  identity is sort of a lens through which national identity is filtered or seen, through which [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3462.68s)]
*  national identity is mediated. So we see this in Syria, we see it in Iraq and other places [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3467.84s)]
*  where what's at stake really is contested national truths rather than contested religious [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3473.64s)]
*  truths and it's about the hierarchy of power between, amongst the different sectarian groups [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3478.28s)]
*  and I think Heco really you sort of hit the nail on the head with the description of how [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3484.4s)]
*  people perceive the alignment of their sectarian identity and their political fortunes and [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3488.52s)]
*  what those people think are opened and closed by sectarian identity. So I think the national [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3495.36s)]
*  level is really important. Again not much room for religious truths here. I'd imagine [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3502.44s)]
*  that Saudi Arabia would be rather exceptional here given that religion is quite overtly [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3508.6800000000003s)]
*  used as a criterion for inclusion and a criterion for citizenship but maybe we can discuss that [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3514.28s)]
*  in the Q&A. But certainly in the case of Iraq and Syria and Bahrain I'd add as well and [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3519.48s)]
*  Lebanon, I mean the Lebanese fought each other for 15 years, it was never about imposing [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3524.2400000000002s)]
*  religious orthodoxy. So again I'm a bit skeptical about the role of religion there. The third [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3530.32s)]
*  level the metana, what I'm calling the metanational level, that's the religious level, that is [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3536.04s)]
*  where religion comes in and you see it in sectarian polemics between people who come [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3541.32s)]
*  from different countries. So it's the Lebanese shia debating sectarian identity with an Indonesian [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3547.24s)]
*  Sunni, it will very much be about religion and religious truths whereas if they're from [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3553.4s)]
*  the same country it's much more likely to be about national truths, demographics, political [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3559.28s)]
*  entitlement, etc. Finally the regional or the transnational level, this is where things [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3563.8s)]
*  like Arab-Iranian rivalry comes in, this is where geopolitics come in and I think that [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3569.48s)]
*  final level which is sort of a sense of a transnational solidarity that sometimes comes [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3574.6800000000003s)]
*  out, that last level is what might make sectarian identities trickier than other so-called [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3580.48s)]
*  primordial identities such as race and what have you because you end up with a foreign [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3587.48s)]
*  sect coded political rival and that facilitates the superimposition of geopolitics onto sectarian [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3592.84s)]
*  identity thereby blurring the line between the two. And what that leads to is the securitization [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3599.88s)]
*  of sectarian plurality within the single nation states thereby complicating sectarian relations [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3605.64s)]
*  in the single nation states. Now my chapter looked at Iraq primarily so I tried to take [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3611.4399999999996s)]
*  in the pre 2003 legacy and post 2003 developments and again here I think Heiko you sort of beat [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3620.64s)]
*  me to the punch in that I'd say in 2003 again I like the phrase you used society was primed [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3629.4399999999996s)]
*  for sectarianization it wasn't inevitable that Iraq would go down the route of identity [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3637.04s)]
*  politics but I think it was always likely in 2003 because of that moment because of [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3643.2400000000002s)]
*  2003 and the immediate years prior to that there was a cumulative chain of events that [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3648.84s)]
*  made it likely that this happened that this would happen I beg your pardon. So sectarian [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3654.7200000000003s)]
*  relations were fundamentally transformed in 2003 but the what came after 2003 didn't come [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3661.44s)]
*  out of nowhere it was building on an older legacy. One thing I will say about Iraq I [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3669.16s)]
*  think is really important to keep this in mind and this is why I don't use the word [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3675.12s)]
*  sectarianism to be honest because it has an air of sort of operating like a light switch [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3680.88s)]
*  it's either on or off you know it's either sectarianism or isn't. The reality is sectarian [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3688.04s)]
*  relations in post 2003 Iraq have gone through several shifts and how sectarian identity [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3692.44s)]
*  is imagined on each of these phases is completely different and I think our commentary outside [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3698.7200000000003s)]
*  of Iraq has struggled to keep up with the pace of change which is why more often than [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3706.96s)]
*  not it's out of date. Now a lot of these the ebbs and flows across these various phases [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3711.72s)]
*  a lot of this relates to state legitimacy and I'd say that state legitimacy is also [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3722.12s)]
*  features quite heavily in how Iraqis reacted to regime change and how they reacted to the [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3727.8399999999997s)]
*  post 2003 political order and what I've labeled this sort of this debate as a political order [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3734.64s)]
*  debate within Iraq I labeled it as the dynamic between Shia centric state building and Sunni [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3741.72s)]
*  rejection and I think that the interplay between these two animates the shifts between these [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3747.68s)]
*  stages. So Shia centric state building is a fairly low bar despite the grandiose you [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3754.72s)]
*  know state building you immediately think something quite visionary it really isn't [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3761.48s)]
*  it's about taking over the remnants of the pre 2003 state and ensuring that the central [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3764.8799999999997s)]
*  levers of the state are in Shia and particularly in Shia centric hands and that Shia identities [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3771.44s)]
*  are represented and empowered to the extent of leaving an imprint on the nature of the [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3777.44s)]
*  Iraqi state that's a low bar and it's a bar that's been met I'd say irreversibly so short [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3783.0s)]
*  of another American invasion. Now once you meet that bar you're going to have to present [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3789.12s)]
*  something you have to go beyond that and the Shia political classes are now in a position [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3795.12s)]
*  where they have to go beyond the prism of existential sect coded fears the sectarian [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3799.7999999999997s)]
*  others no longer seen as a threat or not an existential threat anyway which was not the [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3806.48s)]
*  case in earlier phases so that's Shia centric state building Sunni rejection a spectrum [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3812.8799999999997s)]
*  of resentment against the post 2003 order running from begrudging acceptance to armed [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3818.3199999999997s)]
*  insurgency now I'm suggesting I would suggest I think the book was written slightly too [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3823.96s)]
*  early for this but I would suggest that the events of 2014 the fall of Mosul the subsequent [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3829.8s)]
*  war against Islamic State and what have you may have discredited the violent end or the [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3837.2s)]
*  armed end of that spectrum of resentment and so what I'm dabbling with these days is did [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3843.04s)]
*  2014 signal the end of the culmination of this dynamic sort of the triumph of Shia centric [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3850.2s)]
*  state building and the defeat of Sunni or at least the defeat of violence and rejection [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3857.04s)]
*  in which case are we seeing Iraq move beyond the politics of sect and I think this is important [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3862.32s)]
*  and that whilst we have to understand processes of sectarianization and what have you it's [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3868.04s)]
*  not a one way road I mean eventually no identity can remain activated or mobilized forever [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3874.44s)]
*  so how do these things lose relevance perhaps through things like this perhaps we're seeing [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3880.48s)]
*  this happening in Iraq today and we are seeing a more confident style of Shia politics shall [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3884.92s)]
*  we say that's born of the fact that they no longer feel that whatever political gains [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3892.6s)]
*  they think they've made they don't feel that this is under threat anymore and I think that [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3897.8s)]
*  Iraq is light years ahead of the rest of the region in terms of sectarian relations and [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3904.2799999999997s)]
*  in terms of how the sectarian other is imagined and I know that sounds counter intuitive given [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3910.3199999999997s)]
*  that Iraq is sort of you know evergreen bad news but it's true in terms of the demonization [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3914.8399999999997s)]
*  of the sectarian other is not as fantastical as it is elsewhere in the region and it's [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3921.68s)]
*  grounded in a more nuanced experience based take regarding the sectarian other and where [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3928.52s)]
*  we are today I think the sectarian other might be loved he might be hated but he's no longer [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3936.32s)]
*  seen as an existential threat both ways and that opens a window of opportunity for Iraq [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3941.1200000000003s)]
*  whether or not that window will be squandered time will tell I'll leave it there. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3947.04s)]
*  Great perfect that was great everyone thank you I've got questions but I want to turn [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3952.52s)]
*  it over to the audience hopefully those questions will come up we'll take questions three at [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3957.08s)]
*  a time please do introduce yourself the floor is open. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3961.32s)]
*  Hi I'm Mona Yacoubian from the US Institute of Peace my question really picks up where [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3979.52s)]
*  the last participant left off and that is the idea that well Haiko you noted that while [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3987.0s)]
*  Syrian society was primed for some sort of sectarian response you also talked about but [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=3996.24s)]
*  for some sort of enlightened political leadership that might have staved that off and I want [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4002.36s)]
*  to understand. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4008.7599999999998s)]
*  That's utopian. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4009.7599999999998s)]
*  Sorry? [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4010.7599999999998s)]
*  That's utopian. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4011.7599999999998s)]
*  Okay well then maybe you're going to answer my question fast forward to where we are [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4012.7599999999998s)]
*  today talking about Iraq perhaps being light years ahead what kinds of responses at the [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4016.4s)]
*  government level could perhaps begin to look toward a diminution of the role of sectarian [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4025.56s)]
*  identity and is there a role for outsiders particularly the United States to play in [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4032.56s)]
*  that? [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4043.56s)]
*  I'll take that question. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4044.56s)]
*  Michelle Dunn from Carnegie Endowment I have a question about Saudi Arabia so you know [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4056.12s)]
*  with this possibility that somehow the Wahhabism will be downplayed or as you said sort of [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4061.12s)]
*  slowly downgraded somehow by the Saudi state by the royal family what kind of reception [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4068.7599999999998s)]
*  does that get in society? [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4078.12s)]
*  We hear very different things about where Saudi society is where different groups age [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4079.8399999999997s)]
*  groups or socioeconomic groups of the society might be in terms of their attachment to Wahhabism. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4086.42s)]
*  Sean Coughlin from the State Department regarding the discussion of sectarian identity and nationalism [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4098.12s)]
*  in the context of Syria and Iraq there have been rampant atrocities committed by all sides [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4114.28s)]
*  in these conflicts and I'm wondering if you could speak to how identity in the context [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4119.76s)]
*  of sectarianism or nationalism or religion intersect with notions of justice in particular [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4127.08s)]
*  justice post conflict for victims of atrocities. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4136.92s)]
*  Great you want to take the Syria first question? [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4144.92s)]
*  Well I mean I said utopian I mean an enlightened leader in Syria is a leader in the world of [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4147.92s)]
*  leadership that could have avoided that this trajectory did not exist obviously and I think [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4156.76s)]
*  it could not possibly exist I mean had it existed at that point we wouldn't have reached [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4163.8s)]
*  that point so everybody was very devastated with the speech of Bashar al-Assad on March [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4169.2s)]
*  13, 2011 somebody has counted and basically said they were he used the word fitness and [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4178.72s)]
*  the Arabic word for sedition 17 times by that count and in one speech and so of course [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4186.76s)]
*  if you go out and warn against something like that then you prepare your followers for it [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4194.52s)]
*  to happen and this is exactly the opposite of the illuminated leadership that you can [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4201.88s)]
*  speak about I mean the idea that the way this regime was built the top level could have [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4207.72s)]
*  gone to society so to speak and say okay I mean we realize there's a problem we realized [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4214.8s)]
*  we have this everything has to change we have to change we wouldn't have been in 2011 where [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4222.0s)]
*  we were when had this mindset existed in any shape or form and indeed the view was this [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4229.56s)]
*  is an attack on us nothing else I don't think there was any there was second thoughts about [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4237.56s)]
*  that from what we know the role of outsiders I mean Farnar could probably speak a long [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4245.120000000001s)]
*  time about the role of outsiders in creating the post 2003 mess my fear is a bit that if [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4253.4800000000005s)]
*  you I mean before a second we think about this like this imaginary meeting place let [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4261.12s)]
*  say it's in Geneva where everybody sits down and the Syrian regime sits down the Russians [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4272.12s)]
*  sit down and say okay let's try to think about a post conflict order that avoids a repetition [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4277.12s)]
*  of this and of course again that's utopian it will not happen because our politics point [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4285.12s)]
*  exactly in the opposite direction if you think about that for a moment my fear would be the [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4290.68s)]
*  result that in the end one would settle on doling out sectarian quota and national quota [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4295.5599999999995s)]
*  for the Kurds as simply the easiest formula and it's really like a formula that's not [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4305.68s)]
*  well I tend to think about Iraq correctly correctly I'm too simplistic you know but [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4314.36s)]
*  if you don't really want democracy because it's unwieldy as an occupying power it's [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4318.5599999999995s)]
*  very unwieldy they actually have the locals and the natives speak and participate then [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4323.72s)]
*  distribute chairs to local leaders and then you can pretend there's democracy because [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4332.28s)]
*  somebody is really everybody is really involved and represented but nobody has a say you know [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4339.679999999999s)]
*  you have they have a say because you gave it to them and hence they don't so that would [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4344.679999999999s)]
*  be my fear for if that were to happen I think the an alternative could have been and in [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4348.92s)]
*  some places it may still be although the way where things went the last two years I don't [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4358.08s)]
*  think one way could be to could have been potentially to rebuild society or the state [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4365.08s)]
*  if you want from below to empower local administration local community local councils to like run [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4372.96s)]
*  their own thing organize their whole thing and then build up rebuild the state from bottom [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4381.44s)]
*  to top now that's that's not necessarily going to look very democratic in our sense [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4388.44s)]
*  of the word because I mean in the end many of these of the areas that are today rebel [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4392.96s)]
*  hell you have very strong parochial structures you have like local families that run everything [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4397.68s)]
*  even and that you know you have sometimes local council elections and in some places [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4403.0s)]
*  it's really a family affair and others it's not but I mean at least that's a place where [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4406.8s)]
*  you could try and in some places it could it's going back in some places it is going [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4411.8s)]
*  back in some places it is still going some places in Idlib that are not controlled by [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4418.04s)]
*  Al-Qaeda and where you have local council elections and they go quite demographically [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4425.04s)]
*  and even women participate and get elected so I mean had one started three or four years [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4430.04s)]
*  ago of doing that systematically maybe the outcome could have been better I don't know [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4437.44s)]
*  the atrocities sorry I'm taking all the time go for it again I thought jump into the yeah [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4442.44s)]
*  speak to you speak to atrocities I mean there was enough yeah yeah and not that not that [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4449.44s)]
*  there's any shortage of in Syria but yeah I mean if I understood the question correctly [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4454.16s)]
*  about how these atrocities influence the intersection between national identity and sectarian identity [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4459.5599999999995s)]
*  well if that's the question I would say that what we've seen in Iraq and definitely what [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4465.96s)]
*  we've seen in Syria and in Lebanon atrocity has strengthened the tendency or rather yeah [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4470.48s)]
*  has fortified sect centric imaginings of a shared nationalism because as I said I think [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4478.719999999999s)]
*  I think the way the place of nationalism in these conflicts is that it's not an absence [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4484.36s)]
*  of nationalism it's a lack of agreement as to the contours of nationalism the contents [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4490.12s)]
*  of a shared nationalism it's a clash of two sect centric nationalism or more sect centric [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4496.2s)]
*  nationalisms atrocity plays a big role in augmenting that because it brings in the issue of victim [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4501.4s)]
*  and you look at a place like Iraq of course this is a thing that Shi'a's have been you [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4508.68s)]
*  know sort of a trope that they carried for many decades many generations it's central [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4514.44s)]
*  to Shi'a identity come 2003 with the emergence of a Sunni sect centric consciousness again [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4519.48s)]
*  it revolves around victimhood to a very very significant extent and it's sort of this [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4525.6s)]
*  dynamic of competing victimhoods and it's a very destructive dynamic because it stands [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4530.200000000001s)]
*  in the way of a truly national politics emerging it stands in the way of reaching across the [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4537.240000000001s)]
*  aisle so to speak with an eye to de-escalation so yeah we've definitely seen that in Iraq [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4542.92s)]
*  and Syria as well I'd say so in that regard your question as to how to address justice [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4550.16s)]
*  is very important and I think there needs to be a lot of thought into that there's [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4556.4400000000005s)]
*  the truth and reconciliation route there's also the amnesia route and some context in [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4562.24s)]
*  Spain being an obvious one here you know where the amnesia route is actually you know as [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4567.56s)]
*  unsatisfactory as it is it helped turn the page so who knows? [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4571.72s)]
*  I was society dealing with religious change in Saudi Arabia I was the last time I was [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4576.92s)]
*  in Saudi Arabia was shortly after the religious police had been stripped of their authority [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4582.92s)]
*  to arrest and with the I talked to a number of educated Saudis about it they're all kind [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4588.36s)]
*  of liberal and on board but they are a little bit worried that the Crown Prince is moving [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4595.56s)]
*  too quickly to counteract the influence of the clerics and particularly with the women's [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4601.28s)]
*  driving issue which was kind of a very symbolic issue I don't expect there to be a backlash [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4608.92s)]
*  but I think that it is certainly alienating a certain segment of the country but I feel [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4617.44s)]
*  that the Crown Prince has basically placed a bet where he's going to side with those [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4623.92s)]
*  people who want women to drive and who think that he doesn't who are more interested in [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4630.6s)]
*  jobs than religious purism and I hope that he wins that bet but there's always a possibility [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4638.4400000000005s)]
*  that he's wrong. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4644.400000000001s)]
*  Question? Afshan let me ask you one. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4651.4s)]
*  Vince Alifoso independent consultant. I was going to ask about the Iran Saudi rivalry [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4664.2s)]
*  and given the full US support to the Saudis with arms deals Saudi has a pure tactical [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4672.759999999999s)]
*  wahhabism and I was wondering if US support to Saudi Arabia not saying that we should [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4680.76s)]
*  pull back but is that is taking a side in the Saudi Iran rivalry is this fueling the [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4689.96s)]
*  sectarianism or in terms of Iran with the JCPOA deal I mean wouldn't the US for US interests [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4699.4400000000005s)]
*  wouldn't the US want to see a balance in the region I mean given that a lot of these differences [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4707.44s)]
*  are incredibly broad incredibly complex what would a balance do for US interests the fifth [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4713.96s)]
*  lead in the Persian Gulf the Uday Dar base in Qatar military bases economic cooperation [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4723.879999999999s)]
*  and GCC can you comment on that. Yeah that's a great question I think there's obviously [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4731.84s)]
*  two or three or more perspectives that you can sort of answer this from as say the countries [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4738.84s)]
*  involved right from the US perspective at least if we can step back to the previous [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4744.12s)]
*  administration I think balancing those interests was certainly part of what the Obama administration [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4749.56s)]
*  was trying to get across at least approaching a way that you could balance not just sort [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4755.92s)]
*  of the Saudi Iran conflict but even just the US Iran tensions and there were areas where [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4762.24s)]
*  we could do this but there were also areas that we couldn't do this right there's Syria [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4769.36s)]
*  where we clearly came out on either sides and that's a hard bridge to gap it was sort [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4773.04s)]
*  of unfathomable that we could support Assad but we weren't sort of willing to do the same [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4779.0s)]
*  thing that Iran was willing to do in support of our allies in the JCPOA itself of course [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4784.12s)]
*  was a step in that direction from a US Iran bilateral perspective but when it came to [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4794.16s)]
*  Iran to the US relationship with Arab allies in the Gulf it had the opposite effect on [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4800.04s)]
*  them it alienated them it felt like their concerns were being thrown under the bus and [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4805.5199999999995s)]
*  so in order to sort of counteract the grievances that our allies had things like Yemen fall [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4810.6s)]
*  into that space right so you're going to agree with Iran on this nuclear program you're [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4818.200000000001s)]
*  going to sort of allow them to you're going to remove sanctions and allow it just to be [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4824.360000000001s)]
*  a nuclear issue but you're not going to push back on Iran's extraterritorial sort of operations [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4830.320000000001s)]
*  you're not going to push the terrorism issue you're not going to push human rights whatever [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4838.0s)]
*  so in order to that I always saw Yemen as just sort of a well we'll contribute in this [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4842.32s)]
*  way to this security concern of yours without necessarily thinking of the larger regional [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4847.36s)]
*  implications of it right it was more sort of well we gave a cookie to this side we're [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4854.24s)]
*  going to give a cookie to this side I mean that's maybe a little bit crude but I don't [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4858.639999999999s)]
*  think it was all that removed from actuality now if you fast forward to the current administration [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4862.28s)]
*  it's a little more difficult one because this administration has a different sort of political [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4868.719999999999s)]
*  perspective on the Middle East and it's been sort of clear about that but also if you're [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4875.12s)]
*  Iran Iran has not made it easy to bridge this gap you know even though we've had this nuclear [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4881.08s)]
*  deal Iran's sort of stated objectives in the region have always been anti-American [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4886.24s)]
*  right they're the removal of U.S. forces from the Persian Gulf in particular they're the [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4893.48s)]
*  removal of U.S. influence in places like Iraq they they're anti-Israel which is a key U.S. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4897.5199999999995s)]
*  ally so Iran has also not been willing to sort of find areas of compromise Iran from [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4905.88s)]
*  my perspective has been a bit more maximalist in terms of its foreign policy not nuclear [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4913.8s)]
*  policy it compromised on that in terms of its foreign policy it's been a bit more maximalist [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4918.56s)]
*  in challenging the United States of what we get across so yeah I think from a U.S. perspective [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4923.96s)]
*  there are areas where it'd be meaningful and make sense to sort of smooth out differences [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4929.88s)]
*  with Iran Iraq I think is the best example of that but both structural reasons because [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4934.64s)]
*  of U.S. alliances and U.S. interests and objectives but also Iranian interests and objectives [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4941.0s)]
*  make that sort of impossible at the moment that's not to say it can't happen in the [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4948.84s)]
*  future but I think you know there is no trust and when there's no trust there's only competition [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4953.8s)]
*  and I think that competition is something that's very much alive and not going away [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4959.64s)]
*  anytime soon great we've come to the end of the first panel I want to thank you all for [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4962.84s)]
*  a great sort of tour of sectarian relations in the region please join me in thanking the [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4969.0s)]
*  panel we're going to take a 15 minute break for the next one thank you [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKyT-u6lM8&t=4974.2s)]
