# Khatib on New Book on Arab Activism
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [May 28, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXPfjKOW-g)
*  The Arab uprisings did not come out of nowhere. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXPfjKOW-g&t=0.0s)]
*  Activism is something that has been going on in the region for a very long time and [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXPfjKOW-g&t=13.52s)]
*  in different forms, even in countries that were generally regarded as being completely [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXPfjKOW-g&t=17.68s)]
*  quiet and where nothing happened. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXPfjKOW-g&t=23.02s)]
*  The book covers both monarchies and republics and it shows that in certain places regarded [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXPfjKOW-g&t=25.72s)]
*  as highly authoritarian, activism took place through informal channels, whereas in countries [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXPfjKOW-g&t=33.76s)]
*  that had more opportunities for formal political activism, what is normally referred to as [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXPfjKOW-g&t=40.64s)]
*  activism was more visible. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXPfjKOW-g&t=47.56s)]
*  For example, in Egypt there were opposition movements and organized groups such as the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXPfjKOW-g&t=49.52s)]
*  April 6th movement taking place and actually being very vocal in their demands towards [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXPfjKOW-g&t=56.14s)]
*  the regime. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXPfjKOW-g&t=62.68000000000001s)]
*  But in places like Syria, you could not have these kinds of organized movements. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXPfjKOW-g&t=64.0s)]
*  So activism took place through behind the scenes channels, through the arts for example, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXPfjKOW-g&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  or through cultural activities. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXPfjKOW-g&t=75.32000000000001s)]
*  In Libya, there was little activism taking place within the country but quite a bit happening [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXPfjKOW-g&t=77.84s)]
*  with the Libyan diaspora outside. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXPfjKOW-g&t=84.2s)]
*  And the same can be said about Tunisia, where the diaspora also played a very important [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXPfjKOW-g&t=86.68s)]
*  role in mobilization. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXPfjKOW-g&t=91.80000000000001s)]
*  Analysts can fall into the trap of looking at activism as something fixed and perhaps [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXPfjKOW-g&t=94.64s)]
*  looking for an activist prototype as a result of this fixed framework. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXPfjKOW-g&t=100.0s)]
*  As the book shows through a number of case studies from then different countries, that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXPfjKOW-g&t=105.18s)]
*  activism is very malleable and it's very diverse and it changes across boundaries and within [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXPfjKOW-g&t=109.46000000000001s)]
*  different countries as well. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXPfjKOW-g&t=116.7s)]
*  What we're witnessing is a process that is a very long term one and the results will [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXPfjKOW-g&t=118.66000000000001s)]
*  probably not be seen for perhaps a generation and that's why it's so important not to look [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXPfjKOW-g&t=124.18s)]
*  at activism as something fixed in time or fixed in space or belonging to a particular [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXPfjKOW-g&t=129.54s)]
*  type. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXPfjKOW-g&t=134.94s)]
