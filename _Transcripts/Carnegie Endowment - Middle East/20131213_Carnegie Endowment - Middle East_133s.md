# Wehrey on Sectarian Politics in the Gulf
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [December 13, 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlg73_xNw-o)
*  My book, Sectarian Politics in the Gulf, from the Iraq War to the Arab Uprisings, is really [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlg73_xNw-o&t=0.0s)]
*  an exploration of the Sunni-Shia divide in the Gulf. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlg73_xNw-o&t=15.16s)]
*  Specifically, it looks at the impact of sectarianism, of this divide on the politics of three crucial [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlg73_xNw-o&t=19.34s)]
*  Gulf states, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlg73_xNw-o&t=26.94s)]
*  If we really want to identify the root causes of sectarian strife, of sectarian discord [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlg73_xNw-o&t=31.700000000000003s)]
*  in the Gulf, we need to look at these regimes themselves, we need to look at their ruling [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlg73_xNw-o&t=38.58s)]
*  bargain, we need to look at their political institutions, and especially we need to look [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlg73_xNw-o&t=43.22s)]
*  at the lack of democracy in these states. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlg73_xNw-o&t=47.08s)]
*  The fact that these regimes exclude significant members of their society, significant portions [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlg73_xNw-o&t=50.5s)]
*  of their citizenry from participation in government, from the security forces, from [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlg73_xNw-o&t=56.02s)]
*  access to economic capital, those are the real causes of sectarianism in these countries. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlg73_xNw-o&t=61.7s)]
*  I think it's important for observers of this region, for scholars of the region, and for [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlg73_xNw-o&t=68.62s)]
*  U.S. policymakers to not be sidetracked or blinded by the static of sectarian discord, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlg73_xNw-o&t=73.46000000000001s)]
*  by the Sunni-Shia divide. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlg73_xNw-o&t=82.66s)]
*  Certainly it's present, but in many respects, as I argue, it's the symptom, it's not the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlg73_xNw-o&t=84.61999999999999s)]
*  root cause. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlg73_xNw-o&t=89.17999999999999s)]
*  So when we look at the geopolitical map of this region, we look at the tensions, the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlg73_xNw-o&t=90.86s)]
*  sectarian tension, the sectarian dimension is really on the surface. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlg73_xNw-o&t=96.89999999999999s)]
*  If we dig beneath that, what we find is it's about the lack of legitimacy, the lack of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlg73_xNw-o&t=101.02s)]
*  democratic institutions, the lack of access to economic capital. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlg73_xNw-o&t=106.53999999999999s)]
*  And this leads us to emphasize our real, concrete political reforms in these Gulf states to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlg73_xNw-o&t=111.62s)]
*  avoid greater societal tensions between Sunni and Shia. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlg73_xNw-o&t=118.62s)]
*  And to really recognize this strategy for what it is, is that it's a card that's being [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlg73_xNw-o&t=122.62s)]
*  played by regimes themselves. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlg73_xNw-o&t=126.5s)]
