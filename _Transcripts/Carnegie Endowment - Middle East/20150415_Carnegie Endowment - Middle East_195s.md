# Dunne on Egypt's Nationalists
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [April 15, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI)
*  After the 2013 ouster of President Mohamed Morsi, who had come from the Muslim Brotherhood's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=0.0s)]
*  Freedom and Justice Party, there was a resurgence of nationalism. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=17.1s)]
*  With a military leader, General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, later elected President al-Sisi, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=22.5s)]
*  coming to the fore, there was a resurgence of the kind of nationalism that was common [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=30.0s)]
*  in the era of Nasser, back in the 50s and 60s. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=36.019999999999996s)]
*  It's a kind of militaristic, anti-foreign, and populist brand of nationalism that has [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=40.22s)]
*  been revived in Egypt, has come forward very strongly. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=50.300000000000004s)]
*  It's a little bit different from, there was a kind of nationalism that prevailed after [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=55.06s)]
*  the 2011 revolution as well. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=59.260000000000005s)]
*  There was an attempt at that time to reinvent Egyptian nationalism, a more inclusive nationalism. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=61.42s)]
*  There was a lot of bridge building at that time between Muslims and Christians, between [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=68.22s)]
*  Islamists and secularists, between rich and poor in Egypt. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=73.02000000000001s)]
*  But all of that crumbled at the time of 2013, at the collapse of the Morsi presidency and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=77.74s)]
*  the return of the military to dominance of politics in Egypt. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=85.14s)]
*  Despite the fact that nationalists now dominate the political scene in Egypt and the other [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=89.5s)]
*  two political camps, the Islamists and the secular opposition, are largely absent or [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=94.74s)]
*  marginalized, there's still a lot of political turmoil and chaos. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=101.34s)]
*  Military elections, which should have been held in the summer of 2014, have been postponed [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=107.42s)]
*  repeatedly. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=112.74000000000001s)]
*  And this is because, partly, I think, due to the elimination of the other two political [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=114.18s)]
*  camps, differences among the nationalists have re-emerged. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=119.94s)]
*  Differences, for example, between business people who support the nationalists and the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=126.34s)]
*  military itself, or among different security services, internal security services in the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=132.82s)]
*  military. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=138.17999999999998s)]
*  We're seeing more and more signs of these differences re-emerging. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=139.17999999999998s)]
*  In a way, this makes politics in Egypt similar now to what it was in 2010, before the revolution, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=143.5s)]
*  when at that time we saw a lot of differences inside the Mubarak regime. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=151.34s)]
*  At that time, there were differences related to succession in the presidency. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=155.82s)]
*  But we're seeing some of those same factions re-emerge now. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=160.86s)]
*  What this leads to is a political scene in which there is not real competition, there [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=165.70000000000002s)]
*  is not ideological competition over the future of the country and different plans for the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=172.26000000000002s)]
*  economy, et cetera. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=178.3s)]
*  What we're seeing more now is personal rivalries re-emerging and people who are out for economic [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=180.34s)]
*  benefit who want to run for the parliament. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBYULsGbJI&t=187.78s)]
