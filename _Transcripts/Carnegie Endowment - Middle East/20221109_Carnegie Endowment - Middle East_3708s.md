Video Description: Palestinian institutions will be faced at some point with questions of succession. In recent months, thereâ€™s already been plenty of speculation around influential Palestinian figures jockeying for leading roles. But what institutions do various figures aspire to lead? How will a new leader or set of leaders be chosen? And how do the Palestinian people feel about the potential successors?

A recent article by Vladimir Pran and Nathan J. Brown seeks to answer these questions and describes the existing procedures for the Palestinian succession.

Please join the Carnegie Middle East Program, Pran and Brown, and three expert analysts of Palestinian politics as they discuss these questions and how the Palestinian succession could unfold.

# Palestinian Succession: Rules of the Game
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [November 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8)
*  Good day to everyone joining us for today's panel on Palestinian Succession, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=30.0s)]
*  the Rules of the Game. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=36.02s)]
*  At the moment, many may believe that the legal rules and regime for [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=37.76s)]
*  Palestinian Succession are irrelevant and that things will get [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=42.2s)]
*  decided without resort to constitutional processes and only after [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=46.04s)]
*  some contentious political wrangling by those within the ruling party FETA, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=51.08s)]
*  that currently holds power over the PLO and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=56.120000000000005s)]
*  the Palestinian National Authority occurs. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=58.64s)]
*  Two of our guests, Professor Nathan Brown and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=62.32s)]
*  Vladimir Pran have recently co-authored a paper at Carnegie that argues that, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=65.24s)]
*  in fact, the rules do and will matter. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=70.6s)]
*  You can find their paper in the chat box, excuse me, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=73.52s)]
*  if you have not already read it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=77.36s)]
*  So for this program, I'll be asking Nathan and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=79.88s)]
*  Vlad about what they think the process for succession might look like in Palestine. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=83.12s)]
*  I'll do this for the first part of the program. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  Nathan Brown is a professor of political science and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  international affairs at George Washington University in Washington, DC. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  He's a distinguished scholar and non-resident fellow at the Carnegie [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=99.28s)]
*  Endowment and author of numerous authoritative works on Arab politics and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=102.76s)]
*  constitutionalism in the Middle East. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=107.0s)]
*  Vlad Pran is a senior advisor with the International Foundation for Electoral Systems. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=110.2s)]
*  IFES works in 145 countries around the world to support elections, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=115.56s)]
*  election integrity, anti-corruption and democratic trust, and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=121.12s)]
*  inclusion in human rights in the context of elections. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=125.08s)]
*  There are the huge challenges facing Palestinians at the moment. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=129.0s)]
*  Of course, there are the results of the recent Israeli elections that will likely [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=133.24s)]
*  bring into the new Israeli government Jewish supremacist parties, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=137.07999999999998s)]
*  which have as part of their political platform the forced removal of Palestinians [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=140.88s)]
*  from both Israel and the occupied territories. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=145.84s)]
*  And there's the ongoing fractured nature of the Palestinian body politic, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=150.0s)]
*  split both politically and geographically between the authorities in the West Bank and Gaza. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=154.84s)]
*  National reconciliation still seems beyond reach despite the most [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  recent commitment made by all of the Palestinian political factions, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=165.56s)]
*  including Hamas and FETTA in Algeria. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=170.88000000000002s)]
*  We've seen Palestinian National Authority parliamentary elections called and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=174.4s)]
*  then canceled just weeks before the elections were supposed to take place last year. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  There was 93% of the Palestinian electorate registered to vote and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=183.28s)]
*  37 political slates on the ballot before that election for the PLC was canceled. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=187.56s)]
*  PLO elections have also been delayed and hamstrung by the failure of Hamas and [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=194.2s)]
*  FETTA to come to some agreement on how to bring Hamas under the PLO umbrella. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=198.76s)]
*  While Hamas refuses to recognize signed agreements between the PLO and Israel, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=203.84s)]
*  something that even the PLO policy making bodies right now are calling for [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=209.8s)]
*  withdrawal from, but still there is that disagreement. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=215.44s)]
*  FETTA elections that were supposed to take place in March have also been [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  postponed because of internal dysfunction. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=223.68s)]
*  Meanwhile, the security situation is really deteriorating on the ground in [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=226.72s)]
*  the West Bank with regular Israeli incursions and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=230.51999999999998s)]
*  sieges of Palestinian refugee camps and even entire cities for extended periods of time. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=233.23999999999998s)]
*  In response to the failures of the PNA and the PLO to protect Palestinian communities, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=239.56s)]
*  a new quarter of young Palestinians are transcending factional affiliations and [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=244.51999999999998s)]
*  are taking it into their own hands to protect their communities from Israeli [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=249.56s)]
*  state violence and settler violence. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=253.56s)]
*  Now to help us understand what all this portends, we will bring into the discussion [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=256.24s)]
*  in the second part of the program, Sanat Asarghalli, Salem Barahmeh and Fadi Kur'an. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=260.6s)]
*  The three are joining us from the occupied West Bank. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=266.8s)]
*  Sanat is a constitutional law professor at El Najah University in Naples. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=269.68s)]
*  Salem is the executive director of the Palestine Institute for Public Diplomacy [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=274.76000000000005s)]
*  in Ramallah and a non-resident fellow of the US Middle East Project. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=279.08000000000004s)]
*  And Fadi Kur'an is executive director of AVAAS, a US-based organization that [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=283.24s)]
*  promotes global activism on issues such as human rights, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=288.48s)]
*  conflict resolution and climate change. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=291.72s)]
*  We will have a live Q&A session following the opening remarks from the panelists. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=294.8s)]
*  To ask a question, use the live chat feature in YouTube that you should see on [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=300.64s)]
*  the right of your screen or tweet us at Carnegie and Dow using the hashtag [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=305.76s)]
*  pal succession. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=311.47999999999996s)]
*  We will also be dropping some articles by the panelists in the chat box [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=313.56s)]
*  throughout the program so that you can dig deeper into some of the issues we'll [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=317.68s)]
*  be discussing. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=321.56s)]
*  So let's have Nathan and Vlad join me. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=323.47999999999996s)]
*  Good morning, you two. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=328.36s)]
*  Vlad's actually with us from Jerusalem, so thanks for joining us at your late hour. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=330.04s)]
*  Nathan, let's start with you. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  Could you sum up your position in the paper on why the procedural frameworks [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=338.08000000000004s)]
*  matter when we talk about succession in Palestine? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=344.52000000000004s)]
*  I think there is this idea, particularly from those watching from outside of [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=347.76s)]
*  Palestine, that everything will get decided by the members of the FATAH [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=352.12s)]
*  Central Committee, the policymaking body of the faction. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=355.88s)]
*  After some type of political compromise is reached, perhaps in which the three [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  leadership roles are divided as a way to placate members of FATAH in the expected [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=365.20000000000005s)]
*  power struggle. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=375.68s)]
*  So what do you have to talk to us about those procedural frameworks and tell us [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=377.68s)]
*  why they do matter? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=383.56s)]
*  Sure, thank you very much, Azahat. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=385.56s)]
*  Part of the impetus for the paper is to sort of push back, I think, against an idea [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=389.4s)]
*  that's implicit, rarely explicitly stated as such, that other political systems have [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=395.16s)]
*  politics and rules and frameworks and Palestinians have personalities. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=401.04s)]
*  So to understand what's going on in Palestinian politics, you look at who's up [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=404.56s)]
*  and who's down, and a lot of speculation reads to me a little bit like Hollywood [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=407.92s)]
*  gossip, but just with way dear subject material. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=413.04s)]
*  I think, at least in my mind, it's not either or. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=418.2s)]
*  Yes, there's going to be power politics. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=421.6s)]
*  Yes, the maneuverings among senior leaders and coalition building and even back [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=423.12s)]
*  stabbing, that sort of thing matters. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=428.32s)]
*  But the rules and procedures and structures matter in several different ways. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=430.68s)]
*  Number one, they just provide the framework by which those things are done. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=434.71999999999997s)]
*  When previous succession, actually, I'll go back to 1969, when essentially FATAH [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=440.64s)]
*  began to dominate the PLO and Yasser Arafat became chairman, that was done [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=446.68s)]
*  through existing structures. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=451.6s)]
*  Of course, there was plenty of hard politics that was going on behind that. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=454.12s)]
*  The second thing that rules can do is they can coordinate, they kind of communicate [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=459.72s)]
*  to these people, OK, this is going to be the meeting where such and such is decided. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=463.24s)]
*  This is going to be the procedure we saw back when Arafat died, the same sort of thing. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=466.8s)]
*  Yes, there was some consensus among the senior leaders that had formed a little bit before. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=473.03999999999996s)]
*  But again, they needed to have some way to coordinate. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=478.79999999999995s)]
*  And finally, it tells you succeeding to what, right? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=482.88s)]
*  You read any Palestinian legal document and you come to the end and you see in what [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=487.03999999999996s)]
*  capacity is this person signing? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=492.15999999999997s)]
*  It's usually multiple ones. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=494.15999999999997s)]
*  And so there are multiple authoritative structures. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=496.15999999999997s)]
*  There's factions, there's a state of Palestine. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=498.4s)]
*  When it acts internationally, it might be the PLO, it might be the Palestinian [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=502.76s)]
*  Authority, even though there's some reluctance to use that among some Palestinian leaders. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=506.32s)]
*  So it kind of helps sort those things out. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=511.68s)]
*  I think what is remarkable about any succession in the current context will be that although [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=516.24s)]
*  those rules are often fairly clear, a lot of the structures are just broken. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=523.28s)]
*  So the Palestinian Legislative Council elected back in 2006 is key in some succession [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=527.68s)]
*  mechanisms and not there. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=534.1999999999999s)]
*  Or actually, Hamas says, well, wait a second, it might still be there. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=536.8s)]
*  So some parts are broken. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=539.8399999999999s)]
*  Second, I think there's a problem really with legitimacy and relevance that when I go [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=542.56s)]
*  there, which isn't that often, I'd be interested to hear from everybody else who's on the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=549.0799999999999s)]
*  scene. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=553.6s)]
*  The disengagement with kind of that politics at the top at a popular level is pretty strong. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=554.6s)]
*  So this sort of seems like elite maneuvering that doesn't necessarily affect people's lives. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=560.52s)]
*  So that's a second problem. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=564.28s)]
*  And a third problem is that these, when I said succeed to what, these structures and [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=567.1999999999999s)]
*  the relationship between them is just very ambiguous. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=573.3199999999999s)]
*  What's the relationship between the PLO and the state of Palestine? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=577.16s)]
*  What's the relationship between Fatah and the PLO? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=580.56s)]
*  These things are laid on top of each other and chains of command and authority just are [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=583.0799999999999s)]
*  ambiguous. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=588.8399999999999s)]
*  And that has been getting worse over time rather than better. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=590.4s)]
*  Before I move to Vlad, I mean, can you give us an idea of how developed the Palestinian [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=596.0s)]
*  processes are and particularly in comparison to other Arab governments? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=603.96s)]
*  I mean, you've written about constitutionalism across the Middle East. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=609.4399999999999s)]
*  So it'd be interesting to hear how developed you think those processes currently are. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=613.56s)]
*  I think when you come to sort of what I might call sort of quasi-state institutions, not [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=620.12s)]
*  necessarily the state of Palestine that's been declared, but essentially the things [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=625.24s)]
*  the kernel of a state that was created used to be called the Palestinian National Authority [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=629.68s)]
*  that now may be decaying. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=634.92s)]
*  But that actually has fairly clear structures. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=636.92s)]
*  And we saw them work last time when Abu Madz and Mahmoud Abbas was elected. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=639.72s)]
*  There is not simply a clear constitutional framework, but they're supporting legislation, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=645.4s)]
*  they're supporting structures. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=651.6s)]
*  So by regional standards, these are actually very, very well spelled out. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=653.0799999999999s)]
*  So Vlad, talk about those procedural frameworks that Nathan was alluding to here. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=660.48s)]
*  We haven't seen a transition of power for the PLO ahead or the PNA, Palestinian National [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=667.0s)]
*  Authority, since Yasser Efe died and Mahmoud Abbas was elected in 2005. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=672.8s)]
*  I mean, that was 17 years ago now. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=677.0799999999999s)]
*  President Abbas holds the leadership of the PLO Executive Committee as chair and as president [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=680.8s)]
*  of the state of Palestine simultaneously. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=685.1999999999999s)]
*  And he is the president of the PNA and head of FETAH. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=687.64s)]
*  Why do you believe the existing regulatory processes for succession will be respected? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=692.0s)]
*  Well, so to sort of follow what Nathan was saying, there are a couple of things. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=699.96s)]
*  First of all, I think and I'm quoting Nathan, when everything fails, look, what are the [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=706.88s)]
*  procedures, right? Look at the manual. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=712.3199999999999s)]
*  And I think in that sense, Palestinians are no different than other places, to reiterate [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=715.04s)]
*  Nathan's point. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=720.24s)]
*  So and I think we saw evidence of that. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=722.12s)]
*  I mean, we saw, despite everything, that Palestinians have still the most credible [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=724.48s)]
*  elections commission that is very strict about procedures. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=729.56s)]
*  We saw local elections, despite everything, that electoral process and procedures were [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=733.04s)]
*  implemented in a way that quite a few other countries in the region would like to see [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=739.08s)]
*  them. We saw quite a high level of competition, even without direct Hamas participation. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=744.0s)]
*  And we saw engagement of people. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=749.88s)]
*  I mean, the turnout was high. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=751.4s)]
*  The myth that youth is not participating in politics was completely dismantled because [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=753.2s)]
*  we saw that the data shows that youth participated more than their share in national [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=758.84s)]
*  politics and so on. So in national demographic. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=764.0s)]
*  So that kind of gives us the indication that, yes, rules do matter. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=768.88s)]
*  And when it comes to these various functions, these various positions, there are few things [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=774.4s)]
*  that we need to point out. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=781.9200000000001s)]
*  Number one is that right now, the three main positions or president of Palestine as fourth, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=783.36s)]
*  if we want to include that, are held by Mubabbas. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=789.52s)]
*  But that might not be the case in future. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=792.5600000000001s)]
*  And the reason is that, as Nathan said, although these frameworks are layered on top of each [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=795.56s)]
*  other, they're also somewhat parallel to each other in the sense that there is little legal [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=802.2399999999999s)]
*  and institutional overlap. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=808.0799999999999s)]
*  So, in fact, we're talking about three different succession processes. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=810.7199999999999s)]
*  And the first one, it's probably the easiest one that I will mention, and that's within [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=816.04s)]
*  Fatah, because there is now deputy in a personality of alul in Fatah who [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=819.68s)]
*  automatically vice president who automatically takes over as interim chairman. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=831.9599999999999s)]
*  So the in case of vacancy, for whatever reason, there is a clear succession line. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=838.4s)]
*  The that successor stays in power as long as the general conference doesn't meet when [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=846.0s)]
*  general conference meet, they elect new leader of the movement. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=856.36s)]
*  And we saw that in the past. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=860.36s)]
*  Again, as Nathan said, we saw evidence when Arafat died, Farouk Kadoumi stayed leader of [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=862.04s)]
*  2009 when the new chairman of us was elected. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=872.24s)]
*  So we saw that without general conference, the Fatah leader really cannot be replaced. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=876.32s)]
*  But now we have institutional vice president that's alul, he takes over. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=882.08s)]
*  So that's sort of the easiest part. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=886.66s)]
*  The second is PLO. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=888.96s)]
*  PLO is somewhat more complicated because there is no clear succession. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=890.84s)]
*  The guiding framework for succession is the statute of the PLO. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=895.48s)]
*  But it does not explicitly address the vacancy of the chairman. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=899.42s)]
*  So there is no institution of provisional chairmanship in case of vacancy. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=903.3399999999999s)]
*  In fact, the authority to elect the chairman lies with the executive committee, which can [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=909.62s)]
*  then elect the new chairman. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=914.6999999999999s)]
*  The general secretary, however, has no role whatsoever in succession. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=918.02s)]
*  So some people are speculating that because we have general secretary of the PLO, that [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=922.26s)]
*  person will automatically become interim and maybe take over and so on. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=929.3399999999999s)]
*  We don't see that in rules. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=934.14s)]
*  In fact, the things could get even a little bit more complicated because in case of vacancy [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=935.6999999999999s)]
*  of chairman, we will have 15 members of the PLO executive committee, meaning there will [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=941.5s)]
*  be three vacancies. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=949.06s)]
*  And those vacancies can be filled by PCC, by Palestinian Central Council, which replaced [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=950.06s)]
*  the PNC, Palestinian National Council. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=956.2199999999999s)]
*  So the chair, the speaker of the PCC might have a role in influencing the executive committee, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=959.38s)]
*  which will then be electing the chairman of the PLO. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=968.98s)]
*  So that is a little bit more complicated situation. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=973.66s)]
*  The third situation is with Palestinian authority. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=976.22s)]
*  And as everyone knows, there is a rule for succession in the PA in the case of vacancy [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=979.46s)]
*  of the president. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=988.14s)]
*  However, and that is the speaker of the parliament, speaker of the PLC. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=989.14s)]
*  The PLC doesn't exist. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=993.1s)]
*  It's been even officially, if you want to take a Supreme Constitutional Court's judgment [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=995.14s)]
*  as official, officially dismantled and no PLC member has standing anymore. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1001.62s)]
*  Even their salaries and benefits were revoked and so on. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1008.06s)]
*  So there is no speaker of the PLC. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1010.5s)]
*  So what do we have in that moment? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1012.54s)]
*  The only thing that we have is temporary or caretaker, head of government, caretaker [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1013.94s)]
*  prime minister, because there is no really rule how to replace him in case of vacancy [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1022.1s)]
*  of president. Simply he stays in power. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1029.8200000000002s)]
*  And we saw that in the past. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1031.66s)]
*  We saw when Ahmed Karey stayed as a caretaker prime minister for a while, for a whole year, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1033.8200000000002s)]
*  even after the new PLC was elected, he stayed as a caretaker prime minister. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1041.26s)]
*  So situation there could be a little bit more complicated where we have some sort of [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1045.78s)]
*  caretaker prime minister. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1049.06s)]
*  And then the question will be what does the Supreme Constitutional Court do? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1050.46s)]
*  Will they be entertaining appeals that might be coming either from elections commission, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1054.9s)]
*  which will be perhaps interested in fulfilling their constitutional, their basic law duty [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1059.74s)]
*  to run elections in 60 days? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1065.62s)]
*  Or maybe some other actors such as Independent Commission for Human Rights or maybe [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1067.94s)]
*  coalition of NGOs. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1073.82s)]
*  So the question will be who will and if they will take the case to the Supreme [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1075.26s)]
*  Constitutional Court, what will the Constitutional Court do? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1080.46s)]
*  Will they judge potentially that the requirement to have new elections should be fulfilled [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1084.74s)]
*  within 60 days, even though there is no provision of presidency? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1093.78s)]
*  Or will they appoint themselves as provisional president, Egypt style, or will they come up [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1097.5s)]
*  with some other solution? But that is a little bit of a murky water that we have a hard time [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1103.66s)]
*  predicting how it would play out. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1110.98s)]
*  However, we know who are the important players. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1113.02s)]
*  And that is certainly Central Elections Commission, certainly Supreme Constitutional [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1116.74s)]
*  Court, provisional prime minister and so on. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1122.14s)]
*  So those are the three main procedural frameworks, again, independent from each other. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1124.8200000000002s)]
*  And we could end up in a situation where we have leaders on top of those institutions that [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1131.74s)]
*  are not the same person for a while until things are battled out. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1136.38s)]
*  I will only just say to end, no matter what kind of process happens, I think in the end [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1140.6200000000001s)]
*  we will have to end. It will have to end with elections. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1146.46s)]
*  The popular legitimacy, despite the calls for reform of the PLO, despite the calls for [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1149.02s)]
*  over elections conducted in diaspora for the new PNC and so on, I think that the prize [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1156.94s)]
*  will be Palestinian Authority, the PA and the presidency. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1163.54s)]
*  And that will have to end with elections and no deal in smoked field rooms by a bunch of [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1167.14s)]
*  men can really replace that because it will not have binds on the streets and it will [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1173.82s)]
*  just destabilize situation more. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1180.94s)]
*  So over to you. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1182.86s)]
*  Thanks for that. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1185.94s)]
*  You know, Nathan talked about how the PNA and the PLO are sort of collapsed into each [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1186.94s)]
*  other. And there was some really deliberate reasons why that that happened. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1194.3799999999999s)]
*  But one of the important parts of governance for Palestinians, particularly in terms of [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1199.14s)]
*  negotiating a peace agreement with Israel, has been sort of the PLO foreign affairs [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1207.1000000000001s)]
*  functions that have now collapsed into the PNA foreign affairs functions. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1211.5400000000002s)]
*  So in this situation in which we could possibly have three different leaders for the PNA [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1216.14s)]
*  and the PLO and the state of Palestine, you know, as well, what exactly might that look [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1223.82s)]
*  like in terms of how foreign affairs functions are handled? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1234.62s)]
*  It seems like there could really be a serious crisis in terms of control over foreign [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1238.82s)]
*  affairs. We have some some precedent for the division when we had Hamas, Hamas [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1245.74s)]
*  government. Nathan, could you talk a little bit about this? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1253.42s)]
*  We wrote a piece and you reviewed it for Al-Chebaka about this this conflict between the [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1258.42s)]
*  PLO foreign affairs functions and the PNA foreign affairs functions. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1265.22s)]
*  I can I can talk about it. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1271.38s)]
*  I'm not quite sure I can clarify it. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1272.94s)]
*  But but and it is complicated, it's complicated on an institutional level. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1274.5800000000002s)]
*  And I would say it's complicated also. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1279.42s)]
*  I mean, internal institutional level is complicated internationally as well, right? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1282.1000000000001s)]
*  Because, yes, Israel has signed with the PLO. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1285.5400000000002s)]
*  On the other hand, Israel has direct dealing with the Ministry of Civil Affairs. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1288.46s)]
*  You have to bring in American law as well, because if Palestinians want to do any [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1293.3000000000002s)]
*  diplomacy, there is a very complex legal framework within the United States for [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1297.46s)]
*  dealing with Palestinians. It was written almost to make a lot of that diplomacy [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1302.1000000000001s)]
*  impossible. And so the best way to find this out sometimes is to ask a Palestinian [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1306.22s)]
*  diplomat to see their business card, to see what kind of institutional label they're [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1311.5s)]
*  using in a specific context. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1315.74s)]
*  So the best person to answer a question like that might be an American trained [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1317.8200000000002s)]
*  attorney like Zaha Hassan, who could kind of guide us through some of those issues. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1321.42s)]
*  Thanks. Yes, it is it is going to be a very difficult maneuvering that you have to see [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1326.5s)]
*  from the PLO and PNA because there is this collapse between authorities and in [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1334.94s)]
*  your right, depending on who you ask, a Palestinian diplomat abroad, some of them [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1341.26s)]
*  will say that they work for the PNA. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1345.7s)]
*  Others will say, no, we work for the PLO. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1347.94s)]
*  So there's even a conflict among diplomats on who they think that they work for [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1350.46s)]
*  with respect to their job as diplomats abroad. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1356.74s)]
*  I want to bring in Sanat, Salim and Fadi now to the conversation. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1362.14s)]
*  And probe them a little bit further, maybe Sanat can give us a little more clarity on [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1369.98s)]
*  some of these constitutional questions as well. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1373.78s)]
*  So now I want to ask you first, what we heard from Nathan and Vlad is that [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1376.54s)]
*  Palestinians have some processes in place for elections and there are good reasons [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1380.74s)]
*  why everyone has a stake in employing these procedures. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1385.02s)]
*  But but what the canceled PLC election showed was that if the ruling party thinks [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1387.98s)]
*  it will lose a grip on power, it will find an excuse not to go through with elections. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1393.42s)]
*  Just last week, PNA security forces prevented a popular conference from taking [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1399.94s)]
*  place in Ramallah that aimed to discuss how to reform the PLO and PA. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1405.6200000000001s)]
*  So even talking about elections and reform is seen as very threatening. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1409.9s)]
*  Can you explain the constitutional basis for the cancellation of elections if there [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1414.9799999999998s)]
*  was one? And how do we avoid a constitutional crisis from happening in the future? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1419.82s)]
*  Well, thank you very much. I think this is a very big question when we talk about the [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1426.9399999999998s)]
*  constitutional crisis and I think Nathan referred to it and, you know, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1432.26s)]
*  I refer to it. So I would say before we talk about the constitutional crisis, we have [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1439.14s)]
*  to look at the foundation, the constitutional arrangements in Palestine, the reason why [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1444.82s)]
*  all this kind of overlapping is happening. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1449.9s)]
*  So I would start by saying the problems that we are facing at the moment is not new. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1453.6200000000001s)]
*  And they started in 2005, even if some people say, no, they did not start it in 2005. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1461.06s)]
*  They just started now. I would say a major point for such a problem is the basic law [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1467.34s)]
*  itself, the temporary constitutional document that we have. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1475.1799999999998s)]
*  The basic law is, you know, it was drafted as Nathan was referring to the process [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1478.86s)]
*  before. It was drafted in a certain period of time. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1484.1399999999999s)]
*  It was drafted also to fit, you know, one president at the time, President Arafat. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1488.74s)]
*  In addition, the basic law itself did not provide any kind of balance of power between [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1495.66s)]
*  the president and even the just that you know, council looking at the crisis that took [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1501.5s)]
*  place in 2007. It was predicted if anybody would look at the basic law would know that [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1507.38s)]
*  such a crisis would happen eventually. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1512.3s)]
*  The type of the political system implemented in 2003 and the way the basic law got amended, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1514.82s)]
*  the lack of, you know, balance of powers between the two, the president and the prime [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1522.34s)]
*  minister, even the ability for the president to dissolve the legislative council if the [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1528.22s)]
*  legislative council could not meet or fulfill its duty in a certain period of time did not [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1534.9399999999998s)]
*  even exist in the basic law, while many or most of parliamentary systems, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1539.1s)]
*  semi-presidential systems provide such rights. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1543.78s)]
*  So if such rights existed at the time of 2007, maybe we will have different scenario of [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1547.06s)]
*  what is happening at the moment. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1553.5s)]
*  Going back to what Val was saying about the lack or the inability for the basic law to [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1556.6599999999999s)]
*  provide solution in case the speaker is not there for the Palestinian Legislative Council, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1564.74s)]
*  I would say despite the criticism I'm saying about the basic law, there is a constitutional [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1570.06s)]
*  solution to exit the crisis of succession if you want to take it. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1575.7s)]
*  It doesn't mean I'm very happy about it, but we can take it. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1579.22s)]
*  If we look at the preamble of the basic law, it clearly specifies that the, you know, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1582.5s)]
*  the basic law preamble clearly specifies that the PLO is the one that is superior to the [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1588.94s)]
*  Palestinian National Authority. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1595.6200000000001s)]
*  It's the umbrella for the Palestinian National Authority. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1597.26s)]
*  So after the decision of the Constitutional Court to dissolve the Palestinian Legislative [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1600.34s)]
*  Council, we can indicate that the only speaker left is the speaker of the Palestinian [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1605.3s)]
*  National Council. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1611.58s)]
*  And we can see that there were certain steps to provide that. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1612.86s)]
*  If we look at the elections, you were mentioning, you mentioned the elections. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1617.26s)]
*  If we look at the elections of 2021 and the decree for elections, that Article 3, you [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1620.34s)]
*  know, specified that this is the first election of the Palestinian Legislative Council, is [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1628.3s)]
*  the first step for the election of the Palestinian National Council. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1633.54s)]
*  In addition, there was a presidential decree in the past making all Palestinian Legislative [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1638.1399999999999s)]
*  Council members members of the Palestinian National Council. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1642.86s)]
*  So there is a constitutional actually answer about succession if you want to take it from [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1645.46s)]
*  the basic law. Does it mean it's the right answer to take? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1650.06s)]
*  It's a right step to go with. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1656.14s)]
*  I'm not quite sure because we can see all the overlapping between the institutions. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1658.38s)]
*  And another point to end with elections. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1663.38s)]
*  Yes, it's really good to end with elections. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1667.1s)]
*  But will elections give the solution for Palestinians? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1670.5s)]
*  I would say if we go for elections relying on the basic law as it is, then we will go [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1675.5s)]
*  again for political deadlock. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1681.3s)]
*  I would say if President Abbas at the moment or an interim president that will come after [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1683.06s)]
*  the first thing that they should do is to call for creating constitutional assembly [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1688.78s)]
*  or going for elections of a constitutional assembly to change the constitutional arrangements [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1694.78s)]
*  that we have to have more mature conversation about what kind of constitutional principles [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1699.6599999999999s)]
*  we want to have for the next stage. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1705.06s)]
*  Because if we stay with the current constitutional arrangements, I can tell you that a new [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1706.8999999999999s)]
*  political deadlocks will appear. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1711.62s)]
*  There is no clear division between the institutions. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1713.9399999999998s)]
*  Of course, there are talks, there is a draft in the Constitution, but the main answer or [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1718.1s)]
*  the main question in the draft Constitution is still not answered. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1723.1399999999999s)]
*  What is the relationship between the state and the PLO? [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1726.86s)]
*  It's not yet answered even in the draft Constitution. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1729.78s)]
*  So I would say the first step is to have this kind of conversation about the constitutional [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1732.82s)]
*  principles that we all should agree on. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1738.82s)]
*  Then we go for the next step, which is the creation for a constitutional assembly. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1740.9399999999998s)]
*  Let's assume elections take place. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1744.86s)]
*  Then a new legislative council comes and amends the basic law. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1746.86s)]
*  We don't know the result. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1750.3s)]
*  We cannot predict the result. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1751.26s)]
*  Who will win the elections? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1752.54s)]
*  But what we can do is prevent a new constitutional crisis similar to what we have in the past. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1754.02s)]
*  I will stop here. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1760.4199999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1761.4599999999998s)]
*  Thanks, Sanat. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1763.78s)]
*  So that is a good segue to open up the conversation with Salem. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1764.6599999999999s)]
*  Salem, as I think we've heard throughout this program, you have to have elections. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1769.74s)]
*  You have to restore political legitimacy. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1778.5s)]
*  But to do that, you need public trust. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1780.9s)]
*  And right now, I think the public trust in the Palestinian National Authority, as well [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1784.18s)]
*  as the PLO, is at an all time low. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1789.74s)]
*  It was low before the canceled PLC elections in April 2021. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1792.74s)]
*  After the cancellation, it seems like something, to me at least, something snapped among the [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1798.14s)]
*  people, particularly among the youth population. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1803.66s)]
*  Can you talk about that a bit and whether you think that the Palestinian public will [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1806.5800000000002s)]
*  find a successor to the current president to be legitimate regardless of whether [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1811.18s)]
*  constitutional processes are followed? [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1816.1000000000001s)]
*  Thanks, Saham. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1819.94s)]
*  Thanks, everyone. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1820.7s)]
*  It's great to be with you. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1821.34s)]
*  I want to start from the recent events on the ground to kind of give a broader example [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1822.4599999999998s)]
*  of what's going on. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1828.06s)]
*  I'm sure all of us here and those in the audience have been following the emergence of an [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1829.4599999999998s)]
*  armed group called the Lions Den. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1833.3799999999999s)]
*  And I very interestingly read an interview that was done with one of its leadership. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1835.34s)]
*  And they said two things that we stood out. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1840.1399999999999s)]
*  One was that the reason for their popularity is that they don't belong to any political [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1842.78s)]
*  party and they make sure that that's part of their communication with people constantly. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1848.3s)]
*  And the other is that they're not just fighting an armed resistance battle, but they're [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1854.7s)]
*  fighting a cultural war. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1858.94s)]
*  And a lot of it is around energizing and tackling the sense of deflation. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1860.22s)]
*  A lot of Palestinians, especially young Palestinians, feel. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1864.98s)]
*  And I think, you know, if you look at the majority of Palestinian society, it's under [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1868.74s)]
*  30, 67 percent of that population does not belong to any of the Palestinian political [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1873.66s)]
*  factions that currently exist. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1879.5400000000002s)]
*  And there's a huge disillusionment with the status quo and the establishment and [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1881.42s)]
*  politics that is played on this institutional level, whether it's the PLO or the PA, and [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1886.6200000000001s)]
*  have completely detached. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1892.66s)]
*  And while there has been hunger for a democratic process to to to re-institute this [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1894.3000000000002s)]
*  legitimacy. Obviously, we had elections that came after 15, 15 years, 16 years. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1900.22s)]
*  But when they were announced, they gave us three months notice and the electoral law was [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1906.58s)]
*  changed to preclude a lot of young people from running. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1911.3s)]
*  And so that we saw that energy and that craving for a democratic process and the agency of [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1914.94s)]
*  choosing leadership completely dissipate come the time for the registration of the official [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1920.7s)]
*  lists from young people. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1925.42s)]
*  But we still had a very high number of lists registering. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1926.98s)]
*  So I think there's a huge disconnect. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1930.5s)]
*  And what Lines then was able to do was very much address that internal vacuum of power [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1933.26s)]
*  representation. And I think the only way any any any step forward can be taken around [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1940.82s)]
*  succession, it needs to be rooted in elections and it cannot just be PA elections. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1947.1799999999998s)]
*  And we don't need just an authority to potentially sign a peace agreement. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1952.34s)]
*  We need to re-energize our national liberation movement. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1956.18s)]
*  We're entering a new paradigm and it's time to redefine our vision, our objectives and [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1959.5800000000002s)]
*  our strategy. And that needs to be built through consensus, not only between Palestinians and [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1964.74s)]
*  Palestine, but Palestinians everywhere. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1970.42s)]
*  So I see the PLO and the PNC is very central to that process. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1972.74s)]
*  And I think part of the changes in the law have have I've said that half of the PNC is [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1977.54s)]
*  made of the PLC members. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1983.54s)]
*  And I think that is an opportunity to start the conversation going. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1986.02s)]
*  So, yeah, I think young people are demanding change, are at the moment very at arm's [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1990.3799999999999s)]
*  length of the establishment and the movement. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1995.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, the PA technically only controls, you know, not the entirety of the bus, bus [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=1998.54s)]
*  bike, but some of the cities. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2003.54s)]
*  And and to reinvigorate our entire national project, I think it starts with democracy [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2004.82s)]
*  and political representation across the board. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2010.86s)]
*  I see that as the critical next step, especially around succession. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2013.1s)]
*  I want to stick with you for a second, Salim, because the question is, you know, how do [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2018.62s)]
*  we get there? I think Sanat talked about having this National Assembly. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2023.06s)]
*  You've mentioned that we need this as well as a precursor to be discussing these issues. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2027.74s)]
*  How do we get there when you have a situation in which you can't even hold a popular [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2036.06s)]
*  conference? Right. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2041.6599999999999s)]
*  And if you could talk to us a little bit about that popular conference and sort of who was [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2042.58s)]
*  behind it, maybe in a little bit about why it was perceived as such a threat. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2046.46s)]
*  Yeah, I want to also there obviously is an elephant in the room that we've yet to bring [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2052.86s)]
*  up. I mean, elections don't really happen if the Israelis and the Americans don't want [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2057.18s)]
*  them to happen in some regional players. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2061.58s)]
*  Right. I think that's also part of the political decision making and calculation. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2063.58s)]
*  And so I think it also starts with how do you get those different actors in line in [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2067.54s)]
*  supporting a Palestinian election that's free and democratic? [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2073.7799999999997s)]
*  And I find that that's part of the uphill battle that we also need to engage with, plus [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2076.8599999999997s)]
*  also putting pressure on our own leadership as Palestinians, whether in the West Bank, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2082.4199999999996s)]
*  Gaza or everywhere. Then we need political representation. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2086.62s)]
*  I for me, look, I would love to start with the PNC and I hear Sanat's comments on the [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2090.66s)]
*  Constitutional Court, but we can't even have room to talk about PLO reform anymore. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2097.7s)]
*  The space is shrinking on the ground. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2102.7799999999997s)]
*  And I think it was a group of people who are not formally an institution or an [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2104.94s)]
*  organization, but who wanted to try to get a popular conversation around PLO reform [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2111.2999999999997s)]
*  happening all over the world. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2115.98s)]
*  It was launched from Ramallah. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2117.4199999999996s)]
*  Even that was shut down without any legal basis. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2118.62s)]
*  I mean, I was asking around, it was the legal basis used to shut that press conference [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2122.18s)]
*  down and there wasn't one. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2126.46s)]
*  It's just anything that is seen as reform, transformation, anything new is seen as an [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2127.7s)]
*  existential threat. So the room is very, very, very small to have any of these [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2134.7s)]
*  conversations. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2139.62s)]
*  So that makes my question to Fadi very difficult. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2140.38s)]
*  Fadi, I wanted to ask you what type of electoral or democratic process would actually [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2144.1s)]
*  achieve fair representation for the Palestinian people in thinking about PLO elections? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2149.86s)]
*  But if we can't have a conversation, that seems like really pie in the sky right now. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2155.34s)]
*  But I want you to try to imagine for us because the PLO, for example, has this [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2159.38s)]
*  antiquated system in which there's proportional representation and it's still based on [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2166.82s)]
*  factional affiliation. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2171.82s)]
*  Some of those factions don't really exist anymore. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2172.82s)]
*  There might be just a few people left in some of them. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2175.38s)]
*  If there hasn't been a real renewal of the proportional representation. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2178.02s)]
*  But PLO actually calls for direct elections. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2183.06s)]
*  So in your mind, what kind of fair representation would actually be possible? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2187.38s)]
*  Should there be a need of fair representation? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2194.38s)]
*  Should there be within the PLO? [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2198.02s)]
*  Can we have direct elections? [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2200.6600000000003s)]
*  What would have to happen for us to see that move forward? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2203.1400000000003s)]
*  It seems like the ground is really ripe for it, given that there is all this activity [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2210.34s)]
*  in civil society, but yet we're still seeing a lot of resistance. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2215.26s)]
*  Yeah, thank you, Zahen. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2220.02s)]
*  It's good to be with all of you here today. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2222.38s)]
*  I think usually and where Nathan and Vladimir kind of started the conversation is [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2224.86s)]
*  usually where a lot of people want to look first, which is what are the actual [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2231.34s)]
*  institutions? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2237.02s)]
*  What are the processes in place? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2238.02s)]
*  Because that's where things eventually fall and can be played with. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2239.34s)]
*  But there is another conversation happening, I'd say, on the exact opposite [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2243.98s)]
*  side of the spectrum that Sanaa and Salim spoke to, which is if we were to use [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2248.78s)]
*  the kind of rosy veil of justice, of ignorance, and say, putting everything aside [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2255.38s)]
*  that exists, what would be the best design to ensure the most fair, transparent, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2261.6600000000003s)]
*  democratic and strategic representation of all Palestinian people across the world? [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2267.5s)]
*  And in that context, where a lot of the conversation has gone is that you would want [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2273.8199999999997s)]
*  to give an opportunity for 14 million Palestinians or the percentage of the 14 [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2279.8199999999997s)]
*  million Palestinians across the world, and whether in refugee camps or in the diaspora [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2285.18s)]
*  or within kind of historical Palestine, to vote for representatives within the [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2290.8599999999997s)]
*  Palestinian National Council that would be, as Sanaa spoke to, a kind of new [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2296.8999999999996s)]
*  constituent assembly, because the truth is that the processes and institutions and [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2301.74s)]
*  regulations that exist within the PLO are so dilapidated that even their narrative, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2307.5s)]
*  even the language that they speak to, does not represent where Palestinians are today. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2312.7799999999997s)]
*  Now, how could those elections happen? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2318.22s)]
*  Because it seems, as you mentioned, very pie in the sky to speak about this type of [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2321.02s)]
*  scenario where all Palestinians can vote. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2325.9799999999996s)]
*  But in fact, if you put that as an end goal of ensuring that Palestinians have [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2328.46s)]
*  representation, there are a number of solutions. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2333.82s)]
*  So one of the proposals, and I'm going to name some because these are still in [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2336.62s)]
*  conversation, but I think they're useful at this kind of transition point to also [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2341.42s)]
*  look at the options available outside of the boundaries of the context that we're in. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2346.3s)]
*  And so some of the options exist of, well, what if you take Estonian technology, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2351.18s)]
*  Estonians vote mostly online through verified electronic processes, you use [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2357.58s)]
*  blockchain and other technologies, and you create a process which is technically [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2363.1s)]
*  feasible for Palestinians to actually vote for representatives. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2367.5s)]
*  And then you create a type of list elections where people don't run as individuals. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2371.66s)]
*  For example, you can choose lists of 20, 30, 100 people, kind of actually similar to, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2378.14s)]
*  in some ways, how the Israeli elections function, where all Palestinians, whether [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2384.62s)]
*  you're Palestinian living in the US or whether you're Palestinian living in Lebanon, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2389.42s)]
*  can be part of that list. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2393.5s)]
*  You form these lists, and then they run with the goal of recreating the PNC to pursue. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2394.7799999999997s)]
*  That's one option. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2400.7s)]
*  Another option is kind of geographic because what a lot of people argue is this is hard [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2401.74s)]
*  because the Jordanians, the Lebanese, the Israelis will not allow Palestinians to [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2407.66s)]
*  have these elections. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2412.14s)]
*  So there's another thing that's being argued is how about you begin right now preparing [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2413.5s)]
*  for a situation where each of those communities decide for themselves through what this [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2418.62s)]
*  popular assembly group was trying to do, decide through themselves through popular assemblies [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2426.14s)]
*  who would be their representatives and do a town hall type process similar to the Freedom [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2431.1s)]
*  Charter development process that happened in South Africa. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2436.54s)]
*  So what I'm trying to get to with the limited time that we have is there are actually [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2439.9s)]
*  multiple options to create democratic processes that push towards full representation for [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2445.5s)]
*  the Palestinian people. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2451.58s)]
*  And I would argue that the 70 to 80 percent of Palestinians who are under 40 years old [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2453.1s)]
*  would mostly support these processes, one of these processes, because as Salem spoke [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2458.7000000000003s)]
*  to, they want their voices to be heard. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2463.98s)]
*  The question is, how do we make those processes a reality based on the power dynamics that [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2466.46s)]
*  exist on the ground right now? [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2471.7400000000002s)]
*  And the two points I want to end with is one of the interesting stories everyone's speaking [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2474.06s)]
*  about now in Palestine is the investigation documents that were used to investigate the [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2478.86s)]
*  assassination of Yasser Arafat or the death of Yasser Arafat have been leaked. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2485.02s)]
*  They were leaked from the computer of the former head of general intelligence in Palestine, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2489.5s)]
*  and confirmed by the people who were interrogated that they are actually the valid documents. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2494.3s)]
*  And one of the things that they showed was that basically everyone speaking, whether [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2499.58s)]
*  they were allies of President Abbas or enemies of President Abbas, kind of gave the exact [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2505.34s)]
*  same narrative, which is before that President Arafat died or before he was assassinated, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2511.26s)]
*  and Mahmoud Abbas was working and had conversations both with the Americans and even with some of [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2517.98s)]
*  his Israeli counterparts about taking the political cover off of Yasser Arafat and [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2524.94s)]
*  basically pushing towards a moving power towards Mahmoud Abbas as president. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2531.5s)]
*  And a lot of them were pushing about how within Fatah, and these are people that are now, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2537.5s)]
*  including, you know, Prime Minister Shatayyeh, who was one of the people interrogated, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2541.5s)]
*  who spoke very clearly about this effort to kind of push Yasser Arafat away and create a path for [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2545.58s)]
*  President Abbas to become president. And I would argue that what we need to think about right now [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2552.2999999999997s)]
*  is not just the electoral processes or the constitutional processes that exist, but who [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2557.34s)]
*  are the actors putting in work right now to ignore Palestinian democracy and representation [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2562.7s)]
*  and basically use both the technical, legal, and also kind of harsh, coercive efforts [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2569.58s)]
*  to put certain people in place in key positions so that they take that power there. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2576.62s)]
*  And I think we need to start analyzing who those individuals are. Some of the names are known [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2582.14s)]
*  and have been kind of referenced in the paper by Dr. Brown and Pran, you know, Hossein Al-Sheikh [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2587.26s)]
*  as an example. And one of, I think, the first paths that we need to begin moving towards [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2594.54s)]
*  is ensuring that it's clear to those individuals, both internationally from people who actually [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2599.58s)]
*  care about democracy and locally in Palestine, that they will not be allowed to basically ride [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2604.7s)]
*  into power after President Abbas. And I think the more difficult we make it for those individuals [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2611.2599999999998s)]
*  to ride into power, the most likely we make it for a democratic process to fill that vacuum. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2617.18s)]
*  But if we don't block them, then they're going to use what they have to get in that place. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2623.58s)]
*  So I'll stop there for the sake of time. I hope those thoughts are useful. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2629.34s)]
*  You really underscore that the, you know, why there is such a lack of public trust, right? [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2635.18s)]
*  Because of especially how this was confirmed in terms of how the abuse of power was taking place [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2641.74s)]
*  around the investigation into the death of Yasser Arafat. So I want to amplify what you said about [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2648.14s)]
*  other mechanisms for elections for a second and ask Vlad about this. I mean, you have, you know, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2659.5s)]
*  you're part of an organization that monitors and supports elections all over the world. To what [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2668.06s)]
*  extent is this feasible? Now, Palestine's kind of a special case in a way, because most of the [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2676.14s)]
*  people are outside of the territory. So if we were going to have PLO elections, is it, you know, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2681.9s)]
*  what are some of the pitfalls of having sort of online voting, remote voting like this, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2688.14s)]
*  particularly at this moment when we hear so much about election fraud, whether it's valid or not, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2698.62s)]
*  and the way that that impacts people's sense of the legitimacy of elections? Is this going to [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2706.8599999999997s)]
*  exacerbate the problems because of that lack of public trust going into them, or could this really [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2715.42s)]
*  be a possible solution to sort of de-fragment Palestinians and allow them to choose representative [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2722.14s)]
*  governance in the PLO in particular? [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2731.9s)]
*  Well, let me start by saying where there is a will, there is a way. However, [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2736.86s)]
*  and so number one, where there is will, there is a way. Number two, we've done this before in terms [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2746.94s)]
*  of having quite a significant amount of diaspora voting for elections. You know, I don't need to [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2753.02s)]
*  go through all the countries, you know, starting with Iraq, South Sudan, Afghanistan. So there are, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2762.06s)]
*  this is something we call OCV. It's a lingo in elections where out of country voting, [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2769.74s)]
*  meaning diaspora voting. Obviously, there is, for example, in the case of Syria, the Security [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2774.62s)]
*  Council resolution 2254 talks about the voting of all diaspora and so on. So there are examples [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2780.22s)]
*  in the past when diaspora was involved in voting. That being said, though, there is a reason why only [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2786.54s)]
*  one country in the world has internet voting for general population, and that is Estonia. And there [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2794.14s)]
*  is a reason why we have less people voting through electronic means being internet or others now than [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2798.9399999999996s)]
*  15 years ago. Some of the ideas in terms of internet voting, if we're talking about that [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2807.34s)]
*  online voting, were floating around during crisis in 2021 before elections were cancelled or after [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2814.7000000000003s)]
*  they were cancelled when we were trying to convince Palestinians that because of Jerusalem, they [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2821.82s)]
*  shouldn't be giving up on elections. And some came up with the ideas that maybe internet voting [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2827.26s)]
*  is the solution. And I worked a little bit on those topics, and I can tell you that internet [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2832.38s)]
*  voting is actually a very complicated thing, and it requires infrastructure that [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2837.5s)]
*  rarely any government has or it's ready to invest in. And it's a long term process. It's not something [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2844.78s)]
*  that can be set up easily. And I know that lots of people are familiar with internet banking. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2853.34s)]
*  Therefore, if we can do internet banking, why we can't do online voting. But again, and we can [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2857.9s)]
*  spend a lot of time talking about it, there is a reason why only one country does it. And that's [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2865.34s)]
*  the country that has very, very organized civil registry and certification system servers and so [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2870.46s)]
*  on. People now vote, for example, even Switzerland, some canton's in Switzerland gave up on internet [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2876.54s)]
*  voting because of the issues. So that's one thing. But again, it doesn't have to be internet [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2881.98s)]
*  voting. It could be something else. Then we come to the problems that I don't need to that [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2888.3s)]
*  Palestinians will know even better than I am. How do you organize it in Jordan? In 2008, the [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2893.7400000000002s)]
*  president's office, in fact, the legal advisor president's office shared with few of us experts, [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2899.5s)]
*  the third draft of the PLO law for elections, which envisioned voting around the world [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2906.14s)]
*  with two election commissions, one in charge of Palestinian West Bank and Gaza, the CEC, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2913.9s)]
*  and another election commission that would be in charge of the diaspora and so on, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2919.66s)]
*  except for Jordan. Jordan was excluded. So there will be lots of challenges, I think. And [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2922.8599999999997s)]
*  I will not make friends among Palestinians when I say that I will not see PLO direct elections in [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2931.1s)]
*  my professional career in the next 10 years. I seriously see enormous challenges of organizing [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2941.3399999999997s)]
*  something that would be credible and have that kind of representation. And so maybe other types [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2949.74s)]
*  of representative, for example, Fadi was talking about town hall meetings and so on, could be [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2956.2200000000003s)]
*  more appropriate. But in the meantime, and that links to electoral processes here in West Bank [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2962.2200000000003s)]
*  and Gaza, in the meantime, Palestinians are here and they are living under some sort of governance. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2969.82s)]
*  And that governance is the standards of that governance are slipping away. And we see them [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2975.66s)]
*  in front of our eyes melting years of investments that Palestinians made and the trust that they [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2981.26s)]
*  put into their leaders in developing institutions, democratic institution, governance institutions, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2989.5s)]
*  and so on. We see them sort of withering away. And I am the question for me is, are we coming [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=2995.1000000000004s)]
*  to the point where it's irreversible and they will be gone? And that will be legacy of Mahmoud Abbas. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3003.58s)]
*  Of course, there are some other things that I will not get into in terms of peace processes and [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3013.1s)]
*  services and governance in general. But from my point of view, the work kind of work that I do, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3018.86s)]
*  and it's about democratic institutions and procedures and that is something that we see [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3023.74s)]
*  really eroding. And Salam was talking about the arrests that were made. I mean, they were arresting [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3029.18s)]
*  and disbanding two days ago the press conference that was talking about the event. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3037.58s)]
*  They, of course, did it with the event. And so the institutions of freedom of speech [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3047.5s)]
*  think that we really 15, 20 years ago, we didn't see in Palestine that [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3053.66s)]
*  are kind of melting away. And from my point of view, that is a problem. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3058.8599999999997s)]
*  How about you? Yeah, you know, I think that you've hit it right on ahead. I mean, it seems like the [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3065.58s)]
*  first order of business in my view is how do we open up space? We hear a lot about shrinking civic [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3070.7s)]
*  space in terms of Israel's restrictions on Palestinians in the occupied territories and [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3079.2599999999998s)]
*  inside of Israel proper. But there is a shrinking civic space that's been ongoing for some years as [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3086.06s)]
*  well inside of PNA governance. And I wonder if Sanat, you might kind of talk about some of those [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3093.34s)]
*  restrictions on Palestinians who want to engage in the public square and debate and discuss some [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3102.22s)]
*  of these issues. Sort of what would need to happen in terms of repealing some of these decrees that [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3111.4199999999996s)]
*  President Abbas has issued? Can you talk a little bit about some of that that's taken place over the [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3119.2599999999998s)]
*  last some years? So if you want to talk about the decrease, right, because this is also [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3127.02s)]
*  a legal constitutional issue. And I think Nathan referred to it at the beginning when he talked [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3136.46s)]
*  about that one of the key players is missing, which is the legislative council. And that [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3141.9s)]
*  goes back to the lack of institutions or let's say the absence of institutions that Val was [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3147.58s)]
*  talking about. Yes, I agree with you. Like maybe 20 years ago, we wouldn't have seen that because [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3153.74s)]
*  maybe even they were not extremely strong, but at least we had institutions. And I think the [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3159.1s)]
*  existence of institutions, at least a space like a legislative council where you can have a discussion [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3165.66s)]
*  about the kind of laws you want to have, about the public policies you want to have, it is quite [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3171.8199999999997s)]
*  crucial. Of course, when you have a decrease, one degree, then another degree comes [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3177.1s)]
*  after it. Sometimes a degree that will limit certain freedoms and another one will cancel [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3183.3399999999997s)]
*  the previous degree because of the public pressure. It shows the need for an actual legislator. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3190.62s)]
*  And that leads me, you know, that leads me or puts me back to my first point. I don't want to seem [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3198.38s)]
*  boring, but that puts me back to my first point, which is the weakness of the basic law, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3204.22s)]
*  the fact that you have an article, Article 43, that has been abused. And everybody is justifying [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3211.1s)]
*  the use of this article, the issuance of such decrease, because when it suits certain parties [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3217.74s)]
*  or actors, the use of Article 43 and the ability of the president to issue a decrease. And I would [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3223.18s)]
*  say going back to one of the points about the Constitutional Court, because also in the paper, [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3230.46s)]
*  there was a discussion about the rule that the Constitutional Court could play in the next stage. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3235.18s)]
*  And again, this is very interesting for me, because I am maybe one of the few people that [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3240.14s)]
*  believe that the Constitutional Court is very important. It has a political agenda, like many [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3245.26s)]
*  Constitutional Courts in the MENA when they were first issued or established. However, I would have [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3251.5s)]
*  loved to see that decision in a different way, you know, dissolving the Palestinian Legislative [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3258.3s)]
*  Council. There is one thing that the Court could have done, which is limiting the ability of the [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3263.7400000000002s)]
*  president to issue a decrease according to Article 43. If the Court had done that, then maybe we would [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3268.7000000000003s)]
*  have a chance for elections to take place. So if the Court said, OK, elections will take place in [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3275.7400000000002s)]
*  the next six months, you know, during that period, the president is no longer able of using Article [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3280.94s)]
*  43 and issue a presidential decrease because part of the conditions for that article to have [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3286.94s)]
*  a legislative council that is not in session. Once we dissolve the legislative council, then it's no [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3294.14s)]
*  longer there. Therefore, the article should not apply. If they have done that, then maybe elections [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3299.26s)]
*  would have taken place. So to reply to you, going back to what Nathan was saying, to what I was [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3304.2200000000003s)]
*  saying, and of course to Fadi and Salim, I think it's the lack for me, the lack of a legislative [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3311.58s)]
*  council, the lack of different institutions. And, you know, this will always lead to a kind of [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3318.54s)]
*  centralization of power. This will always lead to lack of democratic principles and a way for the [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3325.18s)]
*  political system or the executive to protect himself by issuing such, you know, a decrease that would [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3331.34s)]
*  limit people's freedoms. Thank you. One thing that I noticed that the PNA has been responsive to [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3337.58s)]
*  is its protest. So we saw, you know, protests around the disbanding of the medical syndicate, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3347.98s)]
*  the medical professional syndicate, and we saw the bar association's response as well to restrictions. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3360.22s)]
*  And then we saw that the president pulled back on those particular things. So there does seem to be [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3369.3399999999997s)]
*  some responsiveness to the people, to civic society when there is a mobilization around a [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3376.54s)]
*  particular issue. You know, we see unions when they've organized and protested some measures [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3384.94s)]
*  taken by presidential decree that there has been some change by the PNA. I wonder, Fadi, if you [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3393.42s)]
*  could talk about that organizing that's taking place by different pieces of the Palestinian [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3402.14s)]
*  community on particular issues, then is there a chance that we might see some more [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3410.06s)]
*  organizing in a broader sense rather than on specific issues impacting particular constituencies [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3417.42s)]
*  in Palestine? Yeah, that's a great question. And what I would say specifically is, particularly [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3424.94s)]
*  when unions or the bar association, what they can do apart from actually protesting is they can [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3434.54s)]
*  shut down key government institutions. So when lawyers refuse to go to courts, or in the case [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3441.42s)]
*  recently with doctors, when doctors refuse, except for emergency conditions, to kind of go to hospitals [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3447.74s)]
*  and do their jobs, then they can really shut down the kind of government. And the same thing happened [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3454.38s)]
*  three to four years ago with the teacher strikes. Now, this shows the power of Palestinian civil [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3460.54s)]
*  society and that as omnipotent as kind of they try to claim they are, you know, in terms of their [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3466.4599999999996s)]
*  security forces. The opposite side of that that also needs to be named is that the PA is becoming [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3471.9799999999996s)]
*  more oppressive and coercive. And so with the teacher strike that happened, initially they [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3478.54s)]
*  backed down, they gave the teachers some of the requests that they were asking for. And then [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3484.2999999999997s)]
*  throughout the last three to four years, they basically arrested, fired, used many different [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3489.18s)]
*  tactics to basically fragment and break down the teachers organized work. And it's very likely that [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3494.54s)]
*  they're going to try to do the same thing with the doctors and lawyers and so forth. And so [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3500.86s)]
*  it's actually kind of an it's a good versus evil battle right now in Palestine. If I'm going to [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3506.86s)]
*  simplify it, you have Palestinians trying to push towards a dignified life, trying to push [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3512.86s)]
*  towards ending the occupation. You have people, we didn't speak about this a lot on the call, [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3518.94s)]
*  but in Palestine, there's something that supersedes democratic legitimacy in our society. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3523.98s)]
*  And it's revolutionary legitimacy. And it's historically been present in Palestine. And what [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3529.98s)]
*  the revolutionary legitimacy is, because this is not a legal term that's often used, I think, by [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3535.5s)]
*  Carnegie or anyone else. But in the Palestinian context, when people see someone resisting the [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3540.7s)]
*  occupation or resisting oppression, they become a kind of central figure. We're seeing that in the [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3547.4199999999996s)]
*  Junin refugee camp right now. We saw that in Nablus. We see that with some of the doctors [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3552.54s)]
*  and lawyers as well that are protested against this. And there's going to be a question, I think, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3557.3399999999997s)]
*  that's a clash that's coming within Palestinian society. Hopefully it remains nonviolent and kind [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3562.7s)]
*  of the democratic freedom seeking side wins. But it's going to be between those individuals that [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3568.86s)]
*  are pushing for these values and those people who are trying to maintain the coercive status quo, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3574.46s)]
*  who are, again, subcontractors for the Israeli occupation. And I think what Palestinians are [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3581.02s)]
*  realizing, not just from these protests, Zahar, but also from what happened in 2021 with the [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3587.58s)]
*  protests and events, Palestinians are realizing that when we unify and act together, we can [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3594.38s)]
*  actually shift the power of balance significantly and at least kind of shake the chains that our [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3600.94s)]
*  oppressors are holding us by. And the hope is that this work continues to grow and expand. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3607.42s)]
*  But the other side of it is that there's really a clampdown happening. And for people listening, [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3612.54s)]
*  I think on Palestine, similar to situations we're seeing in Iran and elsewhere in the world, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3618.06s)]
*  people need to make a choice. Are they with the side that's fighting for freedom and dignity, [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3624.46s)]
*  or are they going to support the actors that are trying to limit that with all the force they have, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3628.94s)]
*  whether it's the Palestinian Authority or the Israeli government now under the leadership of [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3634.3s)]
*  Netanyahu? That's really the kind of moral choice here beyond the kind of technical and legal [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3639.66s)]
*  options on the ground. I think that moral choice has become much clearer after the Israeli elections. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3645.66s)]
*  But I want to end on that hopeful note that Palestinians are retaking agency over their [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3655.02s)]
*  situation. And maybe a lot of these issues that we've been discussing today are going to get [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3663.8999999999996s)]
*  resolved. But it's going to take that Palestinians taking back agency that has been chipped away at [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3669.82s)]
*  over the last 20 plus years from various actors. But I want to thank all of you for joining me [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3677.98s)]
*  today from all of your various locations out there, from Palestine to here in D.C. Thank you [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3685.5s)]
*  all for joining us as well. This is a recorded show, so please share it with others and tweet [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3695.26s)]
*  out about it. Thank you so much. Bye. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27soGMkMN8&t=3702.0600000000004s)]
