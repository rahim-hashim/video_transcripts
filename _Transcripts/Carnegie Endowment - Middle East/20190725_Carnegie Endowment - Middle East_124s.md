# Sarah Yerkes on Beji Caid Essebsiâ€™s Death
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [July 25, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts)
*  President Bejikai de Sepsie passed away on July 25, triggering a new political and institutional [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=0.0s)]
*  challenge for Tunisia. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=6.12s)]
*  Sepsie was the country's first democratically elected president, so Tunisia has never faced [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=7.12s)]
*  this sort of transition. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=11.92s)]
*  The turnover has been smooth so far. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=13.66s)]
*  Following constitutional procedure, the Speaker of Parliament, 85-year-old Mohammed Anasour, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  took over as interim president within hours of the announcement of the president's death. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=20.88s)]
*  But we could still see some stormy weather ahead. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=25.18s)]
*  There are two main issues in the short term. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=27.12s)]
*  The first is that the constitution requires that new elections be held for the president [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=29.96s)]
*  between 45 and 90 days of his death, at the latest, October 23. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=33.8s)]
*  But the country is already scheduled to hold regular presidential elections three and a [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=38.88s)]
*  half weeks later, on November 17. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=42.24s)]
*  So the interim president and the electoral body must now decide whether they can pull [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  off early elections, and if not, whether they can legally postpone the 90-day period to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  November 17 to keep them on their regular schedule. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=53.92s)]
*  Anasour is also going to need to decide how to handle a new law passed by parliament in [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=57.96s)]
*  June that would exclude certain candidates from running for president in the next election. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=61.4s)]
*  President Sepsie had not signed the law before his death, causing anger amongst many parliamentarians. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=66.56s)]
*  The interim president does have the power to sign the law, but doing so may be seen [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=72.48s)]
*  as acting against the wishes of President Sepsie, who had spoken out against the law. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=76.2s)]
*  There are also some longer-term implications. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=80.36s)]
*  The first is that this is a major blow to Nida Tunis, the president's party. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=83.08s)]
*  The party is already fractured and operating in two competing branches, one led by his [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=87.04s)]
*  highly unpopular son, Hafidqah de Sepsie. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  President Sepsie's death could thus spell the end of the party. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=94.72s)]
*  Conversely, we are likely to see positive signs for Nida's political rivals, both [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=97.56s)]
*  Anahda and Tayyat Tunis. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=101.92s)]
*  For Anahda, with one of its own in parliamentary speakership today, this could further normalize [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  Islamists in power. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=108.58000000000001s)]
*  And for Tayyat Tunis, the party of the Prime Minister Yousuf Shahid, who had defected from [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=110.58000000000001s)]
*  This could give him an opening to take the presidency in November. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=115.64s)]
*  So all this means this will be a very interesting space to watch over the next few months. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS7X2Lj2-ts&t=119.36s)]
