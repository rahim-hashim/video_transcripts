# Dunne on U.S. Strategy Toward Egypt
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [June 05, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M)
*  As General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi becomes the new president of Egypt, the United States [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M&t=0.0s)]
*  faces some very painful policy choices. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M&t=14.76s)]
*  This is a longtime ally. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M&t=18.0s)]
*  It's a critical regional ally for the United States in counterterrorism and other security [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M&t=20.2s)]
*  issues in peace with Israel. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M&t=25.16s)]
*  But at the same time, it's been going through a great deal of political turmoil. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M&t=28.08s)]
*  It's had a failed democratic transition and now is sliding back into authoritarian rule. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M&t=32.64s)]
*  The United States undoubtedly will still need to continue to cooperate with the Egyptian [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M&t=39.04s)]
*  military on some issues, on counterterrorism, on border security, on maintaining the peace [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M&t=44.08s)]
*  treaty with Israel. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M&t=50.28s)]
*  The United States should consider rebalancing both its diplomacy and its assistance program [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M&t=52.76s)]
*  toward greater assistance for the Egyptian people as a whole, rather than just the military. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M&t=59.56s)]
*  The United States could institute a large higher education and vocational scholarship [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M&t=65.72s)]
*  program, a Fulbright type of program, to give support to the Egyptian people, to youth, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M&t=72.16s)]
*  to help to raise the general level of qualifications of the population. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M&t=79.2s)]
*  This will benefit Egyptians economically and also in the longer term politically, so that [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M&t=84.52s)]
*  they will be more able to reach a national consensus on the future of the country. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M&t=90.48s)]
*  The United States should also look at coordinating more closely with Europe and work with Europe [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  to try to convince our allies in the region, the Gulf states particularly. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M&t=103.2s)]
*  But also Israel, that it's in their interest to promote stability in Egypt through economic [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M&t=108.36s)]
*  development, private sector economic development, non-economic development that is centered [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M&t=115.24s)]
*  on the military and in building up the capabilities of the Egyptian people. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M&t=121.12s)]
*  Unfortunately, there is the possibility with peaceful avenues, political avenues being [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M&t=126.44s)]
*  closed off to many Egyptians, especially Islamists, members of the Muslim Brotherhood, that the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M&t=131.48s)]
*  country becomes more and more radicalized and that Egypt moves toward an Algeria scenario [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M&t=137.12s)]
*  in which there's an ongoing civil war or an Islamic revolution akin to what happened in [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M&t=143.24s)]
*  Iran. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M&t=147.68s)]
*  The United States certainly doesn't want to contribute to outcomes like that, which is [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M&t=148.68s)]
*  why we really need to rethink our policy now. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDf3mE8H4M&t=153.20000000000002s)]
