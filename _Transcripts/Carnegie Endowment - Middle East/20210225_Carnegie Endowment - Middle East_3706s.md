Video Description: Ten years after the Arab Spring, the socioeconomic and governance grievances that fueled the 2010-2011 uprisings are still prevalent across North Africa, and many have worsened in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite North African activists and officials pushing for reform, the region has received little U.S. support. 

Now, the new Biden administration has an opportunity to prioritize North Africa. The United States can ensure long-term stability by working with European and multilateral partners to counter Russian and Chinese influence and support the peopleâ€™s demands for greater voice and accountability in the region. 

Join us for a keynote with Daniel Rubinstein on the U.S. approach towards North Africa, followed by a discussion with Youssef Cherif, Karim El Aynaoui, and Nancy Okail assessing the challenges and opportunities for U.S. engagement in North Africa under the Biden administration.

# A New Strategy for U.S. Engagement in North Africa
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [February 25, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI)
*  Hello everyone, thank you so much for joining us today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=0.0s)]
*  My name is Sarah Yerkes and I'm a Senior Fellow in Carnegie's Middle East Program. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=11.68s)]
*  Nearly two years ago, Tom Hill, the Senior Program Officer for North Africa at U.S. Institute [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  of Peace and I convened the first meeting of the North Africa Working Group, a group [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=21.7s)]
*  of a few dozen current and former U.S. policymakers who care deeply about North Africa, which we [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=26.279999999999998s)]
*  define as Morocco to Egypt. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=31.939999999999998s)]
*  The group met regularly over the course of about a year to discuss different issues of [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=34.4s)]
*  importance to the region, including democracy and governance, economic reform, current conflicts, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=38.0s)]
*  security challenges and migration. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=43.8s)]
*  At each session, we heard remarks from U.S. officials on their priorities in the region. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=45.94s)]
*  The shared feeling among the group participants was that North Africa historically has been [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  underappreciated or overshadowed by other policy concerns, that a more comprehensive [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=54.32s)]
*  explanation of the national security implications of this neglect might prompt U.S. policymakers [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=59.28s)]
*  to increase their attention on the region. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=64.28s)]
*  Thus, we have a new report, a new strategy for U.S. engagement with North Africa, in [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=66.48s)]
*  which we argue that the relative U.S. neglect of North Africa has allowed Russia and more [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=71.52s)]
*  recently China to gain a foothold in a strategically important area that includes part of the African [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=75.36s)]
*  continent and neighbors Europe and the Middle East. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=80.64s)]
*  We encourage all of you to read the report, which is available on the Carnegie website, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=84.04s)]
*  which we'll put a link to here in the YouTube chat. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=87.44000000000001s)]
*  And then this morning, to discuss the Biden administration's approach towards North Africa [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  or what we hope to see from the Biden administration, we're very honored to be joined by several [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=94.2s)]
*  experts on the region. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=98.7s)]
*  We're going to start off this morning with a fireside chat with Daniel Rubenstein, moderated [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=100.28s)]
*  by Tom Hill, and then we'll turn to a panel with three experts from the region to offer [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=104.04s)]
*  their perspectives. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=107.98s)]
*  So let me now turn it over to Tom. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=109.4s)]
*  Thanks, Sarah, and welcome everybody. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=113.04s)]
*  We hope you will check out the report, as Sarah mentioned. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  Many people contributed to the report from in and out of government, and I think we've [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=120.68s)]
*  touched a lot of different issues that should reach a broad audience. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=124.68s)]
*  So widely disseminated if you get it and shared around on social media. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=128.68s)]
*  Let me start by welcoming Ambassador Rubenstein to our panel. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=135.32s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=139.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=141.48s)]
*  So for those who don't know, Ambassador Rubenstein is currently the regional director for Middle [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=142.48s)]
*  East and North Africa at the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, or IFAS, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=148.84s)]
*  as it's more commonly referred to. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=153.32s)]
*  But he joined IFAS after a long career in the Foreign Service that included stops as [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  Ambassador to Tunisia, Special Envoy for Syria, CG in Jerusalem, DCM in Jordan, MFO [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=161.26s)]
*  in Egypt, and other stops in Damascus and Iraq and parts of South America. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=172.22s)]
*  I noticed in your biography that you are fluent in Portuguese. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=181.54s)]
*  Is that a consequence of career or is that an interest of yours? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=185.42s)]
*  That was a way to get a nice time out from my favorite region in the Middle East, and [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=192.57999999999998s)]
*  I learned Portuguese to work in Angola, where I had a wonderful tour of duty in the early [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=197.89999999999998s)]
*  90s and then later on in Brazil. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=201.7s)]
*  Got it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=204.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=205.33999999999997s)]
*  Well, we won't ask you any questions in Portuguese today, but thank you again for joining us. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=206.33999999999997s)]
*  I want to start out broadly looking at the theme that we focused on in our report, which [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=213.22s)]
*  was that North Africa is an underappreciated region by policymakers. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=219.58s)]
*  So I start by asking you, what do you think we're missing by not giving greater policy [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=224.62s)]
*  focus and attention to North Africa? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=230.18s)]
*  What are the threats or the opportunities that we're currently missing by, the biggest [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=232.38s)]
*  ones, let's say, that we're missing by keeping North Africa in that somewhat lower priority [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=238.82s)]
*  list of places to focus on? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=247.73999999999998s)]
*  Well, thank you very much, Tom. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=251.34s)]
*  It's great to be with you. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=253.29999999999998s)]
*  I look forward to our discussion as well as to hearing from the very impressive set of [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=254.54s)]
*  panelists that we'll be hearing from soon. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=258.26s)]
*  Before I think we talk about missed opportunities, I think some acknowledgement is in order for [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=261.1s)]
*  I think what looks to be some fairly successful, quiet diplomacy that the U.S. and perhaps [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=266.34s)]
*  some of the U.S.'s allies have recently done to prevent spoilers from ruining the fragile [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=272.06s)]
*  Libya process, particularly the LPDF. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=278.9s)]
*  And I'd like to think that perhaps there has been some good work with those Libyans and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=282.65999999999997s)]
*  perhaps their external backers who perhaps would have tried to spoil the fragile but [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=288.26s)]
*  impressive results which have been gained to date. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=294.18s)]
*  I hope that there is continued effort in that regard and particularly as we get closer to [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=296.9s)]
*  December and December 24th being an election there, I think the incentives for potential [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=302.86s)]
*  Libyan spoilers and their external backers could grow. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=308.74s)]
*  And thus, I think there might need to be greater efforts, further efforts than those which [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=313.38s)]
*  have been taken to date to encourage Libyans and especially their external backers to let [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=317.68s)]
*  the Libyans themselves move forward, choose their own leadership, unify their country [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=323.22s)]
*  and move forward. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=328.46000000000004s)]
*  And I think more broadly, that opportunity for a successful resolution of the Libya conflict [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=330.46000000000004s)]
*  is a very significant one and I do hope that the U.S. does what it can together with its [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=335.16s)]
*  allies to reach that resolution. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=340.90000000000003s)]
*  I think maybe focusing out from Libya a bit to the broader region, I think there is an [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=343.58000000000004s)]
*  opportunity coming up in coming months and years for perhaps a greater clarity in U.S. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=350.62s)]
*  messaging to show some moral support for people throughout the North Africa region who are [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=356.62s)]
*  striving for a greater voice and greater agency in how they are governed and in their lives [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=361.62s)]
*  in their individual countries. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=367.7s)]
*  Not to over promise or to create unrealistic expectations and also not to distort what [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=369.86s)]
*  need to be the local genuine conversations and dialogues within the countries of North [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=376.86s)]
*  Africa on key issues of identity, on the role of the state in the economy, on political [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=382.14000000000004s)]
*  governance and many other issues. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=387.58000000000004s)]
*  But I do think a greater clarity in providing some moral support for those striving for [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=390.06s)]
*  that greater voice and also to call out the perhaps more egregious violations of human [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=394.82000000000005s)]
*  rights and people's ability to have a say in how they are governed. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=399.86s)]
*  And lastly, I think regarding Tunisia in particular, given that it is the successful case so far [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=404.58s)]
*  of a democratic transition, there is an opportunity to make sure that it stays on track. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=412.26s)]
*  Great. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=418.26s)]
*  Well, you covered a lot of terrain and the previous administration had in its view of [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=419.78s)]
*  North Africa started to talk about it in this context of other external actors beyond just [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=427.78s)]
*  what the US might do, but more specifically Russia and China and how Russian Chinese [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=433.78s)]
*  engagement, not just in North Africa, but around the world was leading to this new era of great [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=440.58s)]
*  power politics, which seems to be carrying over to the Biden administration and how they [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=444.58s)]
*  see threats and opportunities abroad. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=450.58s)]
*  How do you see the Russia and Chinese engagement in North Africa? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=454.38s)]
*  Do you see it as a threat to US interests? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=460.38s)]
*  If so, where specifically do you see it as a threat? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=464.38s)]
*  Do you see them making inroads in places we should be more focused on? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=466.38s)]
*  Are we missing things because the Chinese and Russians are being more aggressive? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=470.38s)]
*  What do you, when you look across the North Africa region and you see Russian and Chinese [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=474.38s)]
*  expanded or at least the perception of expanded engagement, how do you see that? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=479.18s)]
*  I think that the ambitions are clearly there. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=485.18s)]
*  I think there have been inroads made and it's probably too late to turn it off given the [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=488.18s)]
*  investments that both of those countries have made in both economic, the Belt Road initiative [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=496.18s)]
*  as a provider of security assistance and unfortunately notching some successes in terms of access. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=502.98s)]
*  But I think that it is a threat that those two countries are not there. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=508.98s)]
*  I think out of good intention to just provide resources to the people of the countries in [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=516.98s)]
*  North Africa so that they can go on their own self-guided transitions to greater stability, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=522.98s)]
*  to greater democracy. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=529.78s)]
*  I think both of those countries have alternative models that they would like to bring whether [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=531.78s)]
*  it's digital authoritarianism, whether it's certain models of economic development and [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=535.78s)]
*  governance that do not allow people to determine their own political futures. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=541.78s)]
*  So I think that is a threat to Western values, not just to US values. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=547.78s)]
*  And I think that there are some specific threats regarding the strategic location of North [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=551.78s)]
*  Africa, especially given that the US and NATO more broadly have taken for granted really [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=557.78s)]
*  over the last decades a complete freedom of movement throughout the Mediterranean for both [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=563.38s)]
*  basic and even sensitive tasks and with Russia and China establishing themselves. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=568.42s)]
*  I think that could be a problem. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=574.8199999999999s)]
*  I would hope that the administration working together with its allies can ensure that we [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=576.42s)]
*  don't decrease our effort, whether it's in terms of economic development assistance, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=582.3399999999999s)]
*  democracy and governance and security assistance so that our friends and really everyone in [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=587.06s)]
*  North Africa don't feel they have to turn to these two countries who are offering various [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=593.6199999999999s)]
*  blandishments. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=597.6999999999999s)]
*  But it is an issue, I think, really throughout the entire North Africa region. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=598.42s)]
*  So in your response, you raised North Africa's geostrategic importance or location as a [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=603.38s)]
*  geostrategically important matter. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=609.7s)]
*  And in the past, and this is not a Democrat or Republican or even a specific administration's [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=612.9s)]
*  point of view, but it's really been American policy, I would argue that North Africa is seen [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=620.02s)]
*  as Europe's backyard, that Europe has enormous trade and security interests in the region. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=626.58s)]
*  And so if there are peace and stability initiatives to be taken, that it should be led or [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=635.62s)]
*  spearheaded by the Europeans given their investments there and the colonial history that [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=642.5s)]
*  exists as well. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=648.26s)]
*  In a sense, the policy has been to outsource North Africa to the Europeans. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=650.82s)]
*  Why do you think, if you agree, that that policy is not how we should look at North [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=657.38s)]
*  Africa going forward as Americans? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=663.94s)]
*  What should our response be to those who say we don't need to focus on North Africa because [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=667.38s)]
*  this is really Europe's to deal with? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=673.14s)]
*  I think that the notion that this region could be outsourced, quote unquote, to Europe, I think [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=675.62s)]
*  it's foolhardy. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=682.74s)]
*  I don't think it's realistic. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=684.74s)]
*  And also, it frankly is a little bit disrespectful to the people throughout the region to [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=686.34s)]
*  think that those on the other side of the Mediterranean can take them under some kind of [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=691.14s)]
*  umbrella and take care of their problems, if you will, in loco parentis. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=695.86s)]
*  I think it's just not the right way to go. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=700.82s)]
*  I think that there are some specific issues pertaining to some of the key European powers [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=702.98s)]
*  that frankly prevent a very cohesive approach, whether in terms of the European Union or NATO. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=708.5s)]
*  There are some conflicts of interest, if you will, that go back some decades in North Africa [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=714.74s)]
*  among some of the key European players. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=720.34s)]
*  So the idea that the United States could, in effect, outsource this region, I think it's [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=722.26s)]
*  just not well grounded. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=727.54s)]
*  I do think that the focus on strengthening our alliance with our European friends does help [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=728.98s)]
*  us, I think, provide the energy to work with some of the individual European states, both [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=736.02s)]
*  on a one-off basis, as well as in perhaps some groupings specifically on issues like Libya, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=741.86s)]
*  where we have a lot of our US friends working across purposes. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=749.78s)]
*  It's not helpful. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=753.94s)]
*  And I think if we could get some of our key European allies to work a little bit more [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=754.98s)]
*  closely together, that would help also bring about a day in which some of the countries [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=759.54s)]
*  outside of Europe, particularly in the broader Middle East, would maybe find a glide path to [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=765.46s)]
*  intervene less in Libya. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=771.06s)]
*  I do think, though, that there is key work to be done with some of the key European countries, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=772.66s)]
*  but to outsource it to the full multilateral European institutions, I think, is just not [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=776.8199999999999s)]
*  well grounded. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=783.06s)]
*  So I only have time for one more question, so I'm going to ask you something that is [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=783.6999999999999s)]
*  incredibly easy to answer. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=789.9399999999999s)]
*  We're going to talk about regional economic integration. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=791.2199999999999s)]
*  So this, as you well know, has been an aspiration both of external and the countries within the [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=793.94s)]
*  region that East-West trade be facilitated, the belief being that East-West trade would [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=802.58s)]
*  facilitate a lot of the or alleviate a lot of the economic stresses that some of these countries [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=810.02s)]
*  now face, and that it benefits everybody if the barriers that stovepipe these countries could be [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=814.98s)]
*  brought down. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=822.42s)]
*  And through no fault of, I think, any one particular agent, none of this has ever come to [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=823.06s)]
*  pass, despite rhetorical support for regional economic integration, both from governments [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=830.3399999999999s)]
*  within the region and governments outside the region. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=836.5s)]
*  In the remaining time that we have, what do you see as the principal reason why it is so hard to [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=841.4599999999999s)]
*  coordinate regional economic integration? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=849.38s)]
*  What is the major stumbling block to getting regional economic integration moving forward in [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=851.22s)]
*  a productive way? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=858.1800000000001s)]
*  And are you one of the people who believe that regional economic integration is maybe not the [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=859.3000000000001s)]
*  silver bullet, but a major key to unlocking or resolving or alleviating a lot of the stresses [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=865.86s)]
*  that we see elsewhere in terms of jobs and economic opportunity, productivity, etc.? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=872.74s)]
*  I think, Tom, you have identified a key area for perhaps better performance on the part of the US [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=881.22s)]
*  and our allies. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=887.78s)]
*  I think there are some real stop signs or obstacles in the path of greater regional economic [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=888.98s)]
*  integration. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=895.78s)]
*  The frozen nature of the conflict, the Western Sahara issue has been one of them, which has [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=896.74s)]
*  prevented two of the key countries of this region from being able to work together in a larger forum [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=902.26s)]
*  in significant ways that might argue for greater effort, frankly, on the part of the US and others [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=909.46s)]
*  to revitalize a diplomatic peaceful resolution of that conflict. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=915.22s)]
*  But I think that there are some older roots. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=921.94s)]
*  I think that many of the countries in North Africa have an unhelpful inheritance regarding [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=924.2600000000001s)]
*  self-sufficiency, even autarky, protectionism that they have to get over. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=929.5400000000001s)]
*  But more recently, I think many of the individual countries of the region have built themselves up [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=934.9s)]
*  as the hub or the gateway to Africa. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=940.74s)]
*  And it will be difficult to overcome that and realize that perhaps they can only become a hub [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=943.6999999999999s)]
*  or a gateway if they lower some of the barriers. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=948.5s)]
*  There aren't barriers now for the free flow of ideas, and that's good. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=952.1s)]
*  And the youth and civil society activists, they are circulating their ideas and their frustrations. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=956.42s)]
*  But opportunities for jobs and trade and investment are not circulating as freely, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=962.74s)]
*  and that's a problem. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=968.1800000000001s)]
*  Well, we could go on and on about where you think things could improve or things could change or [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=970.26s)]
*  new ideas that might impact the region in positive ways. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=976.82s)]
*  But we have a panel to get to, and I appreciate the time that you've been generous enough to give us. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=979.3s)]
*  And I thank you for your insights. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=984.26s)]
*  I thank you again for your service, too. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=985.86s)]
*  And you did a wonderful job as ambassador in Tunis. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=988.02s)]
*  And it was sad for me when you left. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=990.9s)]
*  I'm sure you have fond memories of your time there, but I hope you're enjoying your new perch. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=993.78s)]
*  Thank you very much, Tom. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=998.74s)]
*  It's been great chatting with you. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=999.78s)]
*  I do look back fondly upon those times, but there are important challenges. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1002.1800000000001s)]
*  We do have some key elections coming up in this region, by the way, this year, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1006.58s)]
*  in Morocco, in Algeria, and in Libya. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1010.5s)]
*  And obviously, organizations such as IFAS are willing and able to help out in that regard. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1012.9s)]
*  So thank you very much, and I look forward to hearing from the panelists. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1017.7800000000001s)]
*  Thank you again. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1020.9000000000001s)]
*  Sarah? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1022.82s)]
*  Great. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1028.1000000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1028.5800000000002s)]
*  Thank you, Tom and Daniel. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1029.6200000000001s)]
*  I think that you gave us quite a bit to think about, and I think this will lead us [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1031.06s)]
*  very well into the panel. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1035.06s)]
*  So let me introduce our three panelists. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1036.74s)]
*  We are so pleased to be joined today by Youssef Sharif, who is the director of Global Centers Tunis, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1039.06s)]
*  Kareem Alainawi, who is the president of the Policy Center for the New South, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1044.58s)]
*  and Nancy O'Kale, who is a scholar and advocate of human rights and democracy [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1049.1399999999999s)]
*  and was appointed as a visiting scholar in 2020 at Stanford University. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1053.1399999999999s)]
*  And just for the audience, I just want to let you know, throughout the discussion, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1057.3s)]
*  you can ask us questions. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1060.58s)]
*  To ask us a question, please use the live chat feature in YouTube, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1062.34s)]
*  and then I will be able to see your questions, and I will weave them in to our discussion [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1065.86s)]
*  as we go along. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1069.06s)]
*  But let me start with a question for our three panelists, which is this. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1070.1799999999998s)]
*  North Africa is a varied region with a wide range of needs. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1074.26s)]
*  What do each of you see is the most important thing that the Biden administration [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1077.86s)]
*  could do in North Africa? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1081.78s)]
*  And I encourage you to answer either at the regional level or on an individual country basis. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1082.98s)]
*  And let's start with Kareem. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1087.62s)]
*  With me or Youssef? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1097.78s)]
*  With me? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1099.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1099.62s)]
*  Sorry, yes. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1100.1s)]
*  Oh, yes, go ahead. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1100.58s)]
*  Thank you, Sarah. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1101.86s)]
*  It's a pleasure to be with you, and congratulations for the report. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1102.58s)]
*  Ready to lots of interest. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1108.26s)]
*  Well, my response, my answer will be very simple. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1110.6599999999999s)]
*  Spend some time on the region. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1113.6999999999998s)]
*  You know, if you are, I guess, interest is the increasing function of the time [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1117.78s)]
*  and the resource you dedicate. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1126.34s)]
*  I think there are important issues that were mentioned earlier on in terms of particularly [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1127.7s)]
*  the Libyan issue, I think is a source of uncertainty, is a source of risk, is a source of [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1134.82s)]
*  problems and threats and sort of basic security threats, which in a way has an important impact [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1143.38s)]
*  on the region. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1152.02s)]
*  So I guess, you know, spending time focusing on Libya and also listening, I guess, and, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1152.58s)]
*  you know, having dialogues at all levels of society. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1160.34s)]
*  I think, you know, government to government dialogues are important, but it's important [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1166.82s)]
*  to stimulate dialogue with, you know, all parts of society. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1170.5s)]
*  I think many public policies, in fact, everywhere in the world, by the way, it's not [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1174.4199999999998s)]
*  in foreign policy, but also in domestic public policies, are sort of bottom, you know, top [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1179.54s)]
*  down policies. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1185.94s)]
*  They're not, you know, discussing details, et cetera. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1186.8999999999999s)]
*  So, you know, it takes time. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1190.74s)]
*  It takes energy, it takes education, it takes resources, it takes commitment to make a [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1193.06s)]
*  difference. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1205.54s)]
*  So, you know, truth is in nuance and success is in details, I would say. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1206.1s)]
*  So my advice, if I may, to answer your question, will be to spend time to understand the details, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1211.2199999999998s)]
*  the nuances of truth, the nuances of what's going on, because this is complex as all human [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1219.3799999999999s)]
*  beings, societies and communities. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1226.02s)]
*  And I think research is even more needed in this region, rather than just opinions and [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1228.02s)]
*  sort of at high level impressions and opinions that often guide policies. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1238.98s)]
*  So I would encourage deeper engagement, deeper commitment with the academic community, with [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1245.22s)]
*  the thinkers, with the youth, et cetera, before sort of... [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1252.34s)]
*  But there are intense relations with Morocco, so I will stop here, but it's not like there are no [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1256.82s)]
*  with Morocco, Morocco-US relations is a deep relation, multifaceted, with many dimensions. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1262.26s)]
*  We have actually a free trade agreement, so that gives an important framework and part [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1267.3799999999999s)]
*  of the benefit from the Millennium Challenge account support. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1273.2199999999998s)]
*  So... [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1280.1799999999998s)]
*  Great. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1284.02s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1284.34s)]
*  Yousef, to you. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1285.46s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1287.94s)]
*  Good afternoon. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1288.74s)]
*  I will stress on two points, actually. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1289.94s)]
*  One is democracy and one is climate change. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1292.98s)]
*  And I think these are the two major topics that the next administration, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1296.26s)]
*  the current administration may want to look at. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1300.66s)]
*  Democracy, because democracy is something primordial for the future of the region. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1304.66s)]
*  And democracy promotion gained momentum under Obama, but was largely neglected under Trump. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1310.18s)]
*  So there is an opportunity to reverse that. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1315.46s)]
*  And I think the way democracy promotion was treated in the last four years and the way [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1319.6200000000001s)]
*  actually events in Washington evolved, the way democracy was treated in Washington itself in [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1326.18s)]
*  the last four years, made many neutral observers in the region quite skeptical and confused. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1331.94s)]
*  So you have more and more people convinced that democracy for the US is just a tool of [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1343.3s)]
*  hegemony and that in the United States no one really cares about democracy, which is only [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1351.54s)]
*  partly true. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1358.74s)]
*  We know that a lot of people in the US do care about democracy and about democracy promotion. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1359.3s)]
*  So I think this is an important thing to take into consideration. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1363.1399999999999s)]
*  And one major step that the Biden administration should do is to raise the voice and to increase [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1368.4199999999998s)]
*  the messaging in defense of democratic norms in not only in North Africa, not only in Tunisia, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1376.6599999999999s)]
*  but in the world generally. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1384.82s)]
*  And I think from the few comments and statements I've been reading and listening to, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1387.78s)]
*  I think the Biden administration is already doing that. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1393.86s)]
*  But if they will continue, and actually if they continue, they may end up alienating [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1397.3s)]
*  all of America's allies. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1401.86s)]
*  So maybe one of the things that should be encouraged by the current administration, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1404.5s)]
*  be it through federal or congressional grants, is to encourage independent think tanks in [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1412.6599999999999s)]
*  Washington, in the US and American universities, American organizations, to work even more with [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1421.06s)]
*  democratic groups in North Africa, with activists in North Africa, to host more events, to [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1429.3s)]
*  allocate more funds for those who are defending democracy in North Africa in general. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1438.58s)]
*  And again, I mean, one major point that should be stressed, is that the messaging, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1444.82s)]
*  the pro-democracy messaging should continue from Washington, DC. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1453.46s)]
*  And in the same vein, I think one of the main important threats to democratic life, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1457.86s)]
*  be it in North Africa or in North America or anywhere else, is the spread of disinformation [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1463.78s)]
*  and conspiracy theories. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1470.26s)]
*  And some of it originates in China and Russia, some in Qatar and the UAE, and some in Washington, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1471.54s)]
*  DC and New York. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1478.34s)]
*  So countering this scourge requires a global effort that the US can lead, not least because [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1479.46s)]
*  of its leadership of the internet. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1487.3s)]
*  So this is the democracy part. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1490.6599999999999s)]
*  And very briefly, I'll move to the second part that I think the Biden administration [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1492.82s)]
*  should focus on, which is climate change and water scarcity and all these issues that are [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1498.18s)]
*  actually endangering life in North Africa. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1505.7s)]
*  And just like democracy is something that we need to nurture on the long term because [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1508.8200000000002s)]
*  we're building a new generation and if we're building or we're raising a new generation, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1518.1000000000001s)]
*  and if this generation is raised in democracy, then this generation will be the one [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1523.22s)]
*  defending democracy. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1528.1000000000001s)]
*  Similarly, when it comes to climate change and water scarcity and water issues, we're talking [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1529.54s)]
*  about something that is for the long term. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1536.26s)]
*  We see it happening more and more. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1540.58s)]
*  We see problems related to climate emerging and becoming more and more difficult to face [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1544.9s)]
*  in this part of the world, and in Tunisia or in Libya or in Morocco, Algeria and so on. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1552.82s)]
*  But also we see that on the same time, local politicians seem to worry more about their [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1559.54s)]
*  ephemeral political survival than about the survival of their countries and of their [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1567.78s)]
*  populations. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1575.1399999999999s)]
*  So here is one push that should be given from Washington, especially since the US rejoined [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1576.1s)]
*  the Paris climate agreement. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1582.9799999999998s)]
*  Maybe more programs and messaging again towards working on facing issues related to climate [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1585.4599999999998s)]
*  and water scarcity. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1595.2199999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1596.82s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1598.9799999999998s)]
*  I think climate is a really important issue that we don't focus as much time on as we [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1599.9399999999998s)]
*  should. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1605.46s)]
*  Hopefully with the appointment of Secretary Kerry as a climate envoy, there will be much [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1605.86s)]
*  more emphasis on this. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1609.86s)]
*  And to you, Nancy. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1611.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1613.54s)]
*  I very much agree with everything that Ambassador Robenstein and Yusuf and Karim said. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1614.74s)]
*  But I think just taking a step back, the US needs to make a shift in its strategy towards [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1620.66s)]
*  the Middle East in terms of focus, approach and distribution of resources. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1628.26s)]
*  And the first point about strategy, first of all, for so long, the US did not have a [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1634.9s)]
*  strategy towards the Middle East and have moved from this, from like having a holistic [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1641.54s)]
*  strategic approach towards the region into a transactional relationship. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1648.82s)]
*  The problem was transactional relationship between the US and countries in North Africa [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1653.54s)]
*  and the Middle East, not only that it is not impactful, it's not sustainable and short [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1660.34s)]
*  sighted, but also this kind of dynamic creates an incentive for those governments to actually [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1665.9399999999998s)]
*  take adversarial positions that would then bring them a place of negotiation to gain [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1673.62s)]
*  more sources or strategic position with the United States. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1681.78s)]
*  And actually, this leads to a regressive position, for example, like taking positions [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1687.38s)]
*  and signaling that there is a close relationship with North Africa, with North Korea. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1693.8600000000001s)]
*  And then based on that, there will be a negotiation over aid or by arresting American citizens or [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1701.38s)]
*  families of American citizens. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1709.3000000000002s)]
*  And this kind of transactional relationship actually is more damaging. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1711.46s)]
*  And it's not just like that it's not long term, it's not sustainable. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1718.9s)]
*  And actually reached a point under the Trump administration that it became like a quick [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1722.58s)]
*  pro quo, not just transactional, it's just like very narrow, narrowly focused. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1727.46s)]
*  The second thing about the distribution of resources, the financing or the translation [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1732.5s)]
*  of policy into finance is highly skewed towards military and security policies. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1740.1s)]
*  There's a recent report by Iran that showed that 50% of military aid that the US gives [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1746.98s)]
*  goes to the Middle East. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1754.5s)]
*  And even like within this territory, it's further skewed where 81% of FMF, which is [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1756.6599999999999s)]
*  like foreign military financing, 81% goes to Egypt, Jordan and Israel alone. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1763.78s)]
*  This creates a situation where you're transferring arm, transferring military support [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1771.3799999999999s)]
*  that fuels the conflict, where at the same time, you also treat each country differently [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1779.22s)]
*  and separately and isolation from the other. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1787.7s)]
*  And that's problematic because it's very difficult within North Africa in particular [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1790.5s)]
*  to deal with those countries separately. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1795.46s)]
*  For example, the report that you're referring to Sarah points out that 70% of the Tunisians, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1797.94s)]
*  the Jihadi Tunisians that were arrested were trained in Libya. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1805.0600000000002s)]
*  And that's just a simple example. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1808.98s)]
*  I mean, there are more profound issues with the dealing with countries in isolation. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1810.98s)]
*  Now, adding to that, that there is no strict AUC, which is like end user certification [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1817.3799999999999s)]
*  for arms, you may end up, and this is actually happening, transferring arms that goes into [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1823.54s)]
*  the hand to those who are actually fighting the interest of the United States or the allies [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1829.78s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1835.9399999999998s)]
*  So this needs to have a restructuring within the defense strategy itself and in terms of [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1837.3s)]
*  resources. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1844.58s)]
*  And when we talk about resources shifting more resources to the energy, the economy [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1845.22s)]
*  and the trade with the region. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1851.22s)]
*  Now, we could do that. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1854.26s)]
*  I mean, in terms of providing more economic support to the region, particularly as we [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1856.34s)]
*  see China and Russia are highly investing in the region. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1863.78s)]
*  And it's not just in terms of the volume of resources. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1869.3799999999999s)]
*  They have signed like billion dollars agreements with Saudi Arabia and other countries in the [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1874.1s)]
*  region. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1881.78s)]
*  But they're also picking their focus. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1882.34s)]
*  They're focusing on trade, focusing on strategic issues, like, for example, the Belt Road and [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1886.1799999999998s)]
*  energy in particular. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1892.74s)]
*  For example, Egypt signed an agreement with Rusnano, which is like a nanotechnology agency [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1894.02s)]
*  that is affiliated to the government in order to help Egypt in building the devices for [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1900.66s)]
*  water salinization. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1909.22s)]
*  So they know exactly where the weak points, the strategic point, and they focus on it. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1911.0600000000002s)]
*  And I think the US needs to pay attention to this, not just in terms of competition [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1917.0600000000002s)]
*  with China and Russia. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1923.0600000000002s)]
*  And I think actually the US needs to step away from the Cold War mentality because [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1924.18s)]
*  the configuration of the dynamics in the region has highly changed. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1931.0600000000002s)]
*  But then giving more economic aid to countries in the Middle East that are highly [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1935.46s)]
*  authoritarian, mostly, without focusing on governance reform, structural adjustment, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1942.18s)]
*  and anti-corruption mechanisms, this kind of pouring money into the region will not [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1950.66s)]
*  actually have any positive impact, particularly with the issue of anti-corruption. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1959.38s)]
*  And if you notice, particularly the protests and uprisings that happened in 2019, in September, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1966.5s)]
*  in Egypt, in Lebanon, in Algeria, the key issue was there was corruption. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1975.7800000000002s)]
*  And corruption was the trigger of those protests. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1984.8200000000002s)]
*  Now, that in itself is a point to highlight the importance of the issue, but it also points [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1988.9s)]
*  to the fragility of those governments. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=1998.18s)]
*  Why? [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2001.22s)]
*  Because over the past 10 years or the Arab Spring, the main keywords were freedom, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2001.8600000000001s)]
*  dignity, and just like all the different human rights issues, yes, it's like in the [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2008.98s)]
*  different slogans. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2016.5s)]
*  And that helped the narrative of those governments to claim that even if we consider [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2017.7s)]
*  those protesters are not agents and they have pure and sincere objectives, they are only [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2024.3400000000001s)]
*  calling for sort of a luxury demands, freedom of expression, sexuality, whereas those [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2030.5800000000002s)]
*  governments claim that they are concerned with putting bread on the table of the citizens. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2038.42s)]
*  Now, when those protests at heart actually is addressing corruption, that hits the narrative [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2044.5s)]
*  in its heart and it shows the fragility of those governments. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2052.58s)]
*  So in order to do that, we need to focus on government institutional restructuring and [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2056.58s)]
*  support. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2065.06s)]
*  And the most important thing is that the U.S. does not have to act alone unilaterally or [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2066.02s)]
*  reinvent the wheel. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2071.54s)]
*  The U.S. would benefit more from joining and working through multilateral frameworks, for [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2072.74s)]
*  example, like the SDG 16, the Sustainable Development Goals, the goal number 16, which [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2079.7s)]
*  is peace, justice, and strong institutions. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2086.8999999999996s)]
*  And working together through that framework will enhance the ability of the U.S. to actually [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2090.2599999999998s)]
*  have an influence and reclaim its position as a powerful leader or actor in the region. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2097.7799999999997s)]
*  Wonderful. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2105.9399999999996s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2109.9399999999996s)]
*  So this idea of I want to pick up on this idea of geopolitics, both from the idea of [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2111.2999999999997s)]
*  kind of the U.S. versus Russia, China, Nancy, I think you put it well to step away from [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2116.8199999999997s)]
*  the Cold War mentality, but also there's a question in the chat regarding what this [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2121.46s)]
*  person calls medium power interventionism in North Africa, especially Turkey, UAE, and [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2127.78s)]
*  Qatar, and Libya. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2135.94s)]
*  And so I'm curious, maybe I'll start with you, Youssef, on this, what your thoughts are on how [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2137.2200000000003s)]
*  the United States could play a constructive role, either on the sort of broader stage vis-a-vis [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2143.14s)]
*  Russia and China, but also on the sort of the middle-sized powers here, working particularly [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2148.5s)]
*  in Libya, but in other cases in the region as well. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2156.18s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2158.26s)]
*  So I'll attempt to play a comparative game. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2158.9s)]
*  Look at how the EU and the U.S. reacted to Russia's spoiling of the democratic process [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2166.18s)]
*  or the Europeanization of places like Ukraine or Georgia or Belarus. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2175.62s)]
*  Look at that major effort that was taken against Russia. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2184.58s)]
*  Then look at how the EU and the Europeans and the Americans are dealing with the UAE, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2189.7s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey, and how they are doing in the MENA region, which itself [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2198.34s)]
*  went through its own wave of democratization in the last 10 years. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2207.78s)]
*  And some people would call it its wave of liberal democracy, its entrance into the [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2215.7000000000003s)]
*  mold of liberal democracy. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2224.5800000000004s)]
*  The U.S. and the EU barely confronted these medium-sized spoilers, or these regional [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2226.5s)]
*  spoilers. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2234.66s)]
*  Why? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2235.54s)]
*  Because they are allies in different arenas, unlike Russia or China. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2235.86s)]
*  And this is why I'm very skeptical when I read or hear about the global competition [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2243.54s)]
*  between the U.S. and China and Russia in North Africa, because so far, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2249.7s)]
*  North Africa has been spared by the games of the Cold War, unlike most of Asia or most of [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2254.98s)]
*  Sub-Saharan Africa or Latin America. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2263.14s)]
*  And I'm worried that we're now witnessing all of a sudden the awakening of global powers [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2266.58s)]
*  competition in North Africa, while in North Africa, for instance, the spoilers of democracy, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2274.58s)]
*  are American and European allies. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2282.6600000000003s)]
*  And for most of the post-colonial history of North African states, yes, Russia did support [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2285.86s)]
*  Libya and Algeria, but the U.S. and European countries supported the other dictatorships [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2293.06s)]
*  in the region. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2301.2200000000003s)]
*  So this is, I think, now with the Biden administration, there is a chance for a renewal [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2302.7400000000002s)]
*  of U.S. strategy towards the region. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2310.34s)]
*  Thankfully, at different positions, there are people who we know and who are, let's say, [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2313.7000000000003s)]
*  the less hawkish part of the U.S. administration, and we're watching all these confirmations in [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2322.58s)]
*  recent days. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2331.54s)]
*  So hopefully, there will be a renewal of U.S. policy towards the region, but hopefully, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2332.1800000000003s)]
*  the renewal will be towards maybe more cooperation, maybe more focus on things that are [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2337.78s)]
*  essential both to the American people but also to the peoples of North Africa than on [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2348.1000000000004s)]
*  pure geostrategic and realist goals that may benefit the U.S. but will probably harm [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2354.42s)]
*  the peoples of the region. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2362.9s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2363.94s)]
*  Nancy or Karim, do either of you want to come in on the geopolitics question? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2367.86s)]
*  I, again, like I agree with Yousef, but we need also to consider the lens through which [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2374.18s)]
*  the U.S. looks at the Middle East. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2382.42s)]
*  And this has been a problem for decades and actually particularly got exacerbated [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2384.42s)]
*  by the Obama administration where in 2008, he had a speech in Cairo, which sort of sets [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2393.94s)]
*  the framework, which is more of like in a way friendly, inclusive, and accepting the [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2403.3s)]
*  region and embracing it. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2413.78s)]
*  But the problem with that and the problem with a long history of the U.S. and other [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2417.38s)]
*  European countries dealing with the Middle East is looking at it from the lens of a [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2424.42s)]
*  socio-cultural group that the essentialization of the region as a region that has like [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2429.86s)]
*  special characteristics mainly defined by religion and tradition and seeing those like [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2440.34s)]
*  the people of the Middle East as those groups who are like confined and defined in this way, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2447.2200000000003s)]
*  as opposed to dealing with the region as a group of nation states and the people there as citizens [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2454.26s)]
*  with rights because that changes the dynamic dramatically looking at these are countries and [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2461.3s)]
*  citizens who have economic and political interests in the same way that the U.S. and Europe [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2467.46s)]
*  dealing with the rest of the region. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2476.42s)]
*  So that view of and although the Obama speech in 2008 is like had like a good faith approach [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2478.18s)]
*  and a positive approach is actually highly problematic because it's used the regions [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2489.7s)]
*  only and exclusively through that level. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2495.7s)]
*  Thank you. A question for you, Kareem. There's one here in the chat and I'm going to add onto [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2498.8199999999997s)]
*  it a little bit too, which is do you believe the recent position of the Trump administration on [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2507.62s)]
*  the issue of Western Sahara has blocked the future development and cooperation between [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2511.9399999999996s)]
*  North African countries and should it be revised? And as you know, there's a push in some by some [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2516.5s)]
*  members of the U.S. Congress to reverse that U.S. recognition of Western Sahara as autonomous. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2522.98s)]
*  So I'm sorry, as part of Morocco. So I'm curious what you think about what the U.S. position should [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2529.38s)]
*  be. Should the U.S. take a more hands on approach towards this conflict? This is an area the U.S. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2534.7400000000002s)]
*  had mostly stayed out of until really the very end of the Trump administration. How do you think [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2539.94s)]
*  the Biden administration should approach the issue of Western Sahara? [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2545.3s)]
*  Well, I think it's a very sort of specific question within the framework of this discussion. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2548.34s)]
*  As a Moroccan, I think it's a good news. It's only a sort of justice in the long run, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2556.18s)]
*  looking at it in the historical long run. I mean, there's a good knowledge about [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2564.98s)]
*  the situation and how our neighbor is sort of instrumentalizing this situation. So I think [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2572.42s)]
*  the current administration should stick to the good news that we got at the end of [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2583.46s)]
*  the Trump administration. I think it's also to put in perspective with the [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2590.02s)]
*  perspective with the approach more with Israel and other dynamics that are ongoing. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2596.26s)]
*  But I would like to be more. I think the point I made earlier on is very important. Back in the [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2604.26s)]
*  early 60s, the U.S. sent many PhD students, many students doing their PhDs on the region. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2611.6200000000003s)]
*  It was a great knowledge of the region. And it brings also humility. I think concepts such [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2619.22s)]
*  as democracy, we all believe in the parameters of democracy, but there are various ways people want [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2628.8199999999997s)]
*  to organize themselves. This may be too short to get into this kind of discussions, but there's [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2637.06s)]
*  also nations of spirits. They have history. They have souls. They speak for Morocco. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2645.86s)]
*  They self-organize in ways in centuries. There are good reasons for that. If you take monarchy in [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2653.3s)]
*  Morocco, it's not something that has been parachuted from somewhere. It's been here for [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2660.1s)]
*  12 centuries. There are good reasons. Moroccans are attached to it. So again, when you ask me [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2666.82s)]
*  what an administration should be, I think cyclicity is bad in international politics, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2674.34s)]
*  that I can tell you. I think unpredictability and changes, abrupt changes in your policies [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2678.9s)]
*  toward a specific region is problematic, like it is in economics. So again, I would say intense [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2689.2200000000003s)]
*  dialogue at all levels. I think Youssef mentioned academia and science and the younger generation. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2698.58s)]
*  I think Tunisia is, of course, its own challenge. I think we all have challenges. I would recommend [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2705.86s)]
*  light touch policies and dialogue and listening to the population rather than superimposing [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2717.86s)]
*  decisions and tit for tat politics, like the question you just asked me, which I may wonder [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2724.34s)]
*  who asked this question, but I have an idea. I don't think these are sort of zero-sum games. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2731.6200000000003s)]
*  The Westphalian definition of nations, we sit within our borders like you in the US. I think [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2743.78s)]
*  the region has the same kind of being here, being existing and being defined as a nation, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2750.7400000000002s)]
*  not just bizarre constructions that you can chop from the outside and then get a response. I think [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2764.82s)]
*  it's much more complex than that. So I think that's what I've been working on over the past couple [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2772.34s)]
*  of years. We should acknowledge the complexity of public policy upfront. And as I said, again, [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2777.86s)]
*  listening, studying. So if you want to take an initiative, it takes energy, it takes time, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2785.78s)]
*  it takes investment, it takes long-term commitment, it takes details, it takes [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2790.98s)]
*  attention to details like Nancy mentioned. And the world is important. The signaling is important, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2799.94s)]
*  expectation builds around that. So it's very complex. That would be my message. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2809.1400000000003s)]
*  And there are institutions that can help do that, like ours. When I see the bibliographical [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2817.7000000000003s)]
*  reference of your report, I don't see many of what we do as a think tank. And we publish 200 [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2825.86s)]
*  pieces a year. It's not about not being quoted, but I don't see much on the region [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2833.6200000000003s)]
*  coming from scholars. I mean, there's a wealth of research here being made. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2842.6600000000003s)]
*  So my recommendation, just don't look at the region and it would be true for elsewhere from [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2849.3s)]
*  too much from outside. Connect inside and go much deeper. It's the same on the question you asked me [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2856.1s)]
*  about our southern provinces. I mean, this is just for us, the recent evolution is a great [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2867.38s)]
*  evolution. It should be reinforced and it just makes sense in historical terms for [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2876.66s)]
*  for Moroccans. So I think it's also maybe putting pressure on our neighbors also to accept this and [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2884.66s)]
*  to make sure we have a sort of exit on the positive one that will also allow us to reconnect [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2891.62s)]
*  much deeper with Tunisia, etc. But in any case, it's not what would be my recommendation, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2901.86s)]
*  I would say. So repeating a little bit my first point in a way. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2912.26s)]
*  Thank you. The question for you, Yousef, which is that, you know, there's no secret the United [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2917.46s)]
*  States is sort of going through its own reckoning with regard to our democracy. And I'm curious how [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2922.7400000000002s)]
*  this is perceived in Tunisia. Does the challenges the United States is facing, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2928.34s)]
*  does that diminish the US ability to support Tunisia's democratic transition? And sort of [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2934.02s)]
*  relatedly, are there lessons from Tunisia's experience that you think the United States [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2938.7400000000002s)]
*  could learn from? You much more recently have gone through a very, very difficult period as well of [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2943.6200000000003s)]
*  polarization and having to kind of put things back on track. What lessons would you have for US [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2950.02s)]
*  domestic policymakers on kind of fixing our own democracy as well? [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2955.54s)]
*  So on the perception, I think, yes, that the whenever you talk to Tunisian politicians or [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2959.7s)]
*  observers or, or citizens who are not very interested in international politics, but to [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2968.82s)]
*  watch the news, there is always the, you know, that question mark about US democracy. And, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2974.98s)]
*  and you know, I mean, something that is very interesting that happened, a lot of the conspiracy [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2983.86s)]
*  theories that that we were confronting on a daily basis here were confirmed by the former US [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2990.26s)]
*  president. So in a way, yes, that what happened in the US impacted the image of the United States [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=2997.14s)]
*  as a democracy and as a democracy that can give lessons to the world. But this doesn't mean that [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3005.78s)]
*  Tunisia can give lessons to the United States. I think each country goes through its own [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3015.0600000000004s)]
*  process and its own polarization. So yes, it's true that Tunisia went through a polarization and [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3021.86s)]
*  then went out of that polarization, but then it entered into a new form of polarization and an [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3027.1400000000003s)]
*  even worse political crisis afterwards. So I don't think that the Tunisian lesson is necessarily [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3032.9s)]
*  a good one for the US. However, for sure, when we look at 2013 in Tunisia, the fact that the main [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3039.38s)]
*  leaders, the main protagonists sat together and reached a minimal agreement and started discussing [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3050.34s)]
*  with each other rather than cursing each other via different media outlets, that helped decrease [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3059.7s)]
*  the tension a little bit. So this is perhaps something that that American politicians can do. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3066.8999999999996s)]
*  But I think, again, this is this cannot be a recipe and each country goes through its own [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3074.66s)]
*  issues and finds its own solution. And I think, again, for the US, there are a lot of challenges, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3082.98s)]
*  but also there are a lot of thinkers and mediators who can solve the current polarization. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3088.58s)]
*  Thank you. And a question for you, Nancy. There has been some hope that the Biden [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3098.34s)]
*  administration will pay much more attention to human rights issues in Egypt than the Trump [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3104.18s)]
*  administration. And I'm curious how you assess where things are so far. We're only a month into [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3108.1s)]
*  the administration, but we've already seen, I would say, some positive and negative on that front [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3114.02s)]
*  coming from the administration sort of seems a little bit like status quo. So what do you think, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3118.98s)]
*  you know, what should what approach should the Biden administration take? Do you think the [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3124.66s)]
*  expectations are misplaced that we will see a real shift towards more of a human rights based [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3128.58s)]
*  approach in Egypt? Well, in terms of discourse, of course, like the statements coming from the [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3133.38s)]
*  Biden administration from Joe Biden himself and like the secretary of state are all encouraging, [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3141.06s)]
*  like spelling out the support of the of human rights, particularly from the phone call with [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3148.1s)]
*  then the foreign minister of Egypt, Samer Shoukri yesterday that highlighted the importance of [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3156.18s)]
*  human rights and democracy. And that should be sort of like the terms of engagement and [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3164.18s)]
*  including in any partnership with Egypt. Now, this is great. And it's it's a huge shift from [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3170.42s)]
*  Trump and his favorite dictator. However, this needs to translate into action and otherwise. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3178.82s)]
*  And I would just like to differ a little bit from the statement that Ambassador [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3187.86s)]
*  Rubenstein said at the beginning that there needs to be moral support to the people in the region. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3193.3s)]
*  I agree in principle, but moral support and empty words only have an adversarial effect [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3200.18s)]
*  and undermines the influence and credibility of the United States. So, for example, when you see [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3207.06s)]
*  such statements coming out and meanwhile, and at the same time, you see the missile transfers [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3213.7s)]
*  and arms transfers from the US to Egypt, it just gives conflicting signals out there. And looking [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3219.7799999999997s)]
*  at it as like dealing separately from them and looking at things like it's like American citizens [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3229.86s)]
*  who are being harassed outside of of the Egypt, even those who are abroad that we're seeing, like [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3237.3s)]
*  with Mohammed Sultan and Sharif Mansour and the Tkotem al-Khatib, those are three people who are [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3249.2200000000003s)]
*  outside of the US. I mean, like the Tkotem is in Europe, but their families are being harassed, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3256.1s)]
*  detained and intimidated all the time. So when you see this happening at the same time, while [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3262.74s)]
*  we're continuing with the arms transfer to Egypt, for example, but that goes for other countries as [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3269.62s)]
*  well, this is highly problematic. And I think it just it's important to translate this into both [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3277.2999999999997s)]
*  even the set out and and sort of publicized strategy and into resources as well. And if you [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3285.38s)]
*  just like take a step back and look at the last two QDRs, the QDRs like a quadrennial defense review, [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3294.7400000000002s)]
*  which is the report that is issued every four years that defines the strategy, the defense strategy [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3303.78s)]
*  of the US. When you see that there is like a clear statement that says the deprioritizing [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3309.7799999999997s)]
*  the Middle East and focusing more on China and Russia, I mean, like even if that's the case, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3317.8599999999997s)]
*  but seeing that is translated into declining and decreasing support to the region means that this [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3324.66s)]
*  region is seen by the US exactly in the same way as the authoritarian leaders see citizens [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3333.3s)]
*  and the people there as just a liability or a threat does not differ at all from the vision of [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3341.2200000000003s)]
*  authoritarian leaders that there and this is highly problematic because when you do [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3348.82s)]
*  view the region in that way as a threat, and the the the latter like the most recent one is [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3355.8599999999997s)]
*  highlighting that this is a problem that needs to be contained. And how is that translated into [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3363.54s)]
*  resources, the more resources goes into border control that has actually tripled over the past [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3369.62s)]
*  years in both from Europe and from the United States. So all these like slogans and positive [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3376.74s)]
*  discourse and hopeful one, of course, like it's a great departure from the position of Trump [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3385.22s)]
*  administration, but having that without translating this both into political positions, [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3392.66s)]
*  resources and approach to dealing with with the different countries in the region, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3399.94s)]
*  Egypt and other countries, I think it will will undermine the credibility and influence of the [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3406.82s)]
*  United States and that needs to change. Thank you. We are just about out of time, but I wanted to [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3413.7s)]
*  throw hopefully we can get quick answers on this one question. We haven't talked about the COVID-19 [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3420.5s)]
*  pandemic at all. And I'm curious, I know, for example, Morocco seems to be doing very, very [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3425.62s)]
*  well in fighting the pandemic. And I'm curious what maybe, Kareem, if you could talk a little bit [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3431.14s)]
*  about Morocco's response, and if there is any coordination across North Africa in addressing [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3435.22s)]
*  the pandemic and vaccine distribution, but also just in sort of, you know, fighting through [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3440.3399999999997s)]
*  healthcare tools and other things. And is there a role for the United States to help in addressing [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3445.7s)]
*  the pandemic that it seems like we will be facing still for quite a while in the future? [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3450.42s)]
*  Kareem. For some reason, we can't hear you. Can you try just, it says you're unmuted, but [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3455.06s)]
*  I can't try again. No. Is it better now? Yes, perfect. Thank you. Okay, sorry. I'm saying we've [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3465.14s)]
*  vaccinated 10% of the population. Actually, I myself been vaccinated, although I'm under 60. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3473.86s)]
*  But as a professor at the university, so we've vaccinated people at universities above 45. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3481.62s)]
*  And in the population, we've just reached 60, the age of 60. So currently going on, it's about 3 [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3489.7799999999997s)]
*  million and something people's been managed quite well. It's, I mean, you know, it's both sort of [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3497.46s)]
*  a commitment, important commitment from the highest level of government, but also, [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3506.58s)]
*  and also, of course, an organizational matter. So Morocco is a pretty well organized [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3513.38s)]
*  countries with region with an administrative, you know, backbone and with, you know, decentralized, [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3521.22s)]
*  the concentrated components of government. So it's been managed at the organizational level by [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3529.94s)]
*  the Ministry of Interior that has a very tight and is being all across the country. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3536.26s)]
*  But, you know, we've been also taking this very seriously from day one. So the king has been [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3545.46s)]
*  involved himself in pushing for serious management of this crisis. I'm not aware of [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3552.1s)]
*  cooperation across North Africa. I'm not a specialist of this topic. But I think one of [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3563.06s)]
*  the lessons we can draw already, and we've been publishing on that is that you need a functioning [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3569.94s)]
*  state. I mean, we tend to forget about that, but it's important to have an efficient state. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3577.86s)]
*  You know, of course, we can discuss what it means, but at least that can deliver to populations, [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3585.06s)]
*  you know, basic, you know, services like health, education, etc. And it's in a way, there's a sort [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3591.06s)]
*  of return of the social state responding to the demand for protection from population. There's [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3599.54s)]
*  an important demand for protection all around the world. And some countries have been delivering [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3607.06s)]
*  better than others. I have to acknowledge that I'm not very well aware of what's been going on [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3613.86s)]
*  elsewhere. But what I can tell you is that it's been this is what, you know, the sort of early [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3619.46s)]
*  lessons we've been drawing on this. And of course, an important impact on the economy, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3628.02s)]
*  Solidarity Fund that has allowed to gather about three percentage points of GDP, [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3636.98s)]
*  voluntary contributions from all parts of the nations, companies, people, [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3644.42s)]
*  wage earners that has also allowed to have a strong response, including, of course, [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3651.7799999999997s)]
*  vaccination, which is free, by the way, everybody that is living in Morocco, including foreigners [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3658.02s)]
*  living in Morocco are getting vaccinated. Thank you so much. And I know we could talk about this, [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3663.94s)]
*  all these questions for hours, I think, and I apologize to those in the comments who we did [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3671.62s)]
*  not get to your question. But please join me virtually. It's hard to thank people virtually, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3676.42s)]
*  but in thanking our panelists, Yusuf, Nancy and Kareem, I think this has been a really [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3681.54s)]
*  great discussion. And as I said, there's much, much more we could get into. But I hope we'll [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3685.78s)]
*  have the chance to speak again. And I hope that we'll have the chance to see each other in person [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3690.5s)]
*  at some point in the next year, two years. Thank you so much. And everyone enjoyed the rest of your [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3694.9s)]
*  day. Thank you. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj5g1OR7gI&t=3700.1s)]
