# Opening Remarks and Economic Challenges and Governance: Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Palestine
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [September 07, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc)
*  the president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and I'm very pleased [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=0.0s)]
*  to welcome all of you to Carnegie and to today's conference. I'm especially pleased to co-host [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4.48s)]
*  today's conversation with Mike McFaul, Frank Fukuyama, Larry Diamond, and their remarkable [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  colleagues at Stanford University's Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=15.44s)]
*  Law. Although we come from opposite coasts, we share a mission to bring scholarship to [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=20.0s)]
*  bear on some of the world's most pressing challenges. We also share an admiration for [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=25.88s)]
*  Amr Hamzawi, a remarkable and courageous Egyptian scholar and activist. We're thrilled to have [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  shared Amr for a number of years, and I want to thank him for bringing our two institutions [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=36.64s)]
*  together again. And finally, let me thank our distinguished guests and panelists for [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=41.94s)]
*  being here today. I know it was a long journey for a number of you, and it means a great [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  deal to all of us to have the chance to listen to you and to learn from you. To state the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=52.08s)]
*  blindingly obvious, the Middle East has bedeviled generations of American policymakers. It's [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  a region that embodies the powerful political, economic, and social currents reshaping today's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=64.2s)]
*  international landscape. Sectarianism, authoritarianism, populism, and extremism are centrifugal forces [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=69.64s)]
*  pulling this region apart and leaving in their wake the kind of instability and human tragedy [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=77.28s)]
*  that we haven't seen since the establishment of modern Arab states after the First World [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=83.56s)]
*  War. We face no shortage of crises in this part of the world, from the devastating war [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=88.12s)]
*  in Syria to the geopolitical clash in the Gulf, and from Tunisia's vulnerable transition [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=93.72s)]
*  to the increasingly fragile nuclear agreement with Iran, to name just a few. These and other [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=99.52s)]
*  headline issues understandably demand our attention and deserve thoughtful debate. But [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=105.84s)]
*  it's also important to look beyond today's tumult to the long-term trajectory of this [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=111.44s)]
*  region, its people, and its place in the world, and to draw the right implications for U.S. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=116.44s)]
*  policy. This has been the focus of our Arab Horizons Project at Carnegie, of a lot of [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=122.44s)]
*  terrific work at Stanford, and it's certainly the focus of today's conference. The test [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=127.84s)]
*  before governments from Morocco to Saudi Arabia is finding a governance structure and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=132.88s)]
*  a compact that can provide their people with security, prosperity, and dignity. This is [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=138.2s)]
*  obviously easier said than done, and it's a relationship that will inevitably vary across [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=144.32s)]
*  societies. But it's a task no leader or country in the region can escape. Those that address [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=149.68s)]
*  those challenges thoughtfully and honestly ultimately become healthier and more stable [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=156.72s)]
*  places. Those that don't often become brittle and break. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=162.04000000000002s)]
*  We're very fortunate to have the chance over the course of today to hear from leading experts [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=166.68s)]
*  from the region about how specific security and economic challenges across six different [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=171.06s)]
*  country case studies relate to governance structure and strategies. At the same time, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=176.32s)]
*  we'll look to draw lessons from other regions that have undergone their own turmoil and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=182.28s)]
*  reexamination and see what lessons apply to today's Middle East. Finally, we'll turn to [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=187.72s)]
*  the question of U.S. policy and lessons learned from senior policy makers in both Republican [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=193.24s)]
*  and Democratic administrations. Many of us learned those lessons the hard way and came [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=198.6s)]
*  by whatever wisdom we acquired with lots of mistakes and scars along the way. So let me [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=204.04s)]
*  conclude by again extending my warm welcome to all of you and to all of today's panelists [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=210.04000000000002s)]
*  and my thanks once again to our Stanford colleagues for another terrific collaboration. And let [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=215.24s)]
*  me now turn to Dr. Lisa Blades to launch our first panel discussion. Thank you. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=220.72s)]
*  So it is my great pleasure to be the moderator of our first panel, which is focused on the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=231.52s)]
*  subject of economic prosperity in the Arab world. So as all of you know, the deep sources [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=236.44s)]
*  of economic inequality in the Arab region were a major source of frustration, particularly [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=242.88s)]
*  for young people across the many countries of the MENA region. So today we're going to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=248.64s)]
*  be talking a little bit about the state of economic affairs in three major cases with [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=253.04s)]
*  experts from Tunisia, Palestine, and Saudi Arabia. So I'd like to start by asking our [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=258.2s)]
*  panelists to begin by discussing the state of the economy in each of their respective [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=265.2s)]
*  country cases since 2011 to get a sense of to what extent were the economic conditions, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  the sort of blocked economic frustrations of people across the region, are these still [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=275.68s)]
*  salient concerns and what is the changing nature of the economic situation that might [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=280.28s)]
*  lead us to consider some new political and economic acts on the ground. So Olfa, I thought [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=284.96s)]
*  we would start with you to begin by talking about the case in Tunisia. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=290.20000000000005s)]
*  Thank you. Hello and good morning, everyone. Tunisia's political and economy environment [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=295.20000000000005s)]
*  was highly centralized. This was before the revolution, which was both a strength and [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=303.36s)]
*  a weakness for the government. It was the context that governance problems worsened [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=309.04s)]
*  during the last decades, and especially the areas of corruption, government effectiveness, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=315.64s)]
*  and accountability. What we have to do as a member of parliament and the new government [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=320.64s)]
*  in place is to shape better policies, more efficient, and essentially to decentralize, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=327.64s)]
*  to make sure that distribution and the chair of distribution will be equitable for everyone [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=333.24s)]
*  and the access of citizens to this prosperity. Democratization empowers the citizens' rights [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=339.36s)]
*  and improves the governance. Essentially, one of the pillars is the access to information [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=346.12s)]
*  to be sure that the data on public finance will be okay. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=350.68s)]
*  One of the problems in economy was the recession registrant after the revolution, essentially [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=356.0s)]
*  with the terrorism attack, tourism collapse, budget deficit, high raise up, the rate of [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=364.0s)]
*  unemployment, unemployment of youths, essentially on women, on girls, on high skilled students, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=372.28s)]
*  and third, how to spend the resources of the government. It's a problem of taxation, it's [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=382.52s)]
*  a problem of fiscal equity, and what about the public services, education, health, transport, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=390.47999999999996s)]
*  and infrastructure? One of the major reforms is how to switch from the public investments [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=398.88s)]
*  to private investments. By passing the law of public-private partnership, it was one [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=407.15999999999997s)]
*  of the pillars to shape it, to shape the policy for decentralization to give the autonomy [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=415.16s)]
*  of every region and not to focus only on coastal area, but to go everywhere. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=422.92s)]
*  One and more important is how to create jobs, how to create jobs for youth. The access of [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=434.44000000000005s)]
*  finance for social and youth entrepreneurship, this is what the government today is looking [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=442.44s)]
*  for, with the fighting of anti-corruption to make sure that the good governance will be [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=449.44s)]
*  implemented everywhere in public institutions. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=454.44s)]
*  Mudar Kassis from Beers 8 University, professor of philosophy, will talk about the Palestinian [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=459.44s)]
*  case. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=466.56s)]
*  Good morning. Well, you see, in Palestine, there was hardly a case, really. Let me just [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=467.71999999999997s)]
*  give a few things of how I personally sort of got myself acquainted with our economy. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=479.44s)]
*  Back in the 90s, right after the Oslo agreements and the peace process started, whenever it [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=486.68s)]
*  started, the Palestinian GNP per capita was in the order of $2,000 in the early 90s per [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=493.36s)]
*  year. In Jordan, it was something like $700 at that time, I think so, something in that [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=504.40000000000003s)]
*  order. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=512.6800000000001s)]
*  And then we move sort of with this sort of promise of Hong Kong of the Middle East, I [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=514.04s)]
*  think it was called, sorry, Singapore of the Middle East. And everybody is sort of, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=521.04s)]
*  you know, looking forward to get better jobs, better income, what have you. And things started [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=531.9599999999999s)]
*  sort of moving around up to 96, 97 maybe, and then they suddenly stopped with some political [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=538.64s)]
*  turmoil, quite local. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=545.16s)]
*  And then we got the 2000 Intifada, where we dwindled back from 2000 down to probably 1200, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=549.24s)]
*  I think, or 1100 maybe. In the meantime, Jordan has exceeded us, Egypt has went much higher. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=557.04s)]
*  I mean, probably Yemen is still below the Palestinian GNP per capita in the region. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=565.0s)]
*  Syria is, of course, still lower, and then we got stuck there. We barely made it back [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=573.0s)]
*  by now, till the 2000 threshold. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=579.4s)]
*  Now if you look at, so I asked one of the industrialists in Palestine one time, I said, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=584.48s)]
*  look, you bought this factory, you sacked 105 employees and the laborers, et cetera, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=590.68s)]
*  you made it into storage and you're importing chocolates from Turkey, where they were used [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=597.68s)]
*  to be done locally. So what's the point of, you keep talking about developing the economy. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=603.3199999999999s)]
*  And he said, look, as long as water and energy are much higher in price in Palestine than [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=609.76s)]
*  they are in Jordan, Syria, Turkey, Egypt, et cetera, it will never be feasible to produce [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=617.8399999999999s)]
*  anything. Import is the only way out. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=623.28s)]
*  And import means, in this case, is that we will be more and more aid dependent. The amount [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=626.76s)]
*  or the percentage of international aid in our sort of general budget is, I mean, they [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=633.88s)]
*  claim it's going down, but as a matter of fact, what's going down is the standard of [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=642.4s)]
*  living together with international aid, but it's not about really getting a more local [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=647.56s)]
*  or national component to the economy. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=654.0799999999999s)]
*  The reason why I went this way to describe the economy is that, of course, it is never [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=658.28s)]
*  fair to describe anything in Palestine as Palestinian because the Israeli occupation [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=663.64s)]
*  is overwhelming. I mean, it controls everything. It controls the borders, it controls the trade. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=669.04s)]
*  We cannot have our own taxation regulations, especially in relation to commerce, like import [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=675.24s)]
*  and export, and so on and so forth. But then to keep, I mean, and it's important to get [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=682.36s)]
*  rid of the occupation. I mean, it's crucial. We will not be able really to move anywhere [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=689.88s)]
*  in the current situation. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=695.08s)]
*  But the serious question is, OK, suppose we do that tomorrow. Suppose there is no occupation [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=698.08s)]
*  the next morning. Where will be the economy, and not only the economy, where will we be [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=704.52s)]
*  heading? And I think that we will find ourselves in layers and layers of problems and sophistications [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=711.88s)]
*  that this sort of old, good old dream of the Palestinians being more susceptible and more [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=719.64s)]
*  interested and more inclined to democracy and human rights protection, et cetera, because [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=726.96s)]
*  of many, many factors. The diaspora is one of them, the sort of traditions of political [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=731.64s)]
*  work in the exile in various atmospheres, the multiplicity of ideologies within the [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=740.6800000000001s)]
*  PLO and within the Palestinian National Liberation Movement. It all gave us lots of those sort [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=746.08s)]
*  of ingredients for a typical liberal democracy if we had a typical nation state. But needs [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=750.9200000000001s)]
*  to be a country that neither exists, neither the sovereignty nor the conditions to move [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=761.6800000000001s)]
*  further. And today, I think that the perspectives are much more, they're much worse than 20 [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=770.16s)]
*  years ago, for example, or 30 years ago, much worse. Not only because the conditions are [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=781.4s)]
*  worse, but because the potential is not there anymore, in part because it was de-developed, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=787.56s)]
*  because it was destructed over years, but also in part because the modes of operation [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=794.84s)]
*  are completely different nowadays, and a place like Palestine doesn't really have much of [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=802.4399999999999s)]
*  a say on itself on how to work. So if we look at the figures, they are frightening. The [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=810.44s)]
*  likelihood of getting a job if you get a university education is less than if you don't. In both [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=818.72s)]
*  cases, you won't get a job with an unemployment rate of about 40 percent. I mean, of course, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=824.08s)]
*  the Central Bureau of Statistics figures are significantly different than this one. But [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=831.48s)]
*  you all know the question of how to count and who to count and what to count, et cetera. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=839.44s)]
*  But people are much more frustrated. People are much more in debt. People have less and [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=846.84s)]
*  less reserves to talk about. I mean, the number of students who drop out for a semester at [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=854.5600000000001s)]
*  my university because of financial reasons is growing. This wasn't the case many years [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=862.56s)]
*  ago. I mean, we had dropouts, for example, when the Israeli labor market was open because [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=870.3199999999999s)]
*  it was extremely feasible to work for like four months and get your money for the next [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=874.76s)]
*  two years or something like that. Now this doesn't exist, but then neither do any other [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=879.5999999999999s)]
*  things. It exists and so on and so forth. With the current sort of what I call the swallowing [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=886.6s)]
*  the World Bank catalog by the Palestinian prime ministers, one after the other actually, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=894.6s)]
*  I mean, there's not much difference between the current prime minister and Salam Fayyad [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=902.6s)]
*  in this particular sense, creates a situation where you are using rules that are not designated [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=909.6s)]
*  for the place. It simply doesn't work and I think it will not work unless we can find [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=915.6s)]
*  a way to adjust. In Palestine there is no adjustment without external interference. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=923.6s)]
*  Of course, this interference can be of importance. But on our own we don't have the resources [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=928.6s)]
*  to feed ourselves and that would be the bottom line of the story. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=935.6s)]
*  Jamal Khashoggi from the Saudi columnist and journalist. Do you want to comment on the [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=940.6s)]
*  status of the Saudi economy since 2011 and what implications it might have for governance [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=947.6s)]
*  and political stability? The Saudi economy is one of the largest economies [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=954.6s)]
*  in the world, which make a difference from any other economy in the world. Oil revenue, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=959.6s)]
*  cheap foreign labor and government handout. We should not compare cheap foreign labor [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=967.6s)]
*  to what you have here in America. It's a huge debate. Here in America you are worried or [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=975.76s)]
*  debating the presence of about 12 percent of the labor force who are non-Americans. While [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=982.44s)]
*  in Saudi Arabia we have a problem of 80 percent who control the labor market who are non-Saudis. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=989.8800000000001s)]
*  That makes it a very unorthodox economy. But foreign labor are very essential for the Saudi [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=997.6400000000001s)]
*  private sector, for the Saudi plans for diversification. But at the same time they are a huge liability, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1006.5600000000001s)]
*  a critical liability that could eventually lead to unrest because they derive the Saudis [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1014.56s)]
*  from their jobs. And not only the jobs, they derive the Saudis from the skills and the [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1023.76s)]
*  knowledge to learn. And that will be a problem. I think this is the most important, the most [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1029.96s)]
*  important problem that's going to face the government. It is the unemployment issue. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1033.8799999999999s)]
*  The government handout, I sum up in handout everything that the government do for us, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1039.76s)]
*  the Saudis, from the literal handout in the form of a royal stevedent or a stevedent [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1045.16s)]
*  to a tribal sheikh. And they do make a trickle-down economy because those sheikhs and those royals [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1054.12s)]
*  when they get money from the government, they pass it to the people. Of course they will [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1060.04s)]
*  enjoy it, but they will also pass it to the people. And MBS even defended those stevedents [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1065.36s)]
*  in a private gathering. From that perspective, he used the trickle-down economy theory. And [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1071.68s)]
*  honestly it does work. I mean there are many Saudis who go to royals and receive help from [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1078.96s)]
*  them. Of course that is not proper economy, but it is making people happy, or some people [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1086.1599999999999s)]
*  happy. Also a government handout in the form of subsidies, government handout in the form [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1092.64s)]
*  of huge government contracts and huge mega jobs, mega projects. And that makes the Saudi [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1099.0s)]
*  private sector revolve and work. But if the government handout is stopped, and that is [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1112.2800000000002s)]
*  what is happening right now, MBS is doing very good in stopping waste in this handout [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1119.28s)]
*  formula. He's cutting on subsidies. He's cutting on unneeded government contracts and unneeded [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1129.28s)]
*  huge projects. But that had a negative effect on the economy. Now we have a recession of [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1138.8799999999999s)]
*  our own. Even though many Saudis are unhappy with it, I think it is healthy, because it [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1146.88s)]
*  will force us to go into real economy and away from this artificial economy that we [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1155.5200000000002s)]
*  the Saudis should not have. Saudi Arabia is not a small Gulf state. It is a real country [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1165.44s)]
*  with a population of 20 million people. Seventy percent of them are young and they want jobs. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1171.8400000000001s)]
*  And they will never have jobs with the presence of 30 percent of the population as foreign [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1179.28s)]
*  who control 80 percent of the jobs. So it is oil, handout, and the cheap labor. MBS, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1185.0s)]
*  I think he came at the right time. He put out a plan, 2030, to diversify the Saudi [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1192.0s)]
*  economy, free Saudi Arabia from oil. The good thing about his plan, it brought all of the [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1208.36s)]
*  ills of the Saudi economy above the table. The formula that worked in Saudi Arabia for [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1215.36s)]
*  decades and kept it free from the effect of the Arab Spring, I don't think it was sustainable. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1226.7199999999998s)]
*  And I think he, the young crown prince, doesn't think it's sustainable. Saudi Arabia could [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1237.0s)]
*  have continued on that wasteful expenditure of revenue, but it will eventually come to [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1243.44s)]
*  an end. It is just like a wealthy man who is going on a trip and just spending money [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1252.8000000000002s)]
*  and not checking his balance. So we were doing that. We were building projects that were [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1258.8400000000001s)]
*  totally unneeded. And something very interesting to read, it is the Bloomberg interview with [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1263.8400000000001s)]
*  Mohammed bin Salman last year where he admitted that there were billions of dollars being [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1271.24s)]
*  wasted away in the past. So despite whether his plan is going to work or not, it is our [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1278.24s)]
*  last chance. It has to work. We the Saudis have to support it. But the downside of the [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1285.52s)]
*  plan, it doesn't have a check and balance mechanism by the people. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1293.76s)]
*  It has its own mechanism of check and balance. He, the crown prince, from his position as [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1301.84s)]
*  the head of the economic affairs council, he is the one who is going to monitor the [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1313.48s)]
*  plan, hold his ministers accountable by using KPI. They imported this measure of key promoter [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1320.72s)]
*  indicators from the private sector and injected into the government, which it could work. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1327.72s)]
*  There are ones who argue that there are countries who developed, who make a huge economic transformation [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1338.8s)]
*  without democracy. Actually, I wrote that last year. And I quoted a professor who claimed [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1346.76s)]
*  that China and Vietnam and Brondi made it without democracy. I said, maybe we the Saudis [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1354.56s)]
*  can do the same thing. Honestly, I would rather to have democracy or to add muscle to the [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1368.4s)]
*  Shura Council. But the people in Saudi Arabia are not interested in that. If I call for [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1375.4s)]
*  this, no one is going to rally behind me. So we just have no choice but to put our trust [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1383.52s)]
*  in the young leadership and pray they will do it right. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1391.92s)]
*  It sounds as though there's a consensus that the conditions associated with blocked economic [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1398.8000000000002s)]
*  opportunities or blocked ambition on the part of young Arabs across the MENA region [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1403.12s)]
*  remains a salient concern and one that it does not seem to, there doesn't seem to be [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1408.1999999999998s)]
*  the political will to really engage in the forms of structural adjustment that would [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1413.9599999999998s)]
*  be required to solve some of those foundational problems. Now, the basic formula for the IFI [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1418.32s)]
*  formula for how to engage in those structural reforms, the expertise for how to implement [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1426.8s)]
*  that has existed for many years. To what extent do you think that these structural reform [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1431.0s)]
*  programs can be successfully implemented in your country cases? Maybe we'll start with [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1436.6000000000001s)]
*  OFA. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1444.6000000000001s)]
*  In Tunisia, structural reforms, sorry, I really mean essentially after evolution when we never [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1445.6000000000001s)]
*  registered low wage growth around one and now we are going for three. So to implement [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1452.6s)]
*  because the wage, the rate wage in the public finance is one of the highest in the world, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1464.36s)]
*  so we have to do it for the pension, for the public labour and to boost for the private [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1473.12s)]
*  sector. To give more assets and fiscal assets and fiscal equity, so reforms on fiscal, reforms [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1480.8s)]
*  on tax consumption to be sure for the informal sector and for the tax customs, the people [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1492.8s)]
*  that are not going to buy from the informal sector, the parallel economy and subsidies [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1502.0s)]
*  are one of the problems that we have to put it on. It's the meaning time because the price [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1510.32s)]
*  of the oil has gone down and we are readjusting the prices to be sure, to be more efficient, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1517.32s)]
*  to target on people who really need the subsidies, so to be more efficient and less cost for [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1524.52s)]
*  the government, for the finance public. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1533.1999999999998s)]
*  And to what extent do you think the political will exist to make these changes? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1538.24s)]
*  We have to make a consensus and it's social dialogue to be sure to share the risk and [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1544.2s)]
*  to share the principles and objectives to be sure that we can reach the flexibility [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1551.2s)]
*  of labour market and the social dialogue with labour unions so that they will adopt those [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1558.68s)]
*  reforms and with the support of all the coalition political parties in the parliament it will [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1566.24s)]
*  pass and the law will pass anonymously. It's a social dialogue that is starting, discussing [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1573.24s)]
*  essentially how to cut the public wage, how to boost for the private sector, how to switch [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1583.2s)]
*  for the private sector. We are implementing a new line for more transparency and accountability [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1591.2s)]
*  to know how the impact of private sector and the private partnership, public-private partnership [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1598.92s)]
*  in the budgetary law, so it could help even citizens to be more aware and conscious about [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1606.16s)]
*  the accountability and for the government, for the public finance to know what really [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1613.88s)]
*  are the impacts on GDP and what will bring the growth in the future. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1623.48s)]
*  Let me start with your political will and again what is political when we talk about [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1630.48s)]
*  the political will, whose political will are we talking about? In the structural adjustment [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1648.72s)]
*  programmes, I mean there's nothing, we're talking about the political will probably [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1654.32s)]
*  of corporations, of something international, of something in the case of Palestine more [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1659.32s)]
*  Israeli than Palestinian and in the case of the Arab world more American and European [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1665.04s)]
*  than Arab. It's very external. Now I mean if I understand correctly that we are in the [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1670.04s)]
*  framework of discussing these economic issues with an eye on democratization, with an eye [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1677.24s)]
*  on government, etc., I think it's futile. I mean it's just redundant to look at the [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1685.6s)]
*  current way of implementing structural adjustments if these adjustments actually remove any remote [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1691.2s)]
*  even possibility of having a public or national will. I mean look at Palestine, again with [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1699.2s)]
*  this notion of Singapore, you said it was, foreign direct investment simply cannot exist [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1709.32s)]
*  with Israeli regulation. So you can adjust as much as you want. We've got more laws [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1719.3600000000001s)]
*  than any other country in the south probably and now we have since the division in Palestine, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1725.8s)]
*  since 2007 with the parliament being absolutely inactive, we have a president who listens [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1733.8s)]
*  very well to the IMF and implements whatever Salam Fayyad used to tell him in Nawram Al [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1740.84s)]
*  Hamdallah who listened to the IMF and we have, you know he has a free hand with legislation [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1745.84s)]
*  and he's been doing it. In the past nine years Abu Mazen has issued more laws than the Palestinian [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1753.6s)]
*  Legislative Council has issued in their ten years of existence, free handed basically, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1760.6s)]
*  and nonetheless nothing improved and not only did not improve, it actually went back in [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1767.6799999999998s)]
*  major steps. So it's not about structural adjustment, it's not about legislation. I [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1775.3999999999999s)]
*  work on something called the Arab Democracy Index, I'm not sure if you're familiar with [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1781.32s)]
*  it. In the Arab Democracy Index comparing ten different Arab countries we found out [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1786.32s)]
*  that the more there is legal reform including economic legislation, the more there is legal [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1792.28s)]
*  reform the further is the sort of theory from practice in the sense of democracy. So a [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1800.72s)]
*  place like Palestine where we had an absolute free hand, you know starting from scratch [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1808.72s)]
*  we could legislate whatever we want, we had a very interesting kind of combination in [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1815.92s)]
*  the first Palestinian PLC of 1996, intellectual, civil society, organization, actors and what [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1820.84s)]
*  have you. They wrote very interesting legislations with lots of experts from the US, Europe and [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1828.4s)]
*  Europe, lots of foreign and Arab advice and we've created a very interesting bundle of [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1835.96s)]
*  legislations. As a matter of fact we stand only about point sort of ten percent beyond [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1843.0s)]
*  the Saudi Arabian situation in democratic practices while we stand eighty percent beyond [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1852.0800000000002s)]
*  them in legislation. So what's the point of legislating? The same happened actually in [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1860.04s)]
*  Egypt during the era when there was a great push for legislative reforms, several stations. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1866.08s)]
*  I mean even during the first attempt to reform in the late 70s, then two phases during the [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1873.6399999999999s)]
*  Mubarak era of legislative reforms. They produced nothing in terms of localizing or [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1880.64s)]
*  creating the atmosphere for people to create politics. So if we're talking about external [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1894.4s)]
*  politics then we probably would be, if I'm allowed to use a Foucauldian term, we're probably [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1899.0400000000002s)]
*  discussing governmentality and not governance which will not lead to any democratic change [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1905.0s)]
*  obviously. If we want to discuss governance in the sense of the existence of some participation [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1912.36s)]
*  etc. I think structural adjustments in the framework, I mean in the general sense that [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1919.36s)]
*  they do exist in the world are not only useless, they are actually, they do have negative impacts [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1926.44s)]
*  on such places as Palestine because again foreign direct investment in Palestine meant [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1933.44s)]
*  immigration of capital and immigration of actually vital resources from the financiers [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1941.28s)]
*  who suck the money in the country and put it back. Something that Egypt suffered from [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1947.24s)]
*  a lot evidently in the past but there was, in that condition there was something probably [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1953.68s)]
*  to balance it in a sense. In Palestine there is nothing. The other thing for example, it's [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1961.44s)]
*  fascinating, talk about privatization. There's no public, there is no public investment in [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1966.44s)]
*  Palestine to start with. I mean things, real estate, land, state land, state owned property [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1976.28s)]
*  is basically land. It belonged to the Ottoman Emir or to the Ottoman Sultanate. So it's [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1983.04s)]
*  a government, then to the British, then to the Jordanian, now to the Palestinian Authority. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1990.68s)]
*  It's meaningless. It is now put, I mean all of it is now put in a fund to camouflage the [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=1999.3200000000002s)]
*  economic failures. So what we do is basically when we look at the major investment arm of [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2005.1200000000001s)]
*  the Palestinian Authority, I forgot what it's called, the main fund for the Palestinian [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2013.44s)]
*  Authority created, what they do is they spend money as they wish and then they re-evaluate [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2020.68s)]
*  real estate which keeps growing high and they report income. And that's what it's done. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2025.0s)]
*  Nothing else. There's nothing to privatize to start with. And it is not clear to me, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2033.0s)]
*  I mean what is it that we're talking about when we talk about structural adjustment when [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2038.3600000000001s)]
*  there is no structure of the economy to really start with. So maybe we should start with [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2042.0800000000002s)]
*  we should put the thing, flip it the way around. Let us ask ourselves what kind of economic [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2050.68s)]
*  changes do we need in order to create democracy or to enhance, to create some sort of governance, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2060.2799999999997s)]
*  to get people involved and engaged, to get some political participation. We probably [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2068.48s)]
*  need to create jobs. It's not about who is the investor. It's not about even if it will [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2073.2s)]
*  be, in my sense, I mean one of the things I would usually ask in a relatively rhetoric [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2079.7599999999998s)]
*  question but I still think it's valid. We, like Jordan and many other countries, Egypt [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2089.3599999999997s)]
*  included, we have a bloated public sector. Now it's bloated with what? It's bloated with [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2098.8399999999997s)]
*  mostly nowadays with security personnel who constitute probably, I don't know, maybe some [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2106.8s)]
*  40% of the public sector and it is bloated. And I asked myself, so why don't we send them [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2111.92s)]
*  to do agriculture? I mean they're getting their salaries. Let's not empower them completely. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2116.92s)]
*  We cannot just sack them because they will turn into monsters on the streets probably. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2129.88s)]
*  It's not good for the, neither for the economy nor socially, nor for the justice sector or [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2135.48s)]
*  for what have you to get more unemployed people. But maybe we can engage in a public sector [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2147.88s)]
*  developed agricultural endeavor. No matter how this sounds strange but let them do something [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2155.16s)]
*  instead of just sitting there claiming to be policemen or what have you. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2161.44s)]
*  So you've pointed to two fundamental characteristics of most Arab states from a historical perspective [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2166.44s)]
*  which would be state control of agricultural land which is a long standing sort of pattern. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2173.76s)]
*  No, no, no. The state land is very un-agricultural. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2178.76s)]
*  But centralization of state control of land, at least in many cases, is a common characteristic [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2183.76s)]
*  and the centralization of political power and the relative lack of constraints on executives [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2191.7200000000003s)]
*  in the sense that the populations don't have the mechanisms to necessarily constrain centralized [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2196.92s)]
*  forms of political control. If we think about these constraints as being quite historic [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2203.12s)]
*  and quite structural, what are the opportunities to really overcome that? You mentioned the [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2208.5s)]
*  structural adjustment programs which are intended to improve the economic conditions. If that [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2212.86s)]
*  is not one way forward, what would be the way to overcome these structural constraints? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2218.56s)]
*  I mean, look, after we've seen the indicators of very successful structural adjustments in [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2223.56s)]
*  Tunisia and Egypt, right in the 2010 reports actually, and what they led to, we probably [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2231.56s)]
*  should revisit the whole notion of what kind of structural adjustment we want. We know [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2240.12s)]
*  the story. This paradigm failed no matter how it sounds interesting and nice. It just [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2245.28s)]
*  didn't work. It led to the conditions that we're discussing today and we probably should [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2252.48s)]
*  consider other alternatives. Now, it is so evident that we cannot do politics without [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2259.0400000000004s)]
*  economy. It is so evident that we cannot get people enthusiastic about the economy and [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2265.0s)]
*  not looking for immigration if there is no political environment. The question of the [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2272.0s)]
*  middle ground between these two is a question of making sure simply that people, once they [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2277.68s)]
*  endeavor into something, once they become entrepreneurial, they should be able to be [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2286.76s)]
*  entrepreneurial on both fronts at the same time, both in politics and in economy. Whether [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2291.64s)]
*  this takes place in... One of the things about structural adjustment is that in Palestine, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2297.68s)]
*  for example, do I have some time to tell you a small story? Okay. One time I go to the [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2308.52s)]
*  barber and I found out that his son is coming to ask for pocket money and his son was my [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2314.3599999999997s)]
*  student. So I look in the mirror and I say, hey, that's you. So where are you? He said [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2322.36s)]
*  I'm graduated. I said, so how come you're asking for pocket money if you're graduated? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2330.92s)]
*  He said, I'm still looking for a job. So what are your plans? He says, look, me and three [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2335.92s)]
*  of my friends, our parents gave us $3,000 each. So we have a total of $12,000. We went to [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2341.1200000000003s)]
*  open a small business. I said, what business? He says, it's a company that is happy to [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2348.12s)]
*  deliver any service you want. I mean, we don't really know what we want to do, but we're [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2355.12s)]
*  going to get an office, a phone number, and we're going to do whatever people ask us to [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2360.6s)]
*  do, arrange a party, wash the car, create a conference, whatever. And they have, it's [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2366.6s)]
*  for youth who have $12,000, which is good in the scale of our economy. So a few months [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2374.08s)]
*  passed by and I'm cutting my hair again and the guy comes in and asks for pocket money. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2380.48s)]
*  I said, so what happened to your business? He said, look, I went, we went to register [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2385.48s)]
*  the company and we had to pay about $1,500, a little more than $1,500 for the fees that [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2392.16s)]
*  are obligatory to hire a lawyer to register the company. And then we had to open files [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2400.16s)]
*  in the tax authority, that authority, the other authority, whatever, get license from [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2409.56s)]
*  the municipality, this, that, and the other, all with fees. And then we went to hire space. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2413.64s)]
*  We were looking for 50 square meters, which is what? I don't know. But probably as big [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2419.08s)]
*  as, smaller than this one, smaller than this one. So we can operate. We, we, we subscribed [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2427.08s)]
*  for a phone number and by the time we were, we were opening the place, we had zero money [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2436.72s)]
*  to operate. They spent the, the sort of the capital that they had basically on running [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2444.7599999999998s)]
*  through the, but not the bureaucracy this time around. It's the corporatized system [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2450.92s)]
*  of bureaucratization of the, of, of, because who needs all these regulations in terms of [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2457.92s)]
*  for, for, for young people? On the contrary, for example, if you look at a country that [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2463.92s)]
*  still has some very funny type of, of socialist components in their economy, in Algeria, for [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2469.7200000000003s)]
*  example, a, a university graduate who is, who opens even a kiosk to sell cigarettes [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2477.72s)]
*  will get a, a tax waiver for five years from all taxes. I mean, that's one way to look [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2486.04s)]
*  at it and the, and the other way to look at it is, is how the Palestinian system works. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2494.7999999999997s)]
*  So a couple or three years ago we had one more tax reform and so the highest bracket [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2500.68s)]
*  was I think 30% and then the ex-communists and the PFLP, the ultra left if you will, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2508.48s)]
*  went on to demonstrations and these demonstrations got to be successful in two places, in Hamburg [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2516.4s)]
*  and in Nablus. I don't know why. Maybe because they're more populated areas and they've succeeded [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2520.92s)]
*  in going down to the street against the new tax law and what they managed to do is to [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2526.2s)]
*  remove the higher brackets from 30% down to 25% but, but nothing that had to do with the [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2531.64s)]
*  poorer people and, and, and only three days ago I hear our minister of finance declaring [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2536.96s)]
*  that they are thinking of getting the tax bracket now from 15% to 10% the highest. So [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2544.92s)]
*  they, what, what they are do is they, you know, everybody has to pay taxes and the income [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2552.92s)]
*  is so low anyway and people are really frustrated with these, with these taxes while businesses [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2558.6s)]
*  like the telecom in Palestine keep getting these waivers from taxes under the investment [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2565.76s)]
*  promotion, investment promotion law. They even had a case in court against them because [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2573.76s)]
*  they have declared introducing fiber optics, for example our telecom company, they've introduced [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2584.6000000000004s)]
*  fiber optics for the 15th year in row as an innovation and it's a reason to get the, you [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2591.2000000000003s)]
*  know, to get the money, get paid from a good amount of taxes and when they left the court [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2603.0600000000004s)]
*  case they went to the president and they still got it, they still got the tax thing. So maybe [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2607.0200000000004s)]
*  we should look into more communal modalities. More of get a job, don't pay taxes for a few [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2614.32s)]
*  years, find a way to do a job, get involved not only because we need to find room for [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2622.2000000000003s)]
*  and room for people not to starve, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2629.2s)]
*  but also because we need to find a way [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2632.08s)]
*  to tell people that you do have, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2635.6s)]
*  without reaching a major threshold, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2638.52s)]
*  you do have a way to get into the shaping [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2640.8399999999997s)]
*  of your own country. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2643.6s)]
*  It's very important to deliver this message. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2645.7999999999997s)]
*  And I think with all the existing structural [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2648.2s)]
*  adjustment modalities and whatever goes together with them, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2653.24s)]
*  the whole package, we are exactly doing the opposite. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2656.56s)]
*  Jamal, the challenges facing the Saudi economy [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2661.16s)]
*  are quite different, and the proposal, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2663.68s)]
*  the 2030 Saudi vision proposal lays out a roadmap [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2666.64s)]
*  for what some of those changes might look like. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2670.88s)]
*  To what extent do you think that this proposal [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2673.2799999999997s)]
*  will be realized in the timeframe [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2675.44s)]
*  that it's been suggested? [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2677.6s)]
*  The proposal, in essence, is great. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2680.08s)]
*  It's just a very good election of promises [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2682.88s)]
*  that we, as a Saudi Arabian, I want them to be visualized [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2689.1600000000003s)]
*  and to succeed. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2693.8s)]
*  But I see two problems in it. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2699.2400000000002s)]
*  Without freeing the Saudi economy from dependency [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2703.96s)]
*  on the foreign labor, the extensive use of foreign labor, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2707.36s)]
*  I don't think the project can succeed. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2711.68s)]
*  They have to address this issue first, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2715.16s)]
*  because that will transform the Saudi into a real economy, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2720.48s)]
*  not a virtual economy, economy based on the people [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2724.56s)]
*  on production, not the elite production. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2728.04s)]
*  Who benefits from cheap foreign labor? [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2731.8399999999997s)]
*  It is a Saudi private sector who are rich, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2735.96s)]
*  or business people who hire cheap laborer, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2741.7200000000003s)]
*  while the majority of the Saudi people [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2747.8s)]
*  do not benefit from those transformations. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2750.12s)]
*  They will just wait for government handout, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2752.7200000000003s)]
*  some form of a government handout, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2754.92s)]
*  and the government cannot continue in doing handout. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2756.96s)]
*  So we need to transform our economy into a classic economy [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2759.6s)]
*  where people work, increase production, pay taxes, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2765.48s)]
*  or not necessarily pay taxes, [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2771.48s)]
*  but I will be stoned in Saudi Arabia to say that, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2774.92s)]
*  because the people, the Saudi don't pay taxes. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2779.64s)]
*  But we need some form of a real economy, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2784.04s)]
*  not an economy that is artificial like the Gulf States. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2788.56s)]
*  That is the most important challenge facing the plan. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2793.16s)]
*  The other challenge, the plan, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2797.68s)]
*  or the implementators of the plan, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2801.2s)]
*  they need to be more tolerant to criticism. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2804.8399999999997s)]
*  They are addressing huge decision to be made, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2808.16s)]
*  like sealing Aramco or part of Aramco. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2812.3999999999996s)]
*  And this issue, it is not being debatable in Saudi Arabia. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2815.2799999999997s)]
*  This is a livelihood of every single Saudi, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2817.96s)]
*  and the Crown Prince, the government, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2822.16s)]
*  they need to listen from experienced Saudis [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2826.44s)]
*  who maybe have a better ideas than to seal Aramco, for example. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2831.6s)]
*  They need to review their plans, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2838.48s)]
*  but the government, it is in a very strong position. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2842.64s)]
*  I will go back to your earlier question [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2845.6s)]
*  about the political will. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2847.76s)]
*  The Saudi government has all the political will [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2851.68s)]
*  it could ask for right now. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2854.4s)]
*  They enjoy the support of the people, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2859.1600000000003s)]
*  the trust of the people. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2861.1600000000003s)]
*  They are free from any foreign pressure. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2864.6400000000003s)]
*  The government is not indebted to any government in the world. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2868.52s)]
*  It is not receiving aid or subsidies. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2872.36s)]
*  So literally, they can do anything they want. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2877.08s)]
*  And they are doing that right now. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2879.44s)]
*  I began to see things which [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2881.32s)]
*  previous governments of Saudi Arabia were reluctant to do, [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2884.6400000000003s)]
*  like opening up Saudi Arabia for entertainment. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2889.2000000000003s)]
*  The silly issue of women driving, for example, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2893.0800000000004s)]
*  there's never been a better time to remove it [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2896.1200000000003s)]
*  from our way as of today. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2900.84s)]
*  And I'm sure if Mohammed Bin Salman come out tonight [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2903.96s)]
*  or tomorrow announcing that women will be allowed to drive, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2909.52s)]
*  he would receive huge applause from the Saudis. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2914.8s)]
*  There would be few Saudis who would object, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2918.12s)]
*  but I'm sure the majority of the Saudi will support that. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2921.28s)]
*  So they have the benefit of the political will, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2926.0s)]
*  but as a Saudi Arabian, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2930.44s)]
*  I would like the government to be more tolerant, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2933.08s)]
*  to listen to counter opinions, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2937.4s)]
*  and to engage the Saudi Shura Council [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2941.48s)]
*  or some form of power sharing. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2948.1600000000003s)]
*  So we will share together this important transformation, [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2951.0s)]
*  because again, it is our last chance. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2956.84s)]
*  If it goes wrong, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2959.48s)]
*  there are millions of unemployed Saudis who need jobs. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2961.8s)]
*  And then we will have a situation, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2966.72s)]
*  Tunisia 2011 or Egypt, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2969.96s)]
*  people get angry when they don't have jobs. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2973.24s)]
*  And that's eventually gonna happen in Saudi Arabia. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2977.3599999999997s)]
*  There is a drive for Saudization, but it is not working. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2981.16s)]
*  There is a huge dispute about the number of unemployment. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2985.2799999999997s)]
*  You could write an extensive article about [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2988.64s)]
*  what is the true unemployment figure in Saudi? [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2991.24s)]
*  Is it 12%, as the government says, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2994.52s)]
*  or 20%, as many other researchers argue. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=2997.28s)]
*  I think it is more than 12%. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3001.44s)]
*  We have also, the numbers, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3003.52s)]
*  some of the false elements of those numbers, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3006.56s)]
*  there are false Saudi Saudization. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3012.0s)]
*  There are Saudis who are being hired in jobs, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3014.2400000000002s)]
*  so the businessman can get, by hiring one Saudi, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3018.0s)]
*  five visas or something like that, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3022.32s)]
*  to bring in foreign laborers. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3025.32s)]
*  So the Saudi will have a job, but actually he's not working. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3028.12s)]
*  Maybe he's also being asked to stay at his home. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3032.2400000000002s)]
*  What matters to me as a businessman, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3035.92s)]
*  it is just to respect the government criteria [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3038.08s)]
*  and the government conditions, [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3042.64s)]
*  so I will have [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3044.16s)]
*  the chance to import foreign laborers, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3048.6s)]
*  because I am used to foreign laborers. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3051.48s)]
*  So those are the two challenges, foreign laborers, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3055.28s)]
*  and we need to share [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3059.52s)]
*  into the decision making of Vision 2030. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3065.44s)]
*  Thank you guys. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3070.68s)]
*  I wanted to also answer. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3071.52s)]
*  You wanted just to react on the adjustment program. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3073.32s)]
*  Tunisia is a successful case on the adjustment program, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3078.44s)]
*  but the adjustment program on 90s is starting, [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3080.88s)]
*  and now we have to move to a new framework. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3083.56s)]
*  There is a political will, [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3087.36s)]
*  and there is a new framework on investment, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3089.0s)]
*  how to boost investment, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3092.68s)]
*  essentially how to reduce the delay, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3094.08s)]
*  to build a trust to reduce [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3096.44s)]
*  between the rules and the practices. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3100.12s)]
*  It's a unique desk where entrepreneurs can go [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3102.36s)]
*  and can open their own entrepreneurship, [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3107.04s)]
*  entrepreneur, enterprise, [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3110.72s)]
*  and they have five years to not pay the waiver's tax. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3113.64s)]
*  This is one of the measures [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3119.16s)]
*  to boost investment essentially for youth. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3121.56s)]
*  The second thing is for women. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3124.92s)]
*  There is a special line credit dedicated for women [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3127.0s)]
*  to reduce the risk when they are married, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3130.68s)]
*  and they cannot get the credit because the man [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3135.0s)]
*  has the credit and had opened his own project. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3138.44s)]
*  So those kind of practices, [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3141.04s)]
*  boost private investment, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3143.4s)]
*  but essentially how to create job for youth, [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3146.0s)]
*  but by youth. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3150.04s)]
*  Probably we need to think about adjusting [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3152.88s)]
*  the notion of structural adjustment, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3155.28s)]
*  because the way it works [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3156.84s)]
*  is that it is not feasible for small businesses. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3158.8s)]
*  It is designed to create foreign investment, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3161.56s)]
*  which is usually big and huge, [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3164.96s)]
*  and hence you get stuck with your youth. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3166.7599999999998s)]
*  So the whole notion of structural adjustment [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3170.6s)]
*  needs restructuring. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3173.0s)]
*  So I want to open up the floor to our audience. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3174.8799999999997s)]
*  Larry, I know you're anxious to ask a question. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3176.9599999999996s)]
*  Excellent Carnegie report. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3184.9599999999996s)]
*  Recent of the two, I guess late last year, [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3188.4399999999996s)]
*  identified some priorities for reform. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3192.64s)]
*  One on the corruption front, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3197.2799999999997s)]
*  which many people are talking about, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3199.3599999999997s)]
*  that there really needs to be more concerted action, [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3201.2799999999997s)]
*  was very specifically that the declarations of assets [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3204.12s)]
*  for public officials be made public. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3208.92s)]
*  And as someone who's thought about this problem, [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3211.56s)]
*  I don't think you really get traction on endemic corruption [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3214.44s)]
*  unless these assets declarations are made public. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3217.6s)]
*  I also think you need a really independent [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3221.36s)]
*  counter corruption commission, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3223.6800000000003s)]
*  and I'd be interested in your views on that. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3225.04s)]
*  And the second was that Tunisia gets serious [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3227.6800000000003s)]
*  about collecting taxes and being more assertive [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3230.6800000000003s)]
*  about the capital outflows [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3235.88s)]
*  that are going out in illicit ways. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3237.44s)]
*  So I was just wondering if you could speak more specifically [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3239.1600000000003s)]
*  to those two issues, and to Jamal, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3243.28s)]
*  you dismissed the idea that Saudi Arabia [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3246.36s)]
*  could or should collect taxes. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3251.48s)]
*  And I wonder if that should be dismissed. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3254.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, the core problem of a rentier economy, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3256.48s)]
*  and many people think a core obstacle to democracy [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3260.1200000000003s)]
*  or better governance in a rentier economy [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3266.0s)]
*  is precisely that people don't pay taxes [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3268.56s)]
*  and therefore they have no stake in things. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3272.2000000000003s)]
*  So maybe if you could move, [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3274.8s)]
*  even with all of Saudi Arabia's wealth, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3276.88s)]
*  which is increasingly stressed [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3279.1200000000003s)]
*  as the population gets larger, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3282.52s)]
*  if you could move even to modest and symbolic taxation, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3285.0800000000004s)]
*  maybe it would be a healthy thing for politics. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3288.7200000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3295.52s)]
*  So for declaration of public estate, [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3297.44s)]
*  how to make it public? [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3301.04s)]
*  For politicians, it's obliged to do it, [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3303.36s)]
*  but it's not public. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3307.32s)]
*  It's an account call. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3308.6s)]
*  But we are obliged by law to do it. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3313.44s)]
*  All politicians, ministers. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3315.6s)]
*  So there is transparency, they are not getting wealthier [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3319.32s)]
*  when they are in position or abuse of power. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3323.88s)]
*  This won't think on transparency, let's say. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3328.4s)]
*  And reforms on corruption, [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3333.48s)]
*  there's a big, let's say, war of anti-corruption [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3336.2s)]
*  started those last months. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3341.2400000000002s)]
*  It's a national strategy on fighting corruption. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3344.52s)]
*  It starts by putting a fixed and strong pillar [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3349.12s)]
*  in institutional and by law. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3353.84s)]
*  So there is a lot of access to information [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3357.44s)]
*  of course, but a law of reporting corruption, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3362.48s)]
*  cases and protecting the whistleblowers [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3368.12s)]
*  and this law passed anonymously in the parliament. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3371.76s)]
*  There is an independent national institution [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3376.56s)]
*  of anti-corruption and there is an extent of the budget [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3379.2400000000002s)]
*  given by the Chief of Government last year. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3384.44s)]
*  And there is one of a mediano international media. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3387.2400000000002s)]
*  Reporting is the operation of clean hands [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3393.2400000000002s)]
*  which an extensive crackdown of the businessmen [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3396.0s)]
*  and figures on informal sectors. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3400.32s)]
*  Tackling corruption at different levels [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3403.32s)]
*  from, let's say, public institution to private to formal [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3408.2s)]
*  is really important to... [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3413.76s)]
*  I totally agree with you. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3416.24s)]
*  It will make the Saudi economy very healthy [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3425.96s)]
*  if even a minimal tax to be collected from the people. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3428.48s)]
*  It will make the government see us. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3432.64s)]
*  A couple of years ago there was a debate in Saudi Arabia [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3436.64s)]
*  on the diminishing middle class [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3439.7599999999998s)]
*  and there were people exchanging all kinds of numbers. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3441.68s)]
*  I wrote an article that said why we don't have a figure [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3445.24s)]
*  about the number of middle class [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3448.12s)]
*  and their diminishing number, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3450.72s)]
*  that because we do not count. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3453.3999999999996s)]
*  We are cost center to the government. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3457.04s)]
*  We are not generator of revenue. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3459.2799999999997s)]
*  So actually the government doesn't see the people [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3462.8399999999997s)]
*  whether their income increase or decrease. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3466.08s)]
*  So you are right, we need to introduce taxes. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3470.7200000000003s)]
*  But this is very risky. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3478.6000000000004s)]
*  There's a huge political implication to that. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3481.08s)]
*  Whether it's coming from a writer like me, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3484.6800000000003s)]
*  or if it comes from an official. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3488.56s)]
*  If MBS wants to lose the huge popularity he has today, [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3491.6000000000004s)]
*  today he should hint at collecting taxes. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3496.6s)]
*  But maybe he should leave it to his minister of planning, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3501.08s)]
*  Adil Fakih, because now in Saudi Arabia [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3504.68s)]
*  everything that the people don't like of Vision 2030, [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3508.48s)]
*  like the subsidies, the fees, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3513.04s)]
*  they blame it on the minister of planning. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3518.2799999999997s)]
*  So maybe Adil Fakih should come up with a statement [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3520.64s)]
*  about taxes and how useful taxes would be [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3527.7599999999998s)]
*  for the Saudi economy in the long term. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3530.6s)]
*  Michelle. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3534.72s)]
*  Thanks, Michelle Dunn from Carnegie Endowment. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3540.7599999999998s)]
*  Ulfa, you raised a very interesting point [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3543.92s)]
*  that I think really connects economic prosperity [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3547.24s)]
*  with governance, which is the point of access [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3550.8799999999997s)]
*  to information, the point of whether it's citizens, [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3554.2799999999997s)]
*  whether it's businesses, civil society organizations, [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3558.9199999999996s)]
*  parliamentarians such as yourself or whatever, [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3561.7599999999998s)]
*  having access to government information [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3564.8399999999997s)]
*  in order to make their plans one way or another, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3570.3599999999997s)]
*  economic plans, business plans, et cetera. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3574.2s)]
*  So I was wondering if each of the speakers [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3577.2799999999997s)]
*  could comment briefly on this issue [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3580.06s)]
*  of citizen access to government information [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3583.6s)]
*  and what you think about it, [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3588.48s)]
*  what role you think it plays or doesn't play [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3589.96s)]
*  in, for example, generating jobs [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3593.8799999999997s)]
*  and generating economic activity. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3600.48s)]
*  I think that Tunisia, from what I understand, [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3602.98s)]
*  Tunisian civil society groups placed a very high premium [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3607.54s)]
*  on gaining access to information, [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3613.98s)]
*  including information about the Tunisian parliament [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3617.5s)]
*  and about parliamentarians and how they were voting [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3619.82s)]
*  and a lot of things like that early in the game in Tunisia, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3622.7400000000002s)]
*  which is very different from what happened [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3626.22s)]
*  in a lot of the other countries that had uprisings. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3628.4s)]
*  Egypt, for example, this was not, [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3631.36s)]
*  not too many people paid attention to this. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3634.48s)]
*  Anyway, I'm curious what you all think about this issue. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3636.7200000000003s)]
*  Okay, thank you, Michelle. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3647.42s)]
*  I think it's one of the most important. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3649.96s)]
*  Sorry? [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3655.36s)]
*  I think it's one of the important. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3657.1200000000003s)]
*  One of the important role in voting in the parliament [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3661.6s)]
*  is given access to information, [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3665.6200000000003s)]
*  given access to data to every citizen. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3668.76s)]
*  Our information is politician, is economical, is social, [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3673.52s)]
*  and this access will shape policy based on evidence. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3678.44s)]
*  So policy will be more efficient [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3684.1400000000003s)]
*  and citizens will be more engaged to confess [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3686.7200000000003s)]
*  on what things are not. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3690.76s)]
*  Tunisia, for the work of the parliament, [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3697.84s)]
*  civil society in Tunisia, [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3701.94s)]
*  if I think I can put it, [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3707.36s)]
*  in Tunisia, civil society is very present, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3710.0s)]
*  essentially, on the work of committee in the parliament, [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3713.36s)]
*  given in full transparency, [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3718.36s)]
*  all the votes and all the decision and discussion [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3724.52s)]
*  and hearing session, and I think more over two or three [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3729.4s)]
*  are always present in our sessions in the parliament, [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3737.28s)]
*  trying to report to citizens on open data [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3741.92s)]
*  all the decision and the voters of every MP. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3746.68s)]
*  And I invite all parliaments in the Arab Spring [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3751.56s)]
*  to do the same. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3755.7599999999998s)]
*  Moudar, do you want to comment on the issue? [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3760.64s)]
*  Yes, I mean, the value of information and access to it [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3762.72s)]
*  and the relation between information and accountability [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3767.2s)]
*  is, I mean, you cannot underestimate it. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3770.08s)]
*  I mean, it's so important. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3774.12s)]
*  But you know what I'm thinking about is [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3775.72s)]
*  how do we go about it? [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3778.7599999999998s)]
*  So in a situation, for example, in Palestine, [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3780.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, what do you think will happen to Abu Mazen, [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3784.04s)]
*  our president, if he reveals all the information [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3787.2799999999997s)]
*  vis-a-vis his security cooperation with Israel? [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3790.4399999999996s)]
*  Or what will happen with the Muslim Brotherhood presidency [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3793.56s)]
*  in Egypt if they reveal the information of the relations [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3798.7999999999997s)]
*  with Qatar? [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3802.2s)]
*  Or what will happen if our government will tell us [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3803.48s)]
*  what kind of phone calls they get from the US embassy [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3808.2400000000002s)]
*  in Tel Aviv and how they act upon it? [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3811.04s)]
*  And beyond this, in this era of what I call [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3814.56s)]
*  extreme securitization, I mean, information is the privilege [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3818.32s)]
*  of security personnel, not the politicians, actually. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3823.2s)]
*  And nowadays, politicians are actually working for [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3826.96s)]
*  the security, not vice versa. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3829.96s)]
*  And things don't seem to be very different in the US, [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3832.16s)]
*  by the way. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3834.3999999999996s)]
*  I mean, with the, you know, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3835.24s)]
*  sort of with the needed [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3842.16s)]
*  differentiations. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3846.3599999999997s)]
*  So it is important, but then, you know, [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3848.24s)]
*  to get information as in information that is relevant [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3851.2s)]
*  to the action of the polity, [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3856.44s)]
*  we need to first maintain the polity. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3860.72s)]
*  So the answer is yes, but I mean, it is extremely important [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3865.52s)]
*  to have loads of access to information, [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3869.8399999999997s)]
*  but then we have to have also the system that allows [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3872.16s)]
*  for the flow of information without backfiring [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3876.04s)]
*  on the whole notion of stability of the political system, [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3879.8799999999997s)]
*  because it might in all the regimes I described [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3883.8799999999997s)]
*  as a matter of fact. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3887.6s)]
*  Look at the question of information [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3889.2s)]
*  with the Trump administration on his relation to Russia. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3890.68s)]
*  Look at the Palestinian-Israeli relations. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3894.64s)]
*  Look at the, you know, who are the real actors in Syria, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3897.36s)]
*  what really happened in Libya. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3901.96s)]
*  I mean, do you want all of this? [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3904.52s)]
*  I mean, it's important, but do you want to open [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3906.04s)]
*  the Pandora's box freely, I mean? [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3909.64s)]
*  Dama. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3912.8s)]
*  It is very essential, very important, [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3914.16s)]
*  but you need a full functioning democracy [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3917.08s)]
*  to achieve such a thing as a public information act. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3919.96s)]
*  In Saudi Arabia, there are attempt toward [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3925.6s)]
*  public information act or providing information. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3933.24s)]
*  Government announced or encouraged municipalities, [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3937.72s)]
*  for example, to list their contracts [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3942.0s)]
*  with their contracts on a website, [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3946.52s)]
*  but it's still being done on a voluntary basis [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3950.92s)]
*  and on a selective basis. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3953.36s)]
*  I don't think it would have been without [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3955.92s)]
*  a full functioning democracy with an empowered [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3959.04s)]
*  consultative council or a parliament in Saudi Arabia. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3963.1200000000003s)]
*  It would not have been. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3965.96s)]
*  The mindset, the prevailing mindset, [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3967.4s)]
*  we're a tribal society, a tribal leadership, [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3971.56s)]
*  that the sheikh knows better. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3974.48s)]
*  Whom are you to ask? [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3977.0s)]
*  And this require a huge transformation, [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3980.4s)]
*  but it is very essential. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3985.8s)]
*  I wrote about it a number of times in a book [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3987.68s)]
*  to be published, I called it A Citizen Vision 2030, [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3991.28s)]
*  where the government put its vision, [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3996.52s)]
*  and here is my vision as a citizen. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=3998.96s)]
*  I listed a number of demands I want from the government, [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4001.92s)]
*  and the last one of them was an information act, [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4005.84s)]
*  and I wasn't really keen about political issues, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4012.36s)]
*  like where Abu Mazen get his phone calls from, [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4014.92s)]
*  I was more keen about municipal issues, [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4021.2000000000003s)]
*  and I think they are more important. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4025.5600000000004s)]
*  I would be very much happy to start with that. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4027.0800000000004s)]
*  Why did such company get that contract, [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4030.2799999999997s)]
*  and for how much they got the contract. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4033.2799999999997s)]
*  That will have a major effect in stopping corruption [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4036.68s)]
*  and monitoring municipalities' affairs. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4042.16s)]
*  I've been a journalist all my life in Saudi Arabia. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4047.2s)]
*  It is one of the most difficult thing [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4050.08s)]
*  to call even the mayor of the city, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4053.8399999999997s)]
*  and ask him when, [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4056.76s)]
*  how much it is cost to fix the sidewalk on such a street. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4061.6800000000003s)]
*  He's not obliged to answer, [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4066.7200000000003s)]
*  so there has to be some kind of information act [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4069.5600000000004s)]
*  in Saudi Arabia, at least in the municipal level. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4074.6400000000003s)]
*  I would never ask the government [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4077.88s)]
*  how much they are spending on Egypt, for example, [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4080.6000000000004s)]
*  or their position about Sisi, or this or that. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4086.08s)]
*  I would be much happy just to ask about [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4089.3199999999997s)]
*  municipal issues. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4091.88s)]
*  Mike McFaul, you had a question. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4094.72s)]
*  And I don't want all the questions to be in the front, [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4101.2s)]
*  so I'll pass it back in the spirit of democracy. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4103.0s)]
*  Next time, okay, all right, Mike McFaul from Stanford. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4106.72s)]
*  So in the spring, MBS brought a giant delegation [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4110.64s)]
*  to the Silicon Valley, [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4113.04s)]
*  and we heard some of us that they're going to build [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4114.64s)]
*  in Saudi Arabia their own Silicon Valley. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4119.68s)]
*  Could you all comment on how crazy that is? [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4124.0s)]
*  Is it a complete pipe dream? [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4128.88s)]
*  Is it possible? [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4131.4800000000005s)]
*  What are the necessary conditions in all three [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4132.92s)]
*  of your countries for development of high tech? [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4135.160000000001s)]
*  Right next door to you is a country [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4138.160000000001s)]
*  that's figured out how to do it. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4141.0s)]
*  So what are the conditions that Israel has [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4142.68s)]
*  that are not present in Palestine or other places [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4146.280000000001s)]
*  that's prevented this? [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4149.96s)]
*  And push your answer out not just to two to five years, [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4151.08s)]
*  but 20 to 30 years. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4154.92s)]
*  Why couldn't this happen? [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4156.72s)]
*  Because after all, there are lots of people [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4158.56s)]
*  from your part of the world that work in my neighborhood [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4160.6s)]
*  who do really quite well. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4163.16s)]
*  So these cultural arguments seem to mean, [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4164.68s)]
*  it seems to suggest to me [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4168.320000000001s)]
*  that their actual institutional constraints [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4170.52s)]
*  or other factors, but tell us the state of the condition [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4173.64s)]
*  of kind of the information economy in your countries [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4176.4400000000005s)]
*  and does it have a future? [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4179.56s)]
*  Information economy in Saudi Arabia [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4183.4800000000005s)]
*  is one of the most prosperous economy, [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4186.4400000000005s)]
*  and it is some of the benefit of this economy. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4188.6s)]
*  It succeeded in overcoming the problem [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4194.08s)]
*  of dependence on foreign labor. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4199.08s)]
*  Many young Saudis who were educated here and elsewhere [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4201.36s)]
*  returned to Saudi Arabia with great ideas [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4204.759999999999s)]
*  and they started some information entrepreneurship. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4208.24s)]
*  Some of it even become successful here in America. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4212.92s)]
*  There was a Saudi who launched a very cynical app [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4216.36s)]
*  where allows people to receive frank opinions [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4222.44s)]
*  from their friends without knowing their friends. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4226.36s)]
*  I don't advise anybody to do this. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4232.04s)]
*  It is called Saraha and it had become popular [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4235.48s)]
*  even throughout the world. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4239.08s)]
*  But back to your question about the vision [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4241.759999999999s)]
*  to create our own Silicon Valley. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4245.16s)]
*  What worries me about Vision 2030, [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4251.84s)]
*  it is based on the Dubai model. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4255.36s)]
*  The Dubai model, it is like Walt Disney [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4258.08s)]
*  standing over a huge map of future Disneyland [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4261.76s)]
*  and he and a few consultants around him, [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4266.76s)]
*  they are the one who decide where to put this [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4270.6s)]
*  and where to put that. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4273.16s)]
*  In Dubai, they did that. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4276.16s)]
*  Muhammad bin Rashid Al Maktoum built this beautiful city, [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4278.72s)]
*  Dubai, to serve Saudi Arabia and Iran and Russia [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4282.88s)]
*  and everybody and it had become a success. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4286.2s)]
*  Can we do the same thing in Saudi Arabia [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4289.36s)]
*  where MBS stand and plan where to build a Disneyland [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4292.32s)]
*  and where to build a Silicon Valley? [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4300.4s)]
*  I would much rather those things to be built [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4304.12s)]
*  from the bottom up by the people, [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4307.16s)]
*  by the needs of the project. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4309.679999999999s)]
*  So we will not end up with more elephant projects. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4312.24s)]
*  We already have King Abdullah city near Jeddah [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4315.64s)]
*  which is struggling to succeed. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4321.240000000001s)]
*  We spend billions there. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4324.360000000001s)]
*  It is a government initiative. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4327.56s)]
*  Right in the center of Riyadh, if you go to Riyadh, [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4329.08s)]
*  you will drive by King Abdullah Financial District. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4331.88s)]
*  It's about what, 50, 60 buildings, it's a small city. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4336.0s)]
*  And now the government is struggling [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4341.04s)]
*  how to bring people into, how to move business [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4343.64s)]
*  from downtown Riyadh into the financial district [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4346.92s)]
*  which the cost of rent double or triple the cost [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4353.320000000001s)]
*  those Saudi businesses pay elsewhere. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4360.8s)]
*  I think we should treat Saudi Arabia as a real country, [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4366.96s)]
*  not a Disneyland. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4371.84s)]
*  If the government should be a regulator, support. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4374.04s)]
*  It had in the past lead into building the country. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4380.0s)]
*  Now they need to step back and play the role [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4387.160000000001s)]
*  of a government, not the role of a developer, [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4391.04s)]
*  the role of a regulator. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4395.240000000001s)]
*  And let the people build what they think is the right way. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4398.08s)]
*  And that's what is needed. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4403.72s)]
*  So we will not, we have lost so much, [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4404.96s)]
*  a huge amount of money in mega projects. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4408.360000000001s)]
*  They were totally unneeded. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4411.88s)]
*  Moudar, comment on the possibility [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4418.56s)]
*  of a Palestinian Silicon Valley [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4420.84s)]
*  in the shadow of the Israeli Silicon Valley. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4422.400000000001s)]
*  I think I have three different answers for this question. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4428.84s)]
*  The first is that actually there were very serious plans [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4432.04s)]
*  to develop high tech industry in Palestine for two reasons. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4434.68s)]
*  One is to act as a bridge between the Israeli Silicon Valley [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4439.72s)]
*  and the Gulf and other Arab countries. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4442.72s)]
*  It's failed for political reasons. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4445.0s)]
*  And the other was a very interesting, [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4447.44s)]
*  it's quite stupid but interesting fantasy [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4451.56s)]
*  of finding a way to develop the economy without land. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4454.12s)]
*  So I mean, so what is the sort of the least space, [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4459.28s)]
*  space demanding kind of activity in the world, [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4464.799999999999s)]
*  it's virtual work. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4468.679999999999s)]
*  So if you get especially Jerusalemites, [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4470.599999999999s)]
*  that was the plan that was developed, [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4473.24s)]
*  especially Jerusalemites to engage in high tech production, [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4475.28s)]
*  programming, et cetera, et cetera, [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4479.36s)]
*  you will not need to expand the Arab areas in Jerusalem [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4481.36s)]
*  for providing jobs for Arab. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4486.16s)]
*  So you can keep expanding West Jerusalem [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4490.56s)]
*  without expanding East Jerusalem [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4492.92s)]
*  if you get the East Jerusalemites to focus on. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4494.64s)]
*  But it was so stupid that it simply didn't, [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4496.92s)]
*  I mean, it didn't go out of the drawers [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4499.68s)]
*  and the discussions in smaller meetings than this one. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4502.36s)]
*  But I mean, this took place pretty much in the late 90s, [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4506.08s)]
*  early, about 10, 15 years ago, [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4509.16s)]
*  it was a fantasy. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4512.96s)]
*  What one can notice easily about high tech industry, [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4516.88s)]
*  I mean, look, it's very successful in India, right? [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4521.32s)]
*  Russia, so I think it will have room to be successful [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4524.4800000000005s)]
*  in Egypt but not in Palestine. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4528.2s)]
*  In Jordan it failed and there was quite a bit [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4529.84s)]
*  of investment by the way in Jordan and it failed [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4531.84s)]
*  because I think high tech industry [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4534.76s)]
*  depends on critical masses. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4536.4s)]
*  It's a place where 1,000 people work, [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4538.96s)]
*  990 of them do not really produce anything [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4543.56s)]
*  but the 10 who produce something which Google [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4546.320000000001s)]
*  or Microsoft or somebody like that would buy [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4549.4800000000005s)]
*  would make the whole difference for the whole thousand. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4551.84s)]
*  And you cannot succeed with it in small countries. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4555.4400000000005s)]
*  I think it's a bad project for small countries [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4559.240000000001s)]
*  like Palestine, Jordan, et cetera. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4561.240000000001s)]
*  I think Egypt is a very good candidate. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4563.400000000001s)]
*  Not to me. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4566.320000000001s)]
*  Israel doesn't produce high tech. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4568.04s)]
*  Israel is the hub. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4569.88s)]
*  Israel actually takes, they do have factors, et cetera, [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4571.599999999999s)]
*  but the R&D is not the programming work behind [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4575.5199999999995s)]
*  how Intel eventually in Cisco work. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4579.96s)]
*  Having a hub, a high tech hub, [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4583.28s)]
*  like what Israel has actually done, [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4588.92s)]
*  is you import know-how from all around [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4591.599999999999s)]
*  through the US, et cetera. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4595.8s)]
*  In Palestine, we cannot import even janitors [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4597.32s)]
*  because this will be almost the implementation [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4600.68s)]
*  of the right to return. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4602.56s)]
*  I mean, we don't have external labor, [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4606.04s)]
*  not to mention cheap or fancy or whatever. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4608.28s)]
*  I mean, we cannot do that. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4611.28s)]
*  But then look at the Jordanian experiment. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4613.24s)]
*  It completely failed, completely failed. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4615.64s)]
*  And people who went into this business in Jordan, [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4619.28s)]
*  in the south, in Badaba, in Balka, et cetera, et cetera, [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4622.56s)]
*  there was lots of social talk. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4626.88s)]
*  There was a very negative social impact [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4629.64s)]
*  because they were all seen as spies for Israel, [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4631.240000000001s)]
*  working for the Israeli high tech, et cetera, [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4636.080000000001s)]
*  which created some isolation for them. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4642.080000000001s)]
*  And it became sort of a secret kind of a job, et cetera. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4644.64s)]
*  Nonetheless, nonetheless, [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4650.84s)]
*  I think if there is no scientific base [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4652.04s)]
*  which needs a high population, [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4655.48s)]
*  I don't think it can work. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4657.48s)]
*  So it's a very good plan for big countries, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4659.92s)]
*  not for small countries like that. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4662.76s)]
*  Well, Tunisia has very high levels of investment [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4665.72s)]
*  in human capital. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4667.84s)]
*  Could this type of a model work in the Tunisian context? [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4668.84s)]
*  I think so. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4671.76s)]
*  It could really work. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4673.32s)]
*  Is it too small? [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4676.0s)]
*  Not enough. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4678.56s)]
*  It's medium. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4679.4s)]
*  Not enough small. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4680.4s)]
*  It's medium, but it can work, [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4681.24s)]
*  and there is a huge human capital, [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4683.08s)]

*  and engineering, and raw export in Europe. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4689.88s)]
*  And it could be even a hub when there is a political will [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4692.96s)]
*  and there is a comparative advantage for the region. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4697.0s)]
*  So we are going for it. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4700.4s)]
*  20, 20 or 22. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4703.76s)]
*  But they have other things, maybe better things to do. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4704.599999999999s)]
*  They produce very good food, shoes. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4707.16s)]
*  Tourism. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4710.88s)]
*  Tourism. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4711.72s)]
*  Tourism. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4712.56s)]
*  Tourism. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4713.4s)]
*  Tourism products. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4714.24s)]
*  Well, I mean, eventually, the thing is, [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4715.92s)]
*  what do we do with high tech if we're hungry? [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4718.4s)]
*  I mean, somebody has to produce food. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4720.6s)]
*  That's the problem of the future. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4722.24s)]
*  You will receive. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4724.28s)]
*  No point in it. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4725.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4725.96s)]
*  Yeah, I know, I know. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4726.8s)]
*  So we have many, many questions in only five minutes. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4728.4s)]
*  So can we take multiple questions, [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4731.4800000000005s)]
*  and then we'll just give our panel [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4733.12s)]
*  a very quick opportunity to respond. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4734.72s)]
*  So. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4736.72s)]
*  I'm Barbara Slavin from the Atlantic Council. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4740.4s)]
*  Thank you for your interesting remarks. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4745.12s)]
*  Jamal, you can't talk about economy in Saudi Arabia [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4747.52s)]
*  without also talking about foreign policy. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4750.4400000000005s)]
*  What are the prospects for resolving the quarrel with Qatar, [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4752.96s)]

*  Thanks. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4760.12s)]
*  Please, more questions. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4764.4s)]
*  I hope that, I don't know. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4765.72s)]
*  I'll make this quick. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4768.0s)]
*  Fouad Shah with the National Center for State Courts. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4769.28s)]
*  I struggle to try wrapping my head around [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4772.8s)]
*  the concept of democratic progress, democracy, [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4774.92s)]
*  and it being a sense of moving forward in the Middle East. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4778.0s)]
*  When there is an inheritance, [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4782.5199999999995s)]
*  inherent concept that state secrecy is acceptable, [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4785.84s)]
*  how do we discuss transparency, [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4789.36s)]
*  whether it's economic, socioeconomic, [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4791.08s)]
*  and political progress in the Arab world, Arab states, [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4792.96s)]
*  when, you could almost say culturally, [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4796.68s)]
*  we're willing to accept state secrecy [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4799.200000000001s)]
*  and the idea that leadership and governance [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4802.76s)]
*  does not need to be accountable, [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4805.400000000001s)]
*  whether your argument or belief is, [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4809.280000000001s)]
*  it's this idea that we trust our leadership, [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4812.12s)]
*  our sheikh, or our familial or social structure. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4814.6s)]
*  Hi, my, Sebastian Gaske also [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4822.6s)]
*  from National Center for State Courts. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4824.4800000000005s)]
*  I actually had a specific question for Madame Cherif. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4826.36s)]
*  You mentioned the importance of political will [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4830.5599999999995s)]
*  to be behind the, [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4833.759999999999s)]
*  to be one of the main drivers for the reform process [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4836.799999999999s)]
*  that you described, the process of gradual shift [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4839.96s)]
*  to private investment, [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4844.639999999999s)]
*  and I wanted to know from your experience within Tunisia, [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4846.24s)]
*  is there a consensus within most of the main Tunisian [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4849.88s)]
*  political actors, whether it be Nida Tunis or Inada, [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4855.24s)]
*  that this path to private investment needs to go forward, [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4859.36s)]
*  or is there opposition that could potentially, [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4864.4800000000005s)]
*  opposition that says no, we need a different approach? [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4869.32s)]
*  The last question, and then you guys will have [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4874.12s)]
*  just one minute. Last but not least, [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4876.04s)]
*  Michael Kutzig retires from Department of Agriculture, [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4876.88s)]
*  working on Middle East agriculture and economics. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4878.96s)]
*  I'll tell a very, very short story. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4882.4400000000005s)]
*  I lived in a country which is the largest country [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4885.240000000001s)]
*  in the world. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4886.4800000000005s)]
*  About four or five years ago, [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4887.56s)]
*  the Minister of Education was fired. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4888.84s)]
*  I asked my son, why is he fired? [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4891.160000000001s)]
*  They just graduated seven million people from the university. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4893.08s)]
*  He said, Dad, you don't understand something. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4896.56s)]
*  These people are not marketable. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4898.52s)]
*  And that's a huge problem. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4900.4800000000005s)]
*  So my question is, education, you talk about Israel, [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4901.76s)]
*  I'll give you a quick example in Technion [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4904.96s)]
*  and Ben Gurion University is a room smaller than this. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4907.240000000001s)]
*  Get into that room, they say to the students, [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4910.56s)]
*  and discuss anything that comes into your head, anything. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4912.5199999999995s)]
*  And these things are coming onto the world market now. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4915.879999999999s)]
*  That's the difference. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4918.5599999999995s)]
*  The difference is education and the value of education. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4919.879999999999s)]
*  And that's all I'll say. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4923.16s)]
*  So the question is, does the education system [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4924.759999999999s)]
*  turn out marketable people for the jobs that are needed? [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4928.4s)]
*  And what are those jobs? [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4931.4s)]
*  Thank you, very interesting discussion, thank you. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4932.799999999999s)]
*  So I know it's very unfair to ask you [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4935.32s)]
*  to sum up in one minute each, [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4936.839999999999s)]
*  but I'm going to ask you to make an attempt to do so. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4938.639999999999s)]
*  And Of, I'll start with you. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4941.36s)]
*  Okay. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4949.5199999999995s)]
*  That's okay. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4952.08s)]
*  So you have transparency, human capital development, [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4953.759999999999s)]
*  quality of education as issues on the table. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4957.12s)]
*  So many things. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4961.28s)]
*  I'm gonna start with education. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4962.5199999999995s)]
*  Improve and reform the education system [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4965.639999999999s)]
*  for better-oriented markets. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4968.88s)]
*  Just to give you two figures. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4972.2s)]
*  40% of graduates from social sciences are unemployed. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4975.88s)]
*  Only 20% of engineering are unemployed. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4981.44s)]
*  The main unemployment rate is just 15%. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4986.04s)]
*  But it's [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4992.04s)]
*  the double for the women. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4995.639999999999s)]
*  So it's much less secure for women. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=4997.88s)]
*  What we have to do is to work with the private sector [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5002.4800000000005s)]
*  to shape the education needs for the sector, [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5006.4800000000005s)]
*  for the labor market. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5011.0s)]
*  And now we are launching a program at the national level [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5013.08s)]
*  with all the universities. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5016.36s)]
*  We call it the 4C. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5018.12s)]
*  It's the Center of Competence, Competence, [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5019.4800000000005s)]
*  Competence Capabilities. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5022.6s)]
*  It's a center, a national center of capacities [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5027.92s)]
*  or competence capabilities, competencies. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5031.28s)]
*  It's like a virtual or real platform for all students [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5036.64s)]
*  to be sure that they can directly hide from university [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5041.52s)]
*  and match it from their capacities to the employment, [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5045.36s)]
*  to the employment, to the labor markets. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5051.0s)]
*  Second thing is about the private sector [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5053.8s)]
*  and how to shift to the private experience. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5056.2s)]
*  The problem before the revolution, [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5061.12s)]
*  there is so different monopoles in different sectors. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5064.12s)]
*  So to open the private sector, [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5067.96s)]
*  less licenses to give [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5070.76s)]
*  and authorize everyone to have the authorization [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5074.64s)]
*  to launch its own project. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5082.04s)]
*  Second thing is decentralization of the private sector, [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5084.56s)]
*  not everything in the capital. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5089.76s)]
*  And the creation of comparative advantages [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5093.4800000000005s)]
*  between the areas, from marginalized areas [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5099.4800000000005s)]
*  to cost of areas to be sure that people can get [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5103.4800000000005s)]
*  new sectors and launch a new project [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5107.0s)]
*  given value added in the chain of value. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5110.92s)]
*  Well, Mudar and Jamal, you've involuntarily [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5116.68s)]
*  ceded half your time to OFA, [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5118.76s)]
*  so I'm gonna ask you to just take 30 seconds each to sum up. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5120.32s)]
*  I'll just give two very, very brief comments. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5125.4800000000005s)]
*  On the question of secrecy, I mean, look, [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5128.52s)]
*  take Palestine, there are no secrets. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5130.76s)]
*  Really, there are no secrets. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5133.04s)]
*  I mean, there's always somebody sitting next [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5134.2s)]
*  to those decision makers who would take it off. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5136.56s)]
*  The question is not about what we know, [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5140.200000000001s)]
*  it's about how we use it [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5141.400000000001s)]
*  and how can we make people accountable. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5142.6s)]
*  And then the real question is, who is accountable to whom? [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5145.0s)]
*  Because if you're accountable to the people, [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5151.280000000001s)]
*  then you need the information. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5153.0s)]
*  If you're accountable to the very vague notion [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5153.96s)]
*  of international legitimacy or the world community [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5157.68s)]
*  or whatever, I don't know. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5161.8s)]
*  I mean, what information is needed and for whom. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5163.240000000001s)]
*  So it's not, the question is not about, [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5166.400000000001s)]
*  my point was, the question is not about information. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5168.32s)]
*  As such, the question is about in what system [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5170.799999999999s)]
*  is this information operating? [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5173.44s)]
*  Now, in higher education, let me say [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5176.0s)]
*  that the problem goes beyond marketability, so to speak. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5178.799999999999s)]
*  The higher education has became, [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5186.48s)]
*  did become a park for unemployment. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5189.599999999999s)]
*  So you delay the jobs. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5192.599999999999s)]
*  And this is a duty that you do. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5195.12s)]
*  Whatever you do, the ratio of employment after university [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5198.639999999999s)]
*  has to do with the capacity of the market [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5204.32s)]
*  and not with how much you can do marketable product. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5207.96s)]
*  There's only that much jobs in the market. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5211.48s)]
*  That's number one. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5216.16s)]
*  Number two, with the structural adjustment policies [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5217.0s)]
*  that took place for a while, [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5219.5199999999995s)]
*  it's quite a bit of impact there was on higher education. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5220.759999999999s)]
*  In a place like Palestine, [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5223.92s)]
*  where there was nothing to struggle for, [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5225.24s)]
*  we can't be conservatives. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5228.6s)]
*  There's nothing to maintain from the past. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5229.76s)]
*  We design everything, I knew at ease. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5232.0s)]
*  The tuition fees that our students pay [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5237.4400000000005s)]
*  compared to the per capita [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5239.68s)]
*  are at the max possible in the world. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5241.4400000000005s)]
*  And what our entrepreneurs get is a free product, [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5244.36s)]
*  educated with zero investment [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5248.64s)]
*  because they don't really pay taxes. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5250.72s)]
*  And the taxes they pay do not go into higher education. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5252.4400000000005s)]
*  And so if there was a taxation system [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5256.16s)]
*  where capitalists sort of pay for the investment [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5258.679999999999s)]
*  of creating these jobs and for creating these exports [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5264.0s)]
*  and then use them in the job, [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5267.599999999999s)]
*  your note will be a valid one. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5269.12s)]
*  But in the context, which was developed on purpose [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5272.16s)]
*  by a whole program that was called UIS or something, [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5275.96s)]
*  something about quality in university education [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5280.0s)]
*  that the World Bank has led in several countries [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5282.2s)]
*  in the global south, [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5285.240000000001s)]
*  that actually produced a situation [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5287.4800000000005s)]
*  whereby people are delayed from entering the labor market [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5289.96s)]
*  on the coast of their parents [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5293.64s)]
*  with the government has nothing to do with this [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5296.08s)]
*  and the big capital has nothing to do with this. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5298.52s)]
*  It doesn't work. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5301.0s)]
*  The other thing that I briefly would like to say here [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5302.92s)]
*  is that in a place, in a small place like Palestine, [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5305.56s)]
*  the total investment of capital, land, real estate, [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5308.96s)]
*  expertise and equipment in higher education [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5315.4800000000005s)]
*  is actually greater than any other industrial sector. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5318.6s)]
*  And nonetheless, we are supposed to see [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5322.6s)]
*  what the market needs, [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5327.12s)]
*  but we are not never considered part of the market. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5328.12s)]
*  The degree of investment in Palestinian higher education, [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5330.92s)]
*  to count buildings, land, equipment, labs, [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5333.72s)]
*  expertise, know-how, what have you, [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5336.96s)]
*  is much greater, for example, than the medical, [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5339.280000000001s)]
*  and the pharmaceutical industry, [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5344.28s)]
*  which is a successful thing for a strange reason in Palestine, [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5345.5199999999995s)]
*  or for dietary products in Palestine. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5348.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, it's larger than any of those sectors. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5352.96s)]
*  And nonetheless, nobody is asking us [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5355.48s)]
*  what kind of graduates do we need. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5358.36s)]
*  Samal. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5363.24s)]
*  All right, for Barbara's question, [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5364.36s)]
*  I think Saudi Arabia has reached a dead end [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5366.28s)]
*  in all those issues, and any different. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5368.799999999999s)]
*  President Trump always blamed Obama for withdrawing [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5372.28s)]
*  and not being effective in the region. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5376.0s)]
*  Then he should not make the same mistake, [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5378.28s)]
*  but he should leave it for the State Department, [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5380.759999999999s)]
*  not himself, to engage in those issues. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5382.88s)]
*  So thank you all so much for your conclusions [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5387.84s)]
*  and for your participation. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5394.84s)]
*  And please join me next door for lunch. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5396.32s)]
*  We will be reconvening in only half an hour, [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5399.0s)]
*  so it will be a very quick break. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5402.16s)]
*  So see you all back here at one o'clock. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRq6cjsVSjc&t=5403.4800000000005s)]
