# Sayigh on Police Reform in Egypt and Tunisia
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [April 22, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY)
*  Democratization in Arab countries is just not going to happen without reform of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=0.0s)]
*  security sector, the police, the intelligence agencies, the secret political police. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=15.0s)]
*  And unfortunately, although the Arab Spring provided a real opportunity for reform that [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=20.52s)]
*  The result of delaying reform was to encourage the security sector to retrench, regroup, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=27.04s)]
*  and go back on the offensive. That meant, for instance, the resort to torture, to the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=34.04s)]
*  routine use of violence, beatings, etc., when detaining suspects in order to extract confessions, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=40.04s)]
*  disregard of citizens' rights, freedom of expression, and so on. In other words, the revival of a [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=46.04s)]
*  culture of police impunity. And this ultimately led, in the case of Egypt, to a military coup d'etat [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=51.04s)]
*  in which the Interior Ministry was a key player, resulting in thousands of deaths and tens of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=58.04s)]
*  thousands of arrests without proper trial or warrant. In Tunisia, the case was not so dramatically [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  bad, but the security sector led by the Interior Ministry remains until today a black box, which [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  resists being opened up to proper accountability and oversight by the elected executive. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=78.04s)]
*  It's extremely important to neutralize the security sector, i.e. to take it out of partisan [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=85.04s)]
*  political competition. That means assigning neutral ministers who don't belong to any political [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=90.04s)]
*  camp. It means that each political party should accept that it will not directly control the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=96.04s)]
*  Interior Ministry on the understanding that, of course, that its rivals won't control it either. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=102.04s)]
*  And at the end of the day, that has to be part of a quid pro quo in which the security sector [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=110.04s)]
*  itself acknowledges government authority over it, over its policy, over its senior appointments, and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=116.04s)]
*  so on. So there has to be a package there. A second lesson, I think, from the experience of Egypt [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=122.04s)]
*  and Tunisia is the importance of balancing the need of the security sector for better budgets, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=129.04s)]
*  better pay, better pensions, better service conditions. Often you'll find policemen who are [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=138.04s)]
*  poorly trained, who work for 12 hours, 12 hours off, and then 12 hours on again, and may be [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=144.04s)]
*  assigned from traffic control to narcotics to all sorts of other tasks without appropriate training, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=150.04s)]
*  without no right of complaint against their superiors. So there's a whole issue of the rights [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=156.04s)]
*  of the personnel, the lower ranking, but also the officers of the security sector itself, of the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=162.04s)]
*  police, of the police on the beat. But in return for giving them better conditions, they have to [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=168.04s)]
*  accept that they are obligated to uphold the rule of law, to be accountable financially, politically, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=174.04s)]
*  to elected authorities. So there needs to be a package. The mistake in Egypt and Tunisia was that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=180.04s)]
*  new governments that came to power felt that they were weak. They didn't have an experience of [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=186.04s)]
*  governing. They had weak legitimacy. So they chose to appease the security sector, not rock the boat, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=191.04s)]
*  not seek reform, and instead they awarded pay increases without expecting delivery in improved [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=199.04s)]
*  performance, improved crime fighting, improved adherence to the law. And that was a fundamental mistake. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzEH7wlVBY&t=205.04s)]
