Video Description: Nuclear nonproliferation in the Middle East is a major policy challenge for President Joe Biden, who is eager to return to the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. Meanwhile, other states in the region—notably Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt—have either initiated or advanced their nuclear programs during the past few years. This may constitute a security challenge, given the reality of ongoing regional polarization. Will the new administration's Iran policy have an impact on nonproliferation in the Middle East? How will it address nuclear proliferation is other states in the region?

Join us on Thursday, February 4 from 10:00-11:00 a.m. EST (5:00-6:00 p.m. Beirut) for a public panel discussion with George Perkovich, Laura Rockwood, and Alex Vatanka, chaired by Maha Yahya. The event will be held in English and livestreamed on YouTube and Facebook.

# Nuclear Diplomacy: Biden's Middle East Aspirations
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [February 04, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg)
*  Good afternoon everybody and welcome to Carnegie, Malcolm Kerr, Carnegie Middle East Center's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=0.0s)]
*  panel on nuclear diplomacy and Biden's Middle East aspirations. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=8.28s)]
*  As you all know, the challenge of nuclear proliferation has been looming large both [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=14.22s)]
*  globally but no more and more so than the Middle East. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=18.34s)]
*  Globally, 17 countries have launched a formal weapons program. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=21.72s)]
*  19 countries globally have produced a deliverable bomb and nine countries today [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=26.68s)]
*  possess nuclear arms. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=32.56s)]
*  They're the same as they were 25 years ago, but they're still a concern with [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=33.96s)]
*  potential proliferation. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=39.8s)]
*  In the Middle East, even though Iran's nuclear weapons program is the highest [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=42.6s)]
*  priority or is a high priority agenda for President Joe Biden's administration, other [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=47.0s)]
*  nuclear issues in the region and beyond abound. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=52.96s)]
*  In recent years, Saudi Arabia and China have publicly announced several joint nuclear [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=56.32s)]
*  projects in Saudi Arabia, including one to extract uranium from seawater with the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=61.0s)]
*  stated goal of helping the KSA develop a nuclear energy program or become a uranium [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=66.78s)]
*  exporter. In August, the UAE became the first Arab country to open up a nuclear power [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=72.28s)]
*  plant, raising concerns about the long term consequences of introducing more nuclear [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=77.4s)]
*  programs to the region. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=82.74000000000001s)]
*  And Israel's significant nuclear stockpile is perhaps the most open secret around, if [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=84.8s)]
*  anything. My name is Maaha Yahya. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=91.68s)]
*  I'm the director of the Malcolm H. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=94.08s)]
*  Kerr Carnegie Middle East Center. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=95.72s)]
*  I'm joined today by a wonderful group of experts on nuclear nonproliferation in the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=97.64s)]
*  region, as well as Iran's internal politics. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=102.6s)]
*  I'm delighted to welcome my colleague George Perkovich, who is the Ken Oliver, Olivier [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  and Angela Nomelini chair and vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment, where [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=112.4s)]
*  he also oversees the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=117.92s)]
*  Peace. I'm also delighted to welcome Laura Rockwood, who's the director of the Open [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=122.44000000000001s)]
*  Nuclear Network. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=127.86000000000001s)]
*  The aim of the network is to reduce the risk that nuclear weapons are used in response [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=129.56s)]
*  to error, uncertainty or misdirection, particularly in context of escalating conflict. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=134.4s)]
*  This is from their website and the previous conversation with Laura. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=139.96s)]
*  Finally, last but not least, I'm also delighted to welcome Alex Patanka, who is the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  director of the Iran program and senior fellow at our sister think tank, the Middle [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  East Institute in Washington. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=156.12s)]
*  So let me open with you, George, first against the background that I've just mentioned. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=158.68s)]
*  Can you tell us, say a few words about the status of nuclear proliferation globally and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=164.24s)]
*  in the Middle East in particular, and what can what steps can be taken to rein in [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=168.96s)]
*  nuclear proliferation? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=174.84s)]
*  Well, let me start a little bit on the background of not so much proliferation, but [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=176.88s)]
*  what's called the nuclear order. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=183.16s)]
*  So right now, the US and Russia, for example, together have 91 percent of the nuclear [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=184.8s)]
*  weapons in global stockpiles. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=191.8s)]
*  So clearly, there's a challenge there, and both of them are modernizing their forces. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=194.22s)]
*  They may not be increasing the numbers, but they're continuing to invest and and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=199.42s)]
*  improve, as it were, the technology. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=205.57999999999998s)]
*  You have China also increasing its nuclear capabilities, both qualitatively and [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=208.1s)]
*  quantitatively. We can talk about why. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=214.45999999999998s)]
*  And India and Pakistan also are continuing to build up and enhance their nuclear weapon [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=217.78s)]
*  capability. So there's kind of growth going forward. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=224.7s)]
*  These countries still have a sense that there are threats that require them to have these [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=229.57999999999998s)]
*  nuclear forces and capabilities. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=234.94s)]
*  And they're all getting a little more entangled with, for example, potential cyber [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=237.82s)]
*  weapons and capabilities which could threaten their command and control systems or dual [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=244.29999999999998s)]
*  use conventional and nuclear missile systems and reconnaissance satellites and others. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=249.73999999999998s)]
*  So that if there's a conflict, the concern grows that even by accident or [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=255.29999999999998s)]
*  inadvertence, nuclear weapons could get implicated and you could have nuclear escalation. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=260.86s)]
*  So that's kind of the background amongst those that already have nuclear weapons in terms of [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=266.34s)]
*  proliferation, which we'll talk about this evening. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=270.66s)]
*  There, the primary concern is Iran and which way it will go. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=275.70000000000005s)]
*  Will it continue to control its restrain, its nuclear capabilities and not acquire [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=283.02000000000004s)]
*  nuclear weapons? That leads to one future. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=288.82000000000005s)]
*  If it doesn't, that leads to a different future. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=291.34000000000003s)]
*  And then the worry would be what other countries do. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=294.34000000000003s)]
*  And then lastly, North Korea, which is not going to give up nuclear weapons. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=296.74s)]
*  We can talk about that, too, and what could be done. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=303.34000000000003s)]
*  But the concern longer term than in Northeast Asia is whether Japan or South Korea or both of [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=305.94s)]
*  them at some point decide that maybe they need nuclear weapons. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=311.74s)]
*  So that's kind of the big picture, as I would describe. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=315.22s)]
*  Thank you, George. Laura? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=319.62s)]
*  Well, I think maybe I'll drill down a little bit on the Middle East. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=322.18s)]
*  Currently, there's no fixed definition of what constitutes the Middle East. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=326.38s)]
*  But the International Atomic Energy Agency uses the term members of the League of Arab States, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=331.06s)]
*  Israel and Iran. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=338.38s)]
*  And that currently amounts to 24 countries. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=340.26s)]
*  Now, of those 24, all but one are parties to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=343.5s)]
*  Twenty of them have in place their comprehensive safeguards agreements that are required by the NPT. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=349.82s)]
*  But only 10 of the countries in the region have additional protocols to their comprehensive [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=358.1s)]
*  safeguards agreements. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=365.90000000000003s)]
*  And an additional three have signed, among which, of course, is Iran, who's been which has been [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=367.98s)]
*  implementing its additional protocol provisionally. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=373.98s)]
*  So I think George has focused on two of the problem areas. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=377.66s)]
*  What happens if things go badly wrong with the relationship with Iran? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=383.58000000000004s)]
*  And how can the situation in North Korea be addressed? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=389.42s)]
*  And the problem that President Biden has right now is how to balance the many demands on his [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=394.3s)]
*  priorities. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=403.02000000000004s)]
*  In my view, Iran's a very high priority. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=404.26s)]
*  I think North Korea is pretty far behind. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=407.18s)]
*  Sorry, not too far behind. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=409.34s)]
*  But in terms of Iran, both President Biden and President Rouhani have a very tough road to [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=412.18s)]
*  hoe between now and February 21st, when the modulus has directed the president to stop [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=419.26s)]
*  implementing the additional protocol that Iran has in place. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=427.18s)]
*  And what I am concerned about is a precipitous action on the part of Israel, because you've been [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=430.58s)]
*  listening to Netanyahu really becoming more forceful in the language that he's using vis-à-vis Iran. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=436.7s)]
*  I'm not troubled by the introduction of nuclear power in the Middle East, because I think that can [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=444.94s)]
*  be managed. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=453.38s)]
*  But what we need to do is make sure that we have in place strong verification mechanisms, and that [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=455.38s)]
*  includes all of the countries in the region, ideally eventually Israel, but for the time being, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=460.82s)]
*  certainly all of the other countries, putting in place their required comprehensive safeguards [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=467.46s)]
*  agreements and putting into force, bringing into force additional protocols. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=472.62s)]
*  I think that would take some of the heat off the region. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=476.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=482.3s)]
*  Thank you, Laura. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=484.02000000000004s)]
*  Actually, that's a nice segue into to Alex. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=484.86s)]
*  I hope probably we'll zoom in a bit more on Iran. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=489.42s)]
*  We've already started the conversation. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=492.94s)]
*  We've gotten the conversation going. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=495.90000000000003s)]
*  Alex. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=497.26s)]
*  Sure. Thank you very much. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=498.26s)]
*  You know, I follow the Iranian debate more than anything else, even though I live here in [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=501.18s)]
*  Washington and I can't help but to come to the conclusion. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=506.22s)]
*  And for me, it's a pretty clear conclusion that and I don't think I'm going to surprise anyone by [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=512.3s)]
*  saying this, both the Biden administration and the Iranian regime wants a quick [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=516.66s)]
*  revival of the JCPOA of July of 2015. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=524.78s)]
*  There's no doubt about it in my mind. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=529.62s)]
*  And I think, you know, Laura just mentioned the Majlis and other Iranian [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=532.3s)]
*  actions in recent weeks have spoken, you know, to Iran's ability to increase the [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=538.42s)]
*  temperatures, if you will. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=545.7s)]
*  But if they are doing that and they clearly are doing that, they're doing it with one sole [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=547.54s)]
*  purpose in mind, which is to gain leverage, which is to bring the Biden administration as [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=552.14s)]
*  quickly as possible to the table of negotiations, because that's ultimately what what Iran [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=557.18s)]
*  wants to do. It's an increase in number of centrifuges, how much enriched material they [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=563.38s)]
*  hang on to, how many missile, new missile, generation of missiles they unveil and so [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=569.22s)]
*  on and so forth. I think if you look at the totality of what the Islamic Republic is today at [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=576.6999999999999s)]
*  home in the region and its relations with the United States, they actually have a lot less [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=581.5s)]
*  space for maneuver than might meet the eye. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=586.5s)]
*  And I think, you know, we will get to this, Maha, when we talk about domestic Iranian [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=589.54s)]
*  politics later on on the panel. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=594.26s)]
*  But a speech that the Iranian supreme leader gave yesterday, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, he [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=596.26s)]
*  you know, he said something that was very, I think, clear to anyone who paid attention. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=601.74s)]
*  He said to the entirety of the regime, that's the so-called moderates in the Hassan [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=606.62s)]
*  Rouhani government, including Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and to the generals in the [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=611.3s)]
*  Revolutionary Guards, he had one message. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=617.98s)]
*  And whether that message is going to be heeded or not, that remains to be seen. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=619.5s)]
*  But the message was, listen, and I'm going to basically summarize, stand together or [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=622.9000000000001s)]
*  fall. So the notion that the nuclear issue is going to be one that's going to be purely [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=627.58s)]
*  about domestic politics in Tehran, I don't know if they can afford that. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=634.5400000000001s)]
*  And I don't think Khamenei would allow that to happen if he has anything to say about [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=639.0200000000001s)]
*  it. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=643.2600000000001s)]
*  Let me stay with you, Alex, in this sense, because we've heard about how much [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=645.18s)]
*  enrichment. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=651.9s)]
*  I mean, Iran has really achieved critical levels of enrichment at this point. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=653.9s)]
*  And even in 2020, in January, actually, it had announced it will no longer be [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=660.38s)]
*  honoring any. I mean, it's increasing the number of centrifuges, et cetera. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=667.14s)]
*  So the Biden administration has signaled that it intends to include allies in the [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=670.54s)]
*  JCPOA negotiations, which means that the negotiations will cover issues such as [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=676.18s)]
*  Tehran's regional influence as well as its ballistic missiles. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=685.6999999999999s)]
*  And eventually this may indicate that negotiations will take longer. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=689.9s)]
*  Yet at the same time, as you've just indicated, there's a very tight timeline to [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=693.74s)]
*  contain Iran's nuclear program, given its previous restrictions, the way it's [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=699.94s)]
*  transgressions, but also what Khamenei said yesterday. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=707.86s)]
*  How do you see the administration reconciling both of those? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=712.74s)]
*  Let me quickly make a point about the fact that, as we all know, there's politics in [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=718.2600000000001s)]
*  every capital around the world. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=722.82s)]
*  That's true for Washington as it is for Tehran. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=724.2600000000001s)]
*  In terms of politics, it was very interesting. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=727.02s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during his confirmation that the United [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=729.62s)]
*  States returning to JCPOA of 2015 is a long way, a long, long way, something to that [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=736.78s)]
*  effect, that it's not going to happen overnight. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=745.74s)]
*  Basically, I don't want to misquote the man. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=747.18s)]
*  So but the point was this is not going to happen overnight. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=749.18s)]
*  And then we heard him, I think it was two, three days ago in an interview he gave to [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=752.3s)]
*  NBC. He said, Iran is a few weeks away from a nuclear bomb. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=756.42s)]
*  Basically, my point is the politics in Washington requires the Biden administration to [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=760.78s)]
*  cover every angle possible. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=767.42s)]
*  They don't want to give the anti-Iran critics of the JCPOA, the original JCPOA. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=770.02s)]
*  They don't want to give them any more excuses than necessary. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=777.42s)]
*  So we can witness in the next. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=780.9399999999999s)]
*  And we already have witnessed. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=782.5s)]
*  I mean, today's announcement of an Iranian diplomat being sentenced to 20 years, I [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=783.54s)]
*  think is something that the Europeans clearly coordinated with Washington. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=788.54s)]
*  It's part of the Western pressure campaign against Iran. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=791.9399999999999s)]
*  The Iranians aren't the only ones who can do the pressure campaign against the West. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=795.4599999999999s)]
*  Now, the Biden administration and the Europeans, with Trump being gone, can go back [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=799.3399999999999s)]
*  and play good cop, bad cop, whatever, pull the resources together. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=803.98s)]
*  But ultimately, both what Europe and the US wants is to go back and talk to the [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=807.2199999999999s)]
*  Iranians and see if they can get a deal. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=811.54s)]
*  I think, you know, in terms of timing, frankly, I think the Iranians have less time. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=814.62s)]
*  And I kind of hinted at that in my earlier remarks. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=821.18s)]
*  Ayatollah Khamenei will not be up for election in June of 2021. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=823.86s)]
*  So he, you know, the revolution guards and everybody else might think about the elections [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=828.9399999999999s)]
*  in Iran as that sort of pivotal moment, whether you have negotiations after those [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=833.06s)]
*  elections when Rouhani is gone or before. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=837.5799999999999s)]
*  But the reality is the Iranian economy is in such a dire straits that to take six [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=841.02s)]
*  months and delay possible sanctions relief that you can have tomorrow, wait for six [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=846.0600000000001s)]
*  months, that's a big risk for a regime that is literally sitting on a powder cake [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=851.5400000000001s)]
*  with a population of 85 million that is restless. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=855.82s)]
*  So I think, you know, it sounds all very good when they say we're not going to come [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=859.38s)]
*  back to the deal unless the United States comes back to the deal first. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=864.14s)]
*  But in reality, they have a lot less room to maneuver. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=868.0600000000001s)]
*  But let me also say this and I'll stop there. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=871.74s)]
*  If the United States and the West really want to go back and revive what's left of [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=874.82s)]
*  JCPOA, I mean, the best scenario and I love to hear what George and Laura have to say [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=879.34s)]
*  about it and your good self is to go back and do some kind of a temporary agreement [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=885.5s)]
*  of sorts, revive as much as possible of the sanctions of the JCPOA with the understanding [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=891.1s)]
*  that you are going to broaden the conversation the day after. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=898.9s)]
*  And I think the Iranians learned a lesson from the last five years just because the [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=903.42s)]
*  United States signs an agreement for good or bad doesn't mean the United States [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=907.54s)]
*  doesn't have the unilateral power to squeeze Iran economically the way the Trump [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=912.22s)]
*  administration proved that it can do going outside the United Nations and everything [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=917.06s)]
*  else. Just telling companies and countries stay out of Iran did the trick. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=920.74s)]
*  The Iranians learned that lesson. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=924.34s)]
*  So they know they know that just going back to JCPOA in itself is not going to help [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=925.66s)]
*  fix their economy. It's going to be a quick fix. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=930.3s)]
*  They might risk a few billions of dollars sitting in Asian banks in Korea, India and [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=932.38s)]
*  so on. But that's not a long term solution. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=936.0600000000001s)]
*  So, in other words, it's in the interest of Iran to want to have new rounds of talks [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=938.46s)]
*  that are broader and not just limited to the nuclear issue. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=943.3s)]
*  At the same time, the United States has to be careful to give them way out without [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=946.22s)]
*  humiliating them, basically a safe face saving option so they can come back and say [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=950.58s)]
*  they prevailed Trump laws. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=954.94s)]
*  But we're happy to talk to Biden and his team. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=956.54s)]
*  That's interesting, Alex. Let me turn to you, George, to comment perhaps on what [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=960.18s)]
*  Alex said. But the only thing I mean, we can come back to this later, Alex, is that [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=964.9s)]
*  the Iranian regime also is a master of buying time and maybe kicking the can down [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=972.26s)]
*  the road. So we need to kind of also look into how this might play in the in the [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=977.94s)]
*  logic. But let me turn to you, George, when maybe you comment on what Alex said. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=983.3800000000001s)]
*  And I'll come back to you, Laura, with a bit more questions on the JCPOA. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=987.3800000000001s)]
*  Well, I pretty much agree with the gist of what what Alex said in the sense that I [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=991.6600000000001s)]
*  think both sides have a clear interest in returning to the JCPOA. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=997.82s)]
*  Both might want more. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1007.06s)]
*  There are factions and interests in both that have different views. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1009.26s)]
*  It might have greater demands. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1013.3s)]
*  But both are better off with the JCPOA than without it. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1016.3s)]
*  And the JCPOA is a baseline. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1020.66s)]
*  And to return to that and then see what can happen after that and returning to that [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1023.66s)]
*  document is easier than starting from scratch or getting into negotiations to change [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1028.3799999999999s)]
*  it. So I think both get that it ought to be doable. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1035.26s)]
*  There's the the inevitable jousting or whatever the right metaphor is about who goes [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1039.06s)]
*  first. This shouldn't be a hard thing for intelligent people to solve. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1044.4199999999998s)]
*  And Foreign Minister Zarif is one of the smartest people I've ever known. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1049.58s)]
*  Secretary Blinken is extremely intelligent, as are their teams. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1054.5s)]
*  There are ways you can get escrow. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1059.34s)]
*  The Europeans can escrow something. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1061.34s)]
*  You each can make a step with third parties. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1063.34s)]
*  This is ought to be doable. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1066.4599999999998s)]
*  So then the question would be, OK, what happens after that? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1070.06s)]
*  And here, I think certainly I think most people who are deeply involved would wish [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1073.3799999999999s)]
*  that what Alex has suggested will be the case, which is to say that Iran would be [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1081.86s)]
*  interested in a broader kind of opening or rapprochement, whatever, again, the right [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1088.18s)]
*  word is that goes beyond just the nuclear file. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1095.1000000000001s)]
*  But I think people are skeptical in part because of what happened after 2015. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1100.9s)]
*  And so, you know, we'll have to wait and see. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1108.3400000000001s)]
*  And there, my guess, and Alex knows all of this and so do many of your viewers better [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1111.42s)]
*  than I. You know, how would the Iranian elections affect kind of the next steps or [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1115.94s)]
*  the broader engagement over the next year, two years on Iran's behavior, the broader [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1122.78s)]
*  sanctions, reassurances against unilateral U.S. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1131.9s)]
*  pressure, all of those kinds of issues are very difficult to predict. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1136.78s)]
*  And we also lastly, I'd say we don't know whether Bibi Netanyahu is going to be the [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1142.02s)]
*  prime minister of Israel in this period that we're talking about or what the disposition [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1146.74s)]
*  in Israel would be, which to me, last thing would be that's all the more reason to get [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1153.26s)]
*  back into the JCPOA to have that as a baseline. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1157.74s)]
*  And then we can deal with these uncertainties going forward. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1161.26s)]
*  We're going to come back to the internal how the internal politics might impact the [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1165.9s)]
*  Iran deal. And I think we also need to have a conversation. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1170.5s)]
*  We at least we have a sense of what Iran would be looking for, but the regional element [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1173.14s)]
*  Israel, but also what the Gulf countries will be looking for. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1178.9s)]
*  And this idea of tying the nuclear to the regionals, Iran's regional behavior is [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1182.58s)]
*  something I think we need to discuss perhaps in a little bit. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1189.18s)]
*  Laura, let me come back and move to you. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1191.82s)]
*  Maybe you want to comment on what George said, but also if you can say a few words [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1194.42s)]
*  about what you see as the new dynamics of the previously split relationship between [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1199.9s)]
*  the United States and its European allies over the last four years under President Trump. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1206.8200000000002s)]
*  So on the one hand, Europeans have to need to overcome some differences amongst [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1212.94s)]
*  themselves on many aspects of the Iran policy and sort of tagging onto this. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1217.8200000000002s)]
*  Do you see a post-Brexit UK perhaps moving closer to a US position or would it still [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1224.8200000000002s)]
*  stay within the same family? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1236.02s)]
*  How do you see the dynamic evolving? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1238.14s)]
*  There are so many moving parts right now. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1240.5s)]
*  Fundamentally, I think the Europeans have tried mightily to retain as much of the [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1244.3400000000001s)]
*  JCPOA as they could. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1252.1s)]
*  And unfortunately, we have this long arm of US secondary sanctions that has, I think, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1253.5s)]
*  as Alex pointed out, has really discouraged any investment in Iran, which has kind of [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1259.4599999999998s)]
*  defeated the purpose and one of the purposes, at least Iran's purpose, JCPOA. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1264.3799999999999s)]
*  And the question about whether a post-Brexit Europe will move more closely to a US [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1270.02s)]
*  perspective or further away is really going to depend on what is eventually defined as [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1275.82s)]
*  the US objective or objectives. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1282.1399999999999s)]
*  Right now, nobody has that very clear. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1285.1799999999998s)]
*  And I suspect among those who don't have it clear yet is the Biden administration. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1288.06s)]
*  Because of these so many moving parts, the Middle East is a really tough neighborhood [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1294.3s)]
*  and everything impacts everything else. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1300.54s)]
*  So, you know, if there's you look at this so-called Trump initiative to create peace [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1304.3s)]
*  in the Middle East where you have these countries, you have Israel versus Iran, you [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1310.9s)]
*  have the Arabs versus Iran, it's just very complicated. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1316.1000000000001s)]
*  And now you see Israel and the Arab countries in some fashion or another, some kind of [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1320.7s)]
*  rapprochement. So there are just so many moving parts that I think it's going to take [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1327.22s)]
*  the Biden administration some time to figure out what their objectives are. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1334.0600000000002s)]
*  But I think both both Alex and George have impressed how important time is and maybe [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1340.62s)]
*  less important for the United States and more important for Iran. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1348.1399999999999s)]
*  And what I fear is that if if that takes too long to get the negotiations started, you're [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1353.1s)]
*  going to have, as I suggested earlier, possibly a precipitous military action on the part [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1360.5s)]
*  of Israel. And I think with that, all bets would be off. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1366.74s)]
*  So I also am not as optimistic, perhaps as George and Alex might be, that Iran would [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1371.54s)]
*  even contemplate putting ballistic missiles on the table or the regional situation on [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1379.5800000000002s)]
*  the table. But it wouldn't surprise me if the more moderate regime would be willing [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1385.78s)]
*  to talk about it. But I don't think I think it would be difficult for them to publicly [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1392.02s)]
*  admit that they are willing of initial to put their ballistic missile program on the [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1398.98s)]
*  table or to talk about other activities in the region. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1405.22s)]
*  I hope I'm wrong. And but one thing I did like was what George talked about. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1408.58s)]
*  We have really smart people on at least both sides of those fences in terms of Iran and [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1413.3799999999999s)]
*  the United States. And I hope they're talking to each other already. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1418.26s)]
*  I really do. I hope there are back channels where these people are able to have [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1422.7s)]
*  conversations about where the soft points are, where the pressure points are, because [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1427.98s)]
*  there's not a lot of time left for the Iranian government. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1433.86s)]
*  I suspect these back channels have already started anyway, one hopes. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1438.98s)]
*  But just on the mentions, as we both you and George have mentioned the issue of Israel, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1444.54s)]
*  let me turn to you, George, and ask, you know, we've been hearing that officials in [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1450.1s)]
*  the incoming Biden administration have already updated Israel about the talks they've [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1455.8999999999999s)]
*  been holding with Iran on the JCPOA. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1459.98s)]
*  What would Israel ask of the Biden administration? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1463.54s)]
*  What kind of I mean, it's clear that the Biden administration is trying to avoid if [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1467.74s)]
*  these reports are true, will try to avoid what was seen as a mistake of the Obama [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1472.3s)]
*  administration, that is having talks without alerting any of their allies in the region [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1478.78s)]
*  about these talks. So if they are now alerting them, updating them, what is it that [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1484.02s)]
*  Israel would be asking? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1489.78s)]
*  Do you think of the Biden administration? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1492.6599999999999s)]
*  Well, Israel will be asking for all sorts of things that are probably unattainable and, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1495.3s)]
*  you know, fine. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1501.06s)]
*  And I think, you know, the US should listen and then do what's attainable. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1503.86s)]
*  You know, it in other words. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1508.9s)]
*  It's unclear, for example, and you see this in Washington, there's a faction in [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1511.94s)]
*  Washington that has a Likud view as well, which is that there's there the nuclear [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1517.7s)]
*  issue, while important, is nowhere near sufficient. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1526.1000000000001s)]
*  And also, you know, changing Iran's behavior actually isn't really sufficient [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1531.94s)]
*  unless it's changed in 12 ways that make for a total personality transplant and [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1541.26s)]
*  government transplant. In other words, they want regime change. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1548.78s)]
*  They want a different Iran. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1552.46s)]
*  They don't say what that would look like. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1555.14s)]
*  They don't offer a theory of how that would all of a sudden be friendly towards Israel [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1557.18s)]
*  or that it would give up nuclear technology. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1562.38s)]
*  There's no kind of answer to that. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1564.34s)]
*  And it hasn't been clear what Bibi wants from the very beginning. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1567.38s)]
*  So except everything. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1571.74s)]
*  And so that's not that's not going to be possible. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1574.34s)]
*  So I think, you know, they'll listen and then the issue will be, OK, what can you get [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1577.22s)]
*  now? And to be wary, to understand the proper Israeli concerns about the limitations [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1583.1s)]
*  of the JCPOA, the areas in which it didn't get everything that you would want. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1589.78s)]
*  Well, fine. So can you build upon that? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1595.26s)]
*  Concerns about missiles. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1598.1399999999999s)]
*  That'll all be heard. But I don't think that the US can somehow magically satisfy [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1600.02s)]
*  what Israel wants because Bibi is going to want fundamentally Iran to go away. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1606.2199999999998s)]
*  And that's just not one of the options. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1610.98s)]
*  Alex, on this note, let me let me turn to you and maybe talk a little bit more about [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1616.3s)]
*  the internal politics within within the US. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1625.8600000000001s)]
*  I mean, you've written about the integral role of the Iran of the revolution regards. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1630.5s)]
*  To what extent is the nuclear program tied to the IRGC so that moving away from the [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1635.5s)]
*  JCPOA to widen the scope of an agreement with Iran could constitute a red line for [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1644.26s)]
*  the IRGC and make therefore progress all the more unlikely. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1650.94s)]
*  And then more immediately, you've already started addressing this, which is how the [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1657.7s)]
*  June presidential elections could impact negotiations. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1661.58s)]
*  Let me start with the latter part of the second point you just raised and I'll come [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1665.98s)]
*  back to the question. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1671.94s)]
*  I mean, look, I don't want to say Iranian elections are entirely pointless, but it's [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1674.38s)]
*  really important for all of us to remember this. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1680.58s)]
*  Recall, because we all know this, candidates who run for office in Iran are pre-approved [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1683.42s)]
*  by the office of the supreme leader. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1688.98s)]
*  Right. So no candidate is going to come from the street and say, I have [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1691.42s)]
*  great ideas, let me run, I win. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1694.9s)]
*  Every single candidate will be pre-approved. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1697.42s)]
*  Not only the person will be approved, their agenda has to be approved by the Guardian [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1700.1000000000001s)]
*  Council. So you have, in a sense here, you know, a wonderful show for people, but it [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1704.22s)]
*  is what it is. It's a show. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1710.1000000000001s)]
*  It's a political show. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1711.46s)]
*  It's Ayatollah Khamenei for 30 years, giving the world something to look forward to, I [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1712.66s)]
*  guess, every four years with these elections. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1718.8200000000002s)]
*  Iranian people know that when it comes to key policy matters, there is continuity because [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1720.78s)]
*  the supreme leader's office is there and has been occupied by one individual named [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1727.06s)]
*  Ali Khamenei since 1989. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1733.8600000000001s)]
*  And that continuity is going to stay there more or less till he leaves this world. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1737.06s)]
*  So I think I just would be careful in terms of putting too much in the elections in [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1743.26s)]
*  Iran, whether much less or presidential. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1750.1s)]
*  Certainly, they don't they don't shape the key strategic policies, both domestic or [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1752.86s)]
*  foreign. You could make the argument that decisions are made based on consensus in [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1757.82s)]
*  bodies like the Supreme National Security Council. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1762.3s)]
*  But even then, I'm doubtful. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1765.62s)]
*  Even then, I'm doubtful. If you read the memoirs of people like Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1767.1399999999999s)]
*  who was president for eight years, they openly say key decisions were made behind their [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1771.1s)]
*  backs. I mean, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad didn't know that Khamenei had sanctioned back, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1776.06s)]
*  attract to talks with the Americans in Oman. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1780.26s)]
*  He was the president. He didn't know about it. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1783.26s)]
*  So don't don't forget that there are key individuals who shape the picture on the [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1785.46s)]
*  Iranian side more than anyone else. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1789.46s)]
*  And elections are going to make that much of a difference. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1790.98s)]
*  What does make a difference are the pressures that are hurting the entire regime. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1793.54s)]
*  And I mentioned the economic pressures they're under. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1798.02s)]
*  I mean, this this last few years, you've had sanctions and a double whammy with the [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1801.26s)]
*  pandemic and, you know, corruption is now because of ways they have to go around [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1807.26s)]
*  evading sanctions. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1813.8999999999999s)]
*  You have institutional corruption inside the Islamic Republic, bringing officials in. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1815.42s)]
*  The image of the regime has never been this low. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1820.6599999999999s)]
*  And it doesn't really make concessions to the people. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1823.82s)]
*  I mean, it's not like the Iranian regime is softening its grip on Iranian people in [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1826.82s)]
*  terms of how they go about their lives. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1830.5s)]
*  It is actually doing the opposite because it has always believed that you you approach [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1832.42s)]
*  your challenges from a position of strength. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1837.18s)]
*  But now you asked about the Revolutionary Guards. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1840.7s)]
*  Look, these folks, the first generation Revolutionary Guards are now men in their [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1843.02s)]
*  early to mid 60s. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1848.78s)]
*  They were young men when they joined the ranks of the Revolutionary Guards in 1980 [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1850.22s)]
*  when they went to fight Saddam Hussein. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1854.86s)]
*  They have been in this business for 40 years and they are not going to leave the scene [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1857.3s)]
*  and get some, you know, Western educated Javad Zarif type to come in and get all the [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1861.86s)]
*  spoils of an Iranian economy that if it left its own potential would be a very healthy, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1867.1399999999999s)]
*  if not a rich economy. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1872.74s)]
*  So they want to be players going forward. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1874.1s)]
*  But are they making calculations that are different today than that was the case in [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1877.02s)]
*  2015? I think we're seeing signs of that. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1880.34s)]
*  You know, if you look at it, let's just go back to the June elections. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1883.82s)]
*  Every single prominent individuals who's put their name out to be a candidate is [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1886.98s)]
*  associated with the Revolutionary Guards. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1892.02s)]
*  Everyone. There's not a single one that is not from the ranks of the Revolutionary [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1894.02s)]
*  Guards or associated with them one way or another. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1897.66s)]
*  In other words, I think basically the next elections in Iran is a competition among [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1900.06s)]
*  hardliners, mostly coming from the Revolutionary Guard circles. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1904.74s)]
*  And the question is, what are they fighting about? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1908.62s)]
*  And one individual I can point to just as an example, who happened to be an oil [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1911.58s)]
*  minister for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in his second cabinet, his name is Rustam Qasemi, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1915.62s)]
*  who's oil minister. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1921.3s)]
*  And he just put his name out this week to be a candidate. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1922.46s)]
*  And the message he came out with, which was very interesting to me, at least as an [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1927.58s)]
*  Iran watcher, was there are people who think we can be an island to ourselves, that [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1931.58s)]
*  diplomacy is a waste of time. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1936.02s)]
*  And then he made the point, diplomacy equals jobs. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1938.38s)]
*  Job security is our job security. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1941.8600000000001s)]
*  In other words, they are seeing and openly admitting that unless they have new [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1944.7800000000002s)]
*  messages and new, you know, new proposal, alternative ways of living for the Iranian [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1949.74s)]
*  people, that their militant Islamist approach at home and in the region is just [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1956.3000000000002s)]
*  simply going to be a risky proposition in terms of whether they can continue and [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1962.94s)]
*  exist or not, particularly as there's less less money to go around. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1966.94s)]
*  So I do want to point that out, because people in Washington often don't want to [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1970.9s)]
*  talk about the black box that is Iranian politics is too convoluted. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1975.8200000000002s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1979.26s)]
*  And but it does matter and paying attention does matter. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1980.26s)]
*  And if the Biden administration, I'm not going to advocate for or against it, but [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1983.74s)]
*  if they decided to go for diplomacy and frankly, maximum pressure didn't work. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1988.18s)]
*  So that's really the only game in town at this point. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1991.98s)]
*  If they want to do it that way, one, they're accepting that there is this thing [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1994.86s)]
*  called Islamic Republic and it's going to come down, it's going to be the Iranian [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=1998.82s)]
*  people are going to bring it down. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2002.02s)]
*  And the way to bring it down is not through anything like the maximum pressure [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2003.58s)]
*  campaign. And then secondly, how do you give something to key stakeholders like [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2006.8999999999999s)]
*  the revolution guards, particularly the second generation, younger revolution [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2013.54s)]
*  guards who see themselves wanting to abstain power, have access to economic [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2016.82s)]
*  riches for years to come the way their dads did. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2021.02s)]
*  How do you keep them involved? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2024.1s)]
*  Because the alternative message for them is what happened in Iraq or elsewhere [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2025.3799999999999s)]
*  where they get wiped out, you're going to get all thrown out and a new regime will [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2029.22s)]
*  come in and you have nothing to show for it. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2032.34s)]
*  How do you basically try and bring them on board and convince them that the [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2034.5s)]
*  country has to go in a different direction on key policy matters, including [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2039.46s)]
*  the nuclear issue in terms of the region and so on. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2043.02s)]
*  And I think that's one of the biggest, if not the biggest challenge for the Biden [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2045.3799999999999s)]
*  administration, if they even have the cloud to go there. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2048.86s)]
*  This is a president who's got plenty to do at home in the United States. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2052.1s)]
*  How much capacity he has to do that sort of thing remains to be seen. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2055.8199999999997s)]
*  Well, I mean, this is you've kind of touched on a key issue I wanted to bring [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2060.5s)]
*  up, which is maybe I'll come back to you, George, with this, given that President [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2064.58s)]
*  Biden is going to be very preoccupied with domestic issues. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2068.62s)]
*  To what extent do you think they might not subcontract, but try and get either [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2073.42s)]
*  Europe, a country like France, to play a bigger role? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2081.8199999999997s)]
*  And we've seen what seems to be a French-American rapprochement on a number of [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2086.54s)]
*  issues, including Lebanon, actually. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2091.7799999999997s)]
*  So to what extent can a country like France perhaps play a bigger role in [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2094.22s)]
*  spearheading a return to the nuclear fight? [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2100.02s)]
*  And also, to what extent will countries in the region, I mean, they're not going [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2103.4599999999996s)]
*  to sit on the sidelines either. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2108.2999999999997s)]
*  So we come back to the problem of do we just firewall the nuclear file and work [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2109.9s)]
*  with that and then look at other issues? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2116.02s)]
*  Or do we need to look at parallel tracks happening at the same time, which is [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2118.98s)]
*  something that Jake Sullivan, our former colleague, had actually put out in an op [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2123.58s)]
*  ed as a potential way to go before he became national security advisor. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2128.3s)]
*  Well, Ma, I think the French government people who work on these issues are [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2133.7s)]
*  exceptionally talented. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2140.3799999999997s)]
*  They're absolutely first rate and all along have been deeply engaged on these [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2141.9399999999996s)]
*  issues, and I'm sure that the Biden team respects them enormously and they will [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2149.3799999999997s)]
*  coordinate and welcome France's role in all this. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2154.22s)]
*  At the same time, I think now as before, what French officials and others will [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2158.74s)]
*  find is the Iranians will say, well, what about the Americans? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2166.14s)]
*  You're telling me this, you're here. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2170.54s)]
*  Where are the Americans? [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2173.38s)]
*  What's their position? [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2174.58s)]
*  So fundamentally, there's a limit on how much French diplomats can do because [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2175.46s)]
*  the Iranians, the problem they have mostly is with the U.S. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2180.94s)]
*  And so the question will be, where's the U.S.? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2184.38s)]
*  So I think you do both. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2186.82s)]
*  With the Gulf, or let's primarily say, you know, the Saudis and the UAE, I think [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2190.02s)]
*  you're right to point out what Jake Sullivan had said in part because it makes sense. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2200.34s)]
*  Again, the idea is everything that you would want to work on will be more [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2206.46s)]
*  difficult if there's no nuclear agreement. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2213.5s)]
*  All right. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2216.34s)]
*  So get a nuclear agreement, which has already been negotiated. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2217.58s)]
*  If you get people back into it and then put a process in place, you know, to [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2221.34s)]
*  figure out how to adjust it or whatever, but that can be on a track. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2226.2200000000003s)]
*  Once you've done that, you can have other tracks that deal with [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2229.82s)]
*  the regional security issues. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2233.38s)]
*  I don't see them, you know, they'll talk about human rights. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2238.1s)]
*  There's not going to be a lot of talk about human rights. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2241.34s)]
*  There's not going to be a serious discussion about human rights as much as [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2243.42s)]
*  Iran would actually do itself some good by releasing the NAMAZIs among others. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2246.5s)]
*  There's no reason for them to be in jail. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2253.82s)]
*  They would get some goodwill for doing it, but that's an internal issue in Iran. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2255.78s)]
*  The missile issue, and I agree with Alex, Iran's not going to, and Laura, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2262.3s)]
*  the question about, you know, putting their missile program on the table. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2266.98s)]
*  I don't think that's the idea. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2270.38s)]
*  Could be again, separate expert level discussions about ranges, missile ranges, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2272.46s)]
*  about Iran wanting a space launch program, which is a legitimate thing [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2278.26s)]
*  to be launching satellites. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2283.1s)]
*  Great. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2284.58s)]
*  We can respect and acknowledge that and even work with that. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2285.1800000000003s)]
*  How do you delimit that from a missile program? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2288.54s)]
*  So each of these things can be done. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2291.98s)]
*  But I think they would best be done kind of in distinct channels [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2295.6600000000003s)]
*  by different groups of people. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2300.78s)]
*  And, you know, I haven't talked to Jake. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2303.78s)]
*  I don't know if that's what their plan is. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2305.6600000000003s)]
*  But I, you know, and he's smarter than I am. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2307.42s)]
*  But I think that he alluded to that kind of approach. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2309.26s)]
*  Makes sense to me anyway. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2313.7400000000002s)]
*  Thank you. The problem is, I think, from the perspective of the region, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2317.26s)]
*  concerns with Iran's behavior across the region is are quite high, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2320.26s)]
*  both their behavior, but also obviously the behavior of their different proxies, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2327.06s)]
*  whether in Lebanon, in Syria, in Iraq and across the board in Yemen. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2331.7400000000002s)]
*  So there is significant concern on that front. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2336.94s)]
*  But we'll see how things develop. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2342.9s)]
*  Laura, let me turn to you in this particular case, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2345.1s)]
*  considering your particular experience in this domain. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2348.58s)]
*  If a new deal is indeed struck with Iran, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2352.1s)]
*  how can the international community realistically verify [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2355.86s)]
*  that the country's nuclear program is peaceful? [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2359.2999999999997s)]
*  That's that's a real easy question to answer, Maha. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2365.42s)]
*  You just said that before. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2368.86s)]
*  No, no, I mean, I don't mean to be a cavalier about it. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2371.22s)]
*  The IAEA has been verifying the peaceful nature of nuclear programs for [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2374.82s)]
*  well, since 1970, since we put in place comprehensive safeguards agreements. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2381.42s)]
*  And with the additional protocol, it becomes [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2386.42s)]
*  it becomes even more effective to provide those kinds of assurances. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2389.94s)]
*  So even so, I hesitate to suggest that even without the JCPOA, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2394.7000000000003s)]
*  if Iran were to continue to implement its comprehensive [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2399.9s)]
*  safeguards agreement and its additional protocol, [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2403.78s)]
*  we would still be better off than we were before the JCPOA. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2406.54s)]
*  What the JCPOA would give us, if if we could go back to full compliance [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2411.1000000000004s)]
*  with it, is some additional [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2415.9s)]
*  verification measures that aren't routine practice under [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2419.94s)]
*  routine safeguards, if you will. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2423.86s)]
*  But it's what it's the IAEA's bread and butter, and it can do it. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2425.7400000000002s)]
*  And if it has the additional measures given to it, again, by the JCPOA, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2430.46s)]
*  it makes the confidence level in the assurances that the agency gives [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2436.1400000000003s)]
*  even higher. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2440.7400000000002s)]
*  And frankly speaking, I think that's in Iran's interest. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2442.26s)]
*  Now, it's not as simple as that. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2445.66s)]
*  But the more confidence, the higher the confidence level [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2448.46s)]
*  with which the agency can draw conclusions about the peaceful nature [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2452.34s)]
*  of Iran's program, the better. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2456.26s)]
*  Now, mind you, they are still in the process of trying to verify [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2458.3s)]
*  whether Iran has declared everything. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2461.82s)]
*  That's not that's not a short process in any country [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2464.66s)]
*  and particularly not in a country that has extensive nuclear [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2467.9s)]
*  fuel cycle activities. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2471.3s)]
*  It's still underway. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2472.94s)]
*  The more transparent the more the more access Iran gives, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2474.78s)]
*  the easier it will be eventually for the IAEA to draw [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2479.26s)]
*  what you will have heard described as the broader conclusion, meaning that all [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2482.7000000000003s)]
*  nuclear material in Iran has been declared and placed under safeguards. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2487.86s)]
*  So it's a it's a long road in any country. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2492.6600000000003s)]
*  But when you have this deficit of trust, it's even harder. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2496.54s)]
*  But it is what the agency does. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2499.42s)]
*  It is what the IAEA actually does. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2501.0600000000004s)]
*  And in terms of the work you're doing as part of the network, are there [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2504.46s)]
*  is there any anything you're doing with regards to the potential of nuclear [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2508.7000000000003s)]
*  proliferation and the conflict that is teetering, sorry, in a region [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2512.6600000000003s)]
*  that is teetering on the verge of conflict all the time? [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2517.1800000000003s)]
*  Well, it's interesting. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2521.54s)]
*  Open nuclear network is really it's neither pro disarmament [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2522.5s)]
*  nor pro deterrence. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2525.86s)]
*  It's really designed for conflict de-escalation, particularly among countries [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2527.02s)]
*  where if the escalation get that the conflict gets out of hand, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2532.1800000000003s)]
*  nuclear weapons could be used by accident. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2535.86s)]
*  I firmly believe that the greater risk of the use of nuclear weapons [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2539.46s)]
*  is going to be by accident rather than as a tool of state to state war. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2543.86s)]
*  And we are initially focusing on the Korean Peninsula, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2550.7000000000003s)]
*  which has its own set of issues. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2554.7799999999997s)]
*  But if we are able to prove that we can add value there [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2557.02s)]
*  in terms of conflict de-escalation, I think the Middle East would be [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2560.5s)]
*  an obvious next place to turn. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2564.4199999999996s)]
*  So the idea is making making more information available [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2566.8599999999997s)]
*  that is not biased, that is factually based. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2571.9399999999996s)]
*  And you put that into the hands of decision makers [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2574.8199999999997s)]
*  independently of what their intelligence communities can do. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2577.74s)]
*  We don't compete with an intelligence community. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2581.3399999999997s)]
*  But to be able to give them mechanisms for talking with their adversaries [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2583.86s)]
*  and even sometimes within their own governments that isn't based [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2589.2200000000003s)]
*  on classified information or sources. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2593.34s)]
*  So that's what we're trying to do. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2596.1800000000003s)]
*  And hopefully, if it works in the Korean Peninsula, we'd be able to put some weight [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2597.66s)]
*  behind the Middle East conflict as well. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2602.66s)]
*  Thank you for asking. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2605.58s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2607.9s)]
*  Alex, let me turn to you and ask, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2609.42s)]
*  do you think that Iran could be the first step for a wider [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2613.9s)]
*  non-proliferation efforts in the region? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2618.46s)]
*  And I'll ask George to answer the same question as well. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2622.94s)]
*  George and Laura are the experts to ask on the issue of non-proliferation. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2626.98s)]
*  But I can tell you, when I look at it again as an Iran watcher, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2632.1s)]
*  but not an expert in the field of nuclear proliferation, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2635.62s)]
*  the thing that stands out for me, for example, is [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2639.8199999999997s)]
*  I believe the Tehran going back to early 70s when the Shah was around, [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2643.18s)]
*  has been asking for nuclear [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2647.74s)]
*  weapons free Middle East for a long time. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2652.06s)]
*  So that's not a new policy. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2655.5s)]
*  But from a practical point of view, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2657.98s)]
*  you could see in the best case scenario situation, [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2660.86s)]
*  let's just say, because we talked about it, George and Laura talked about it too. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2665.62s)]
*  And you referred to it, the missiles issue. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2669.86s)]
*  Jawad Zarif said, I think it was with Christine Amanpour, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2674.02s)]
*  that we could potentially talk about the missiles, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2678.2200000000003s)]
*  but then we also have to talk about the flow of American arms [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2682.62s)]
*  going to the other side of the Persian Gulf. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2685.2200000000003s)]
*  It was the first time that I remember, I might be wrong on this, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2687.8199999999997s)]
*  but at least in recent times, where there was a connection between [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2691.7799999999997s)]
*  what Iran is doing in terms of a range of its missiles and so forth [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2696.18s)]
*  and saying, what about all the platforms Americans are selling to countries like Saudi Arabia? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2700.7s)]
*  I think that could be a signal of sorts that, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2708.9399999999996s)]
*  if Iran agrees to broaden the conversation, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2713.5s)]
*  once you give them a face saving option [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2716.5s)]
*  and you have enough confidence to broaden the conversation, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2720.1s)]
*  then you can start small with some of the things that Iran is concerned about. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2724.02s)]
*  Because this is a key issue. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2729.98s)]
*  When we talk about broaden the conversation, I think it's entirely wrong [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2731.22s)]
*  to assume is a flood of concessions demanded off Tehran [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2734.9s)]
*  and the Iranians are asking from others. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2739.06s)]
*  I think if they're actually willing to engage in that conversation, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2741.7s)]
*  they can ask their neighbors about certain things that Tehran is concerned about. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2744.42s)]
*  Iran is a large country, 85 million people, the size of Alaska. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2748.78s)]
*  It has legitimate rights like any other country in the Middle East. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2752.58s)]
*  It's what Iran does with some of its resources [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2755.98s)]
*  that is of concern, as Mahayou pointed out to so many of those neighbors. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2759.34s)]
*  But the Iranians can also raise issues that they are concerned about. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2763.46s)]
*  So I think, in effect, having to broaden the conversation is not only useful, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2766.26s)]
*  it's also a must. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2771.26s)]
*  I mean, if you listen to officials from countries like UAE, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2772.22s)]
*  they will say, for example, they want that to have that conversation with Tehran, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2774.98s)]
*  but they also want the Americans at the table, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2779.54s)]
*  which is something the Iranians for a long time have refused to accept. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2781.74s)]
*  But here's an opportunity. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2785.4599999999996s)]
*  You've got a Biden presidency who wants to be creative, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2786.62s)]
*  who wants to think about how not only to revive the JCPOA, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2789.58s)]
*  but broaden the conversation to make Rappo Shimon something sustainable going forward. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2792.3799999999997s)]
*  To do that, you've got to talk about other issues than just centrifuges. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2798.62s)]
*  I think. But I mean, final point I make, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2802.18s)]
*  when it comes to the region as a whole, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2805.74s)]
*  and I'm not going to defend the Israeli nuclear program, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2808.7799999999997s)]
*  but Iran cannot ask for an initiative aimed at weapons-free Middle East [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2812.42s)]
*  when Iran is the country that doesn't recognize a member state in the Middle East, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2818.42s)]
*  namely Israel, as a fellow UN member. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2822.86s)]
*  So they can have all the agreements they won with the Gulf States [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2825.5s)]
*  or Turkey for that matter. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2829.7799999999997s)]
*  But I mean, the Israeli issue will be there. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2831.7799999999997s)]
*  And since we know the relations between Israel and the Islamic Republic are so contentious, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2833.7799999999997s)]
*  then it just sort of raises the issue, what happens at the very end? [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2839.22s)]
*  If everything else falls into place, what happens to the Israel question? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2842.98s)]
*  And I don't think the Iranians have thought about that, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2846.58s)]
*  what they have, because they know fundamentally what they have to do is to recognize [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2849.58s)]
*  at least Israel's right to exist. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2853.5s)]
*  They have all sorts of quarrels about their policies, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2855.42s)]
*  but to recognize Israel's right to exist seems to me to be the smartest way of going forward. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2858.26s)]
*  But actually, I'm asking of the impossible of the Islamic Republic, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2862.9s)]
*  since it's a core policy matter for them. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2866.38s)]
*  I just want to just tag on to this question. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2870.38s)]
*  There's a question from the audience, from someone called Bashar Bashar, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2873.86s)]
*  saying that there's been news circulating that Saudi Arabia [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2878.7400000000002s)]
*  could be involved in the negotiations of the New Deal. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2881.6200000000003s)]
*  Do you think that this would be helpful? [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2884.6200000000003s)]
*  Is that for me, Maha? [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2889.26s)]
*  Yes, that's for you, Alex. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2890.6600000000003s)]
*  No, I think the Iranians... [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2892.26s)]
*  And also for Alex and Laura, they'd like to... [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2894.46s)]
*  So George and Laura, they'd like to also respond to that. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2896.46s)]
*  I'm of the belief every opportunity for regional dialogue in the region has to be grasped. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2899.6600000000003s)]
*  And I can't think of any two of the more important regional actors [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2905.6600000000003s)]
*  that don't have a conversation right now that should have, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2909.26s)]
*  and that's Iran and Saudi Arabia. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2911.6600000000003s)]
*  Whatever context you can bring, Riyadh and Tehran to talk, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2913.0600000000004s)]
*  that's good news for the region. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2915.86s)]
*  That's also good news for US interest in the long term, I believe. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2917.26s)]
*  Okay. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2920.26s)]
*  Laura, would you like to take any of these questions [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2921.6600000000003s)]
*  or say anything about non-Persian... [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2925.26s)]
*  No, okay. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2927.86s)]
*  No, I'm happy to take more questions. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2929.26s)]
*  I think Alex has summed up the importance of Saudi Arabia engaging as well. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2931.26s)]
*  Maha, can I pick up on something that Alex said? [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2937.6600000000003s)]
*  I think he said a lot of things that are important and vital, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2941.6600000000003s)]
*  including the question about Iran's recognizing Israel's existence, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2946.86s)]
*  which I think is vital. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2951.46s)]
*  But if you take the wish list that Israel has had and that others have [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2954.0600000000004s)]
*  and that the kind of extreme right in the US has about all the issues [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2960.6600000000003s)]
*  that Iran should put on the table and that the Emiratis and the Saudis do [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2965.46s)]
*  about missiles and everything else, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2970.46s)]
*  I mean, obviously Iranian moves, if you ever have that discussion, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2972.26s)]
*  is to say, all right, are Israeli missiles on the table? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2976.26s)]
*  Is anything that you're going to ask us to do going to be asked of Israel? [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2981.66s)]
*  It's in the region. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2986.46s)]
*  All right. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2987.86s)]
*  You want to talk about nuclear weapons? [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2989.06s)]
*  Well, the only country that has them is over there. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2990.86s)]
*  So is Israel putting its nuclear weapons on the discussion agenda? [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=2995.46s)]
*  The answer is going to be no. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3001.2599999999998s)]
*  Now, Iran could have a field day and diplomats as talented as Zarif [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3003.7599999999998s)]
*  and Abbas al-Rakchi and others would have a field day on that, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3009.66s)]
*  except they haven't recognized Israel's right to exist. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3014.7599999999998s)]
*  And in a sense, I think that's the trap Iran is in, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3017.3599999999997s)]
*  which is that it gives Israel the defense against the demands [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3021.16s)]
*  that Iran could make about these discussions. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3027.96s)]
*  And by the way, if Iran makes those demands about Israeli missiles, [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3031.16s)]
*  Israeli nuclear weapons, it puts Saudi Arabia and the UAE [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3035.56s)]
*  in a very difficult position because they've been cozying up to Israel, [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3039.46s)]
*  improving relations and everything else. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3044.26s)]
*  And so now all of a sudden, are they kind of on the side of the Israelis [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3046.16s)]
*  and saying, no, no, we're just talking about your missiles, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3050.96s)]
*  not the Israeli ones, or which way do they go? [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3053.56s)]
*  So there's a lot of room. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3056.3599999999997s)]
*  And so, you know, for some of these countries, I'd be a little careful [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3059.46s)]
*  of what you wish for because if the Iranians were ever able to make that leap, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3062.2599999999998s)]
*  they could have a real good go of it. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3070.56s)]
*  Now, I think Alex is probably right. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3072.96s)]
*  They're incapable of making that recognition of Israel. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3076.06s)]
*  And so then they trap themselves in this box. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3079.96s)]
*  Well, I think, I mean, you just pointed out, George, that we are moving [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3085.56s)]
*  to a new security architecture in this region. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3090.16s)]
*  The rapprochement between the UAE, Bahrain, and possibly other countries, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3093.96s)]
*  Oman, other countries, whether formal or informal, and Israel are changing [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3099.76s)]
*  the whole setup. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3105.96s)]
*  This is also happening with the... [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3107.6600000000003s)]
*  in a kind of post-Americana, or at least up to now, and it was not limited [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3111.96s)]
*  to the Trump administration, but also went back to President Obama, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3117.1600000000003s)]
*  the kind of turning the pivot away from the region to Asia and to others. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3121.86s)]
*  So I think this is fundamentally shifting the regional landscape in a way that is yet... [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3127.2599999999998s)]
*  it's one more moving piece, and it's harder to predict where things could go [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3134.7599999999998s)]
*  in this particular direction. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3140.46s)]
*  It's adding one more complication into the pot. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3142.56s)]
*  There's a question to you, George, before we start wrapping up, we have a few more minutes left. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3146.3599999999997s)]
*  There's a question to you, George, from the audience, also from Bashar Bashar, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3150.3599999999997s)]
*  should any nuclear deal be inclusive? [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3154.76s)]
*  I mean, you've already addressed some of this, other security issues, or should non-nuclear issues [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3157.46s)]
*  be left to the region? [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3163.0600000000004s)]
*  I.e. Iran's regional behavior, should this be left to the region without the involvement [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3165.46s)]
*  of Europe and the US and others? [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3170.6600000000003s)]
*  I think that's a question. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3173.0600000000004s)]
*  Sorry, which is difficult given that also China and Russia are involved in the region as well. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3175.76s)]
*  I wouldn't use the word, you know, should Bashar, the question is could. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3180.56s)]
*  In other words, there are a lot of things that, you know, you, Bashar and Alex and Laura and Maha [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3186.46s)]
*  and others would say, you know, it would be best if we could do X or we should try to do X. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3192.66s)]
*  And what we find is, you know, these things are super hard to negotiate. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3199.86s)]
*  And so the JCPOA was imperfect. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3204.86s)]
*  And the Israeli criticisms of it and I can make criticisms, Laura can make criticisms of it. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3208.66s)]
*  Those criticisms are valid. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3214.56s)]
*  It's just that was the best deal that you could negotiate. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3216.46s)]
*  And so I think similarly to Bashar's question is, you know, should the others be brought in? [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3220.26s)]
*  Well, you know, it's going to be hard enough to do as it is. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3225.46s)]
*  And so again, I would go back to the point that we've been making, which is let's get back in the JCPOA, [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3229.06s)]
*  establish that baseline that would reverse a negative trend for the last number of years [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3236.56s)]
*  and then figure out what could be built on top of that incrementally. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3243.26s)]
*  And to the extent that some of that building can be done with regional players. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3248.86s)]
*  Great. That would be the optimal thing to do. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3253.36s)]
*  We should try for it. If you can't do it. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3257.36s)]
*  All right. You tried. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3260.1600000000003s)]
*  And I think Laura brought it, you know, China is going to be important. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3261.6600000000003s)]
*  Russia is going to be important. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3264.76s)]
*  Russia is super important in Syria. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3266.06s)]
*  Russia is important in supplying weapons to the UAE. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3267.86s)]
*  Russia is, you know, important in all of us. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3271.2599999999998s)]
*  So is China. So at some point, you know, as guarantors or playing other roles, [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3273.46s)]
*  yes, they should be probably brought into some of this stuff. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3279.86s)]
*  But we have to recognize where we are, which is in such a bad place where there's so little diplomacy going on [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3283.2599999999998s)]
*  that you kind of get out from that, you know, doing what's doable and try to build on it. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3290.86s)]
*  In my opinion, I mean. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3297.86s)]
*  Laura, any comment on that? [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3301.06s)]
*  I agree. I think we were and I will concede, even though I'm a big proponent of the JCPOA, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3305.26s)]
*  there are things that, you know, I wish might have turned out a little bit differently, [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3312.06s)]
*  but I think they did the best they could. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3315.56s)]
*  More importantly, we were in a better place vis-à-vis Iran's nuclear program with the JCPOA fully in place [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3318.3599999999997s)]
*  than we are today. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3327.66s)]
*  And then we were back in 2013 before they sat down to negotiate this. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3329.3599999999997s)]
*  So I would very much like to see a revival, a really a genesis of the JCPOA and then try to move forward. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3335.56s)]
*  But I think it's going to be very difficult to convince the Iranians to sit down to an agenda that goes much beyond the JCPOA [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3347.56s)]
*  unless and until it has some trust built behind it in what the U.S. is prepared to do in terms of lifting sanctions, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3358.06s)]
*  in terms of really having open dialogue with the Iranians. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3367.56s)]
*  There is no good alternative to that. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3373.06s)]
*  Basically, we're talking about at least beginning with some sort of a freeze for freeze and then moving from there. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3376.96s)]
*  Kind of. Alex, any last comments on the conversation so far or where you see things going? [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3383.46s)]
*  I'll be very quick. Time is up. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3392.26s)]
*  I just want to say we all saw that, you know, JCPOA was possible once the political will was there. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3394.06s)]
*  It happened very rapidly, you know, within weeks of Rouhani becoming president. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3401.16s)]
*  But what Rouhani probably already knew quietly was that the Supreme Leader had made the decision before he was elected president. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3406.16s)]
*  So in other words, some of these events that are coming up could be moments to provide context, I should say. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3412.06s)]
*  So people's political pride will not be hurt or undermined and yet they can make some big shifts in policies going forward. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3420.26s)]
*  That's my hope. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3428.06s)]
*  But final point, Maha, what is clear to anybody who watched the last five years is JCPOA alone wasn't going to bring Iran back from the cold. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3429.36s)]
*  And I think that is now recognized in Tehran, which, you know, we can talk as much as we want about maximum pressure campaign [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3439.36s)]
*  and what other countries in the region are doing. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3447.36s)]
*  I agree with Laura at George. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3449.56s)]
*  Iran is not the only country that's pursuing an agenda. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3451.16s)]
*  Other countries are as well. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3453.36s)]
*  So it requires that bigger conversation. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3454.7599999999998s)]
*  But for whatever it's worth, the Iranian regime, the Islamic Republic, has since 1979 managed spectacularly to unite the region against itself in so many ways. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3458.2599999999998s)]
*  That is its problem. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3468.06s)]
*  That's not Washington's problem. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3469.7599999999998s)]
*  So I'll just end there. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3471.2599999999998s)]
*  I remember, Masha, if I may just real quickly, a few years ago in the NPT Review Conference where when it came down to defending Iran, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3473.66s)]
*  and, you know, as part of the G77 and throwing it under the bus because they could get Israel named in the decision, there was no question. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3483.56s)]
*  The GCC, the Arab groups just went right ahead and threw Iran under the bus. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3492.76s)]
*  So it'll be interesting to see how that dynamic develops given the last year of diplomacy that happened between the U.S. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3497.26s)]
*  and some of the GCC countries. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3506.66s)]
*  I think it's only going to become more acrimonious at this point, at least in the short term, especially with the way tensions are piling up. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3509.26s)]
*  Everybody's ramping up for the negotiations in the region. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3517.46s)]
*  We haven't seen any opening so far, whether it's in, if you look at the regional stages where this confrontation is happening, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3520.86s)]
*  whether it's Iraq, whether it's Syria, whether it's Lebanon, whether it's Yemen, the tensions have been ramping up systematically in every single one country. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3529.26s)]
*  George, let me end with you perhaps the last comment about the status of nonproliferation and whether, you know, deal with Iran. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3537.56s)]
*  You've written a lot about nonproliferation and the potential for it. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3545.96s)]
*  So maybe some last comments on this issue. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3549.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think if Iran appears less and less likely to acquire nuclear weapons, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3551.7599999999998s)]
*  then I don't think you're going to see Saudi Arabia able to make steps to acquire nuclear weapons. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3560.46s)]
*  I don't think you'll see Turkey do that either. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3567.86s)]
*  The UAE won't either, but it's more complicated for them anyway. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3571.26s)]
*  In other words, if Iran is looking positive, then we're not going to have nuclear weapons proliferation in the Middle East. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3575.76s)]
*  And if we don't have nuclear weapons proliferation in the Middle East, then I think in general, [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3587.36s)]
*  the global regime will be much stronger and the world will be a much more secure place. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3591.96s)]
*  I think the opposite is true, too. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3599.0600000000004s)]
*  Then it gets more complicated and we're more likely to have some wars because I don't think if Iran's acquiring nuclear weapons, [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3601.0600000000004s)]
*  Saudi Arabia is going to get them without explosions or, you know, Turkey would get them without big confrontations and sanctions and so forth. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3607.26s)]
*  So I think the region would become much more dangerous if Iran moves forward. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3616.56s)]
*  Well, on this happy note, I sincerely want to thank you, George, Laura and Alex, for a very enlightening conversation. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3624.46s)]
*  I'm hoping we can continue this conversation both online again, perhaps in a follow-up to this discussion, or offline. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3635.46s)]
*  But please, thank you very much for joining me today and shedding light on this incredibly important issue, please, for this region. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3645.66s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3653.66s)]
*  My pleasure. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Td0IrkAbAg&t=3654.66s)]
