# The Return of Syrian Refugees
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [May 23, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA)
*  Syrian refugees issue in the world is today probably the most catastrophic humanitarian [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=0.0s)]
*  issue since World War II. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=7.08s)]
*  The magnitude is amazing, is tremendous, is frightening. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=9.64s)]
*  We have 11 million displaced people all in all from Syria in a country of 22 million [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=14.94s)]
*  people, meaning half of Syria is uprooted, whereas almost half of these 11 million internally [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=21.64s)]
*  displaced in Syria and half dispersed in neighboring regions, neighboring countries, mainly Lebanon, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=29.7s)]
*  Jordan and Turkey and the rest in Europe and elsewhere. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=38.22s)]
*  So it is really today something that is no more only a humanitarian catastrophe, it's [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=42.72s)]
*  something that is reaching or confining to international security almost and the prospects [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=48.72s)]
*  for return of these people is today further and further and more and more difficult for [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  various reasons that our panelists will probably weigh on. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=65.1s)]
*  Without further ado, I will leave the floor to the author of this amazing report, Maha [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=70.82s)]
*  Yahya. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=77.04s)]
*  Maha is the director of Carnegie Middle East in Beirut and she worked on that with a team [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=78.04s)]
*  in Beirut, a team of young scholars there and as I said with a lot of Syrians involved. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=84.22s)]
*  So she will present the report for something like 10 to 12 minutes and then we have the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=90.42s)]
*  great chance to have two Syrians that are very much involved in this issue that will [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=96.22s)]
*  discuss and comment the report. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=101.42s)]
*  Sana Mustafa who came from New York especially for this event, Sana is the leader of her [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=104.04s)]
*  own consultancy, the Sana Mustafa consultancy and she is also founder and partner of the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  Network for Refugee Voices. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  To her right then we have Ibrahim Lassil, a good friend of us. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=120.44000000000001s)]
*  Ibrahim is today a researcher at the Middle East Institute and he will be soon unfortunately [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  leaving us to go to Harvard in order to pursue a master degree there. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  So without further ado I will give the floor to Maha first for a presentation of this report [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=137.22s)]
*  and then we will go into the discussion. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=143.18s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=145.58s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=153.58s)]
*  Thank you very much, Joe. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=154.58s)]
*  Thank you all for joining us today and thank you, Michel, for organizing this launch here [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=155.58s)]
*  in Washington. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=161.44s)]
*  Before we begin I wanted to start with a quote from a Syrian refugee as to why they left [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=162.82s)]
*  and this is a young man from the town of Darya who is now living in Sa'd Nail in Lebanon. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=171.02s)]
*  What he says is we left the country so we wouldn't kill or get killed. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=178.42s)]
*  We wanted to live like everyone else. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=182.78s)]
*  We did not leave to fight. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=184.98s)]
*  If we wanted to fight we would have stayed and taken on the world. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=187.04s)]
*  But we have women and children. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=191.7s)]
*  We do not want someone to come and rape them. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=193.5s)]
*  We don't want to be insulted or humiliated. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=196.26s)]
*  Syrians are the most humiliated nation in the world. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=199.73999999999998s)]
*  Now this quote and what this young man says stands for much of what we heard over a period [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=203.42s)]
*  of a year, a year and something where we were doing focus group discussions with Syrian refugees [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=208.89999999999998s)]
*  both in Lebanon and in Jordan. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=215.38s)]
*  In trying to understand what prompted them to leave beyond the obvious, it was barrel [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=218.18s)]
*  bombs and actually it came out to be the obvious of the barrel bombs and very insecure conditions [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=224.57999999999998s)]
*  were the main trigger for them leaving, challenging a lot of the kind of narrative that some of [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=229.94s)]
*  them left for economic reasons. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=238.1s)]
*  But I think also what we wanted to also get a sense of is what would make them go back. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=240.74s)]
*  What is it that they need to see in place for them to go back? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=245.42000000000002s)]
*  And this was prompted also by the sense that a lot of the discussion that was going on [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=249.58s)]
*  about Syrian, about the political settlement in Syria was based on a fundamentally to my [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=254.98000000000002s)]
*  mind bizarre assumption which is that people will just pick up their bags and leave the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=262.56s)]
*  moment that any deal is signed no matter what shape that deal looks like. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=267.78s)]
*  So you tell them oh there's now peace in Syria, they will just pack up their bags and leave [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=273.26s)]
*  as if being a refugee is simply about crossing a border. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=278.34s)]
*  So the report that came out or the project actually was really an attempt to amplify, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=282.5s)]
*  to give voice to the people who are most concerned with the political settlement but whose voices [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=288.14s)]
*  were not really being heard in that way. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=293.62s)]
*  I won't go into the methodology of the report and what you did, it was about 38 focus group [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=297.56s)]
*  discussions. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=302.35999999999996s)]
*  You will find all of this in the report itself, in the annex. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=303.35999999999996s)]
*  There are copies available outside. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=307.08s)]
*  However, what was significant for us, and I'll talk a little bit further about this, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=309.4s)]
*  we also tried to get a sense of the refugees who were in Lebanon and Jordan. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=314.12s)]
*  There are about 1.1 million in Lebanon. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=319.96s)]
*  Now it's about 900,000, actually 970,000 I think according to UNHCR who are officially [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  registered and the government says there are another half million who are not registered. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=328.84s)]
*  In Jordan it's the same story, about 670,000 if I'm not mistaken who are registered and [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=333.0s)]
*  then there's another half a million or so who are not registered. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=338.79999999999995s)]
*  We tried to get a sense of where they came from. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=342.52s)]
*  Again in an attempt to understand what would trigger their return and to see what are the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  connections between their areas of origin, the reasons for leaving and what would make [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=351.8s)]
*  them then go back. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=357.52s)]
*  And one thing that was interesting is we found that in Jordan close to 42% of the refugees [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=359.56s)]
*  come from Deraa which is almost right across the border. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=366.56s)]
*  Another 14% come from Homs. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=370.48s)]
*  Whereas in Lebanon almost 42% or 42% come from Aleppo and from Homs. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=373.03999999999996s)]
*  The two governors that were most affected by the conflict. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=380.2s)]
*  Now this has significant implications as you will see shortly and whether people will return [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=385.52s)]
*  or not. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=390.84s)]
*  Just to say at this point that the conditions in which refugees are living in Lebanon and [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=393.12s)]
*  in Jordan are far less from ideal. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=397.56s)]
*  They're living in incredibly difficult situation. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=401.48s)]
*  I won't go into the detail but into many details. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=405.28s)]
*  There's much of that in the report. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=408.84s)]
*  But they lack education. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=411.2s)]
*  They lack access to healthcare. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=413.28s)]
*  Most of all they lack access to, especially in Lebanon, they lack access to residency [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=415.4s)]
*  permits and to justice. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=420.88s)]
*  Which places them in a very vulnerable situation, particularly in Lebanon because they don't, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=423.56s)]
*  many of them don't have residency permits. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=427.88s)]
*  So they're very vulnerable to exploitation whether it's human trafficking, whether it [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=430.2s)]
*  is working and not being paid, whether it is being kicked out of their homes arbitrarily, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=435.08s)]
*  homes that they are renting. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=443.96s)]
*  So there are many scenarios and they have very little access to the judicial system [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=445.4s)]
*  in a systematic and important way. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=449.8s)]
*  Now when we spoke to refugees about given their dire conditions and the significance [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=453.32s)]
*  of this will also I'll point to in a second. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=459.56s)]
*  But given these dire conditions we thought this would also have an impact on people [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=462.84s)]
*  wanting to go back. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=467.8s)]
*  Let me say the bottom line or the kind of top line finding that we had is that people [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=469.56s)]
*  are desperate to go back. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=474.24s)]
*  Not just because they're living in miserable conditions in Lebanon and in Jordan but because [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=476.03999999999996s)]
*  they want to go home. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=480.2s)]
*  They just want to go home. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=481.56s)]
*  When you talk to them they talk they have a very nostalgic narrative about the Syria [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=483.36s)]
*  that was there before the war. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=488.68s)]
*  It's a depoliticized Syria and they really just want to go home and live in their dignity. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=490.6s)]
*  However they also realize that that is impossible because their number one demand, their number [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=496.44s)]
*  one need, it's not even a demand, it's a need to go back is safety and security. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=502.44s)]
*  However safety and security is tightly connected and intimately connected to a governance, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=508.6s)]
*  to whatever governance model is put in place in Syria and in their minds to a political [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=514.36s)]
*  transition. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=519.72s)]
*  They do not believe that it is possible for them to have any kind of safety or security [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=520.9200000000001s)]
*  under the current regime and in the current context of Syria. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=526.28s)]
*  The question we were always asked is who will guarantee that if my child goes to school [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=531.64s)]
*  they will be able to come back. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=536.28s)]
*  They're very worried about the militias, they're very worried about warlords and that they [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=538.08s)]
*  see no prospect for them being able to go back. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=542.32s)]
*  The other issue is, and this actually also, this kind of demand and this link challenges [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=547.36s)]
*  a narrative that we've been hearing very often in the last few months especially or maybe [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=553.2s)]
*  year which talks about, oh Assad is winning and therefore things will stabilize soon in [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=558.24s)]
*  Syria and people can't go back. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=564.12s)]
*  Unfortunately Assad is winning means continuation of instability in Syria. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=566.64s)]
*  It means Syria will continue and I don't, I mean we can get into the, you know, whether [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=571.6s)]
*  he's winning or not. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=576.3199999999999s)]
*  He's regaining control for sure but that's a very far cry from saying Assad is winning. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=578.72s)]
*  The idea is that the perpetuation of the current regime in the way it is right now means that [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=586.92s)]
*  Syria will continue to be an epicenter of instability for a very long time and refugees [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=593.12s)]
*  recognize this. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=599.28s)]
*  They recognize that they will not have any kind of stable lives. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=600.48s)]
*  The other I think key and important issue and when we ask them further saying, okay, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=605.12s)]
*  if jobs were available, if there was access to services, would you go home? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=610.2s)]
*  But there is no change in the governance model, there's no political transition and again [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=619.9200000000001s)]
*  the answer was repeatedly no. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=625.28s)]
*  They were, it was overwhelming in many ways. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=628.12s)]
*  We are willing to rebuild our homes with our own hands but we need to have safety and security [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=631.96s)]
*  and that safety and security cannot be guaranteed in the current conditions. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=637.08s)]
*  Syrian refugees have lost hope in the international community. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=641.72s)]
*  They feel they've been let down by the international community. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=646.2s)]
*  They've lost hope in their own representatives. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=649.24s)]
*  They don't believe that anyone represents them today. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=651.52s)]
*  When we asked them about this and there were very clear answers about who represents you [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=654.08s)]
*  on the political arena today and if they mention anyone, they would mention the Free [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=657.72s)]
*  Syrian Army as something that was there at some point that they could relate to and this [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=662.48s)]
*  also again challenges the narrative that somehow the entire uprising in Syria is an Islamist [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=667.64s)]
*  uprising and should Assad go away, what you're going to have come back is a different form [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=673.76s)]
*  of ISIS or some sort of Islamist extremists. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=680.6s)]
*  For the refugees, this is not what they look for, what they aspire for, what they think [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=685.64s)]
*  about. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=691.08s)]
*  They also talked a lot about justice and the need for justice mechanisms. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=695.8s)]
*  The words transitional justice didn't mean much to a lot of them but when you talk a [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=700.96s)]
*  little bit, I mean there was some in some of the focus group discussions that had actually [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=704.92s)]
*  taken some, had been part of some training workshops on transitional justice and once [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=709.4399999999999s)]
*  they explained to their people who were in the focus groups with them what that meant, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=714.68s)]
*  everyone was like yes, this is what actually we need. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=718.92s)]
*  And here there was a lot of debate actually about questions of justice and amnesty. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=722.28s)]
*  To the minds of many Syrians, the idea of amnesty is very much associated with presidential [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=727.4s)]
*  pardons which they, for the majority of refugees who are anti-regime, they completely rejected [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=731.68s)]
*  any kind of presidential pardons because they don't trust it. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=738.68s)]
*  Many of them also got into a discussion of at what level. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=743.2s)]
*  They recognized that they cannot have complete justice but for them you cannot have a sound, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=747.0s)]
*  stable Syria if there is no accountability for the major human rights crimes that were [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=753.24s)]
*  committed. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=760.24s)]
*  So the idea that they can go back and what they were most concerned about is that if [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=762.1600000000001s)]
*  they go back to an environment like this one, then there would be kind of a law of the jungle [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=767.0400000000001s)]
*  because people are going to take justice into their own hands and that there would [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=773.12s)]
*  be revenge killings and so on and so forth. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=776.48s)]
*  So in this kind of condition, what is it that Syrian refugees want? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=780.32s)]
*  What is it that they're aspiring to? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=785.04s)]
*  It can be maybe encapsulated in kind of five broad headlines and these are, we can talk [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=789.62s)]
*  a bit more about the headlines if you want in the Q&A but they're also elaborated on. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=796.62s)]
*  One is a free Syria. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=801.28s)]
*  They talked a lot when we asked them about the Syria they think about and they dream [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=803.3199999999999s)]
*  of. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=806.8s)]
*  They talked about freedom. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=807.8s)]
*  They used a lot of the liberal values that we all use. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=808.88s)]
*  They wanted to be free to express themselves the way they want, to choose who governs them, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=811.76s)]
*  to be able to move around Syria as they wish without checkpoints and so on and so forth. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=819.86s)]
*  They talked about the territorially united Syria. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=827.52s)]
*  We asked them point blank questions about whether, what kind of, what do they think [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=830.48s)]
*  of federalism? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=837.48s)]
*  What do they think of decentralization? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=838.48s)]
*  What do they think of safe zones? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=840.6400000000001s)]
*  And the response on safe zones was always safe today, not so safe tomorrow. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=842.72s)]
*  They recognized that what is safe today, you know. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=847.0s)]
*  Federalism they completely rejected it because, and de-escalation zones at the same way because [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=851.0400000000001s)]
*  they felt that this was a prelude to the disintegration of Syria, that Syria will no longer be one [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=855.1999999999999s)]
*  unified country. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=861.56s)]
*  Decentralization when we spoke a little bit more about what decentralization effectively [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=864.1999999999999s)]
*  meant, that they found quite appealing. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=868.1999999999999s)]
*  The idea of being able to elect who they would like to see, the idea that they would have [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=871.28s)]
*  a voice in defining and identifying their own needs was something that was attractive [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=877.48s)]
*  to them. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=881.8s)]
*  They also talked about an inclusive Syria. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=882.9599999999999s)]
*  And when we asked about what does inclusion mean, it was about power sharing, but it wasn't [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=885.4399999999999s)]
*  about power sharing as per ethnic and sectarian identity. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=890.3199999999999s)]
*  It was about political power sharing. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=894.0s)]
*  And then the minds of many Syrian refugees that we met, the conflict continues to be [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=896.7199999999999s)]
*  one of a political conflict. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=903.0s)]
*  It's not a sectarian conflict. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=905.1999999999999s)]
*  There are sectarian overtones to it. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=906.7199999999999s)]
*  Many of them recognize it. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=908.64s)]
*  As the young men, they're very angry. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=911.24s)]
*  And that's actually one issue I didn't mention, which is for young men, the idea of return [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=912.9599999999999s)]
*  is very much connected also to the vetting mechanisms that are in place and the conscription [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=917.3199999999999s)]
*  law. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=922.7199999999999s)]
*  The conscription law today, as it was revamped by the or changed by the regime, all men between [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=923.7199999999999s)]
*  the ages of 18 and 42 have to take part, I mean, they have to basically fight. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=931.3199999999999s)]
*  Many of the young men said, we don't want to take fight in a conflict that has nothing [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=938.4399999999999s)]
*  to do with us. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=942.8s)]
*  We have tremendous respect for the army as an institution, but why should I go and be [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=943.92s)]
*  placed at the front line as a Sunni with the Allah we hiding behind me? [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=950.16s)]
*  So there is a sectarian narrative to the conflict that is emerging more and more, particularly [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=954.64s)]
*  amongst young men who feel they're just going to be thrown to the dogs, as they say. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=959.92s)]
*  The other thing they talked about was a representative Syria. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=966.28s)]
*  They wanted a Syria that represented them, that represented the diversity, the diverse [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=970.1999999999999s)]
*  social makeup of Syria, but also recognizes what the country has gone through. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=974.36s)]
*  And finally, they talked a lot about a just Syria. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=978.88s)]
*  And when we pushed a little bit further about what is a just Syria in their minds, often [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=981.68s)]
*  the example they would use was Europe, the sense of rule of law, accountability, that [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=986.8s)]
*  people would be held accountable for the crimes they've committed and the things that [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=993.28s)]
*  they have done. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1000.72s)]
*  To kind of unfortunately, I forgot to put the quotes from them, but I'll find that maybe [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1003.64s)]
*  I'll use some of them in the Q&A. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1008.24s)]
*  But just to kind of wrap up a little bit, what were our recommendations in this study? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1010.1999999999999s)]
*  The first recommendation was there has to be a refugee-centered framework for the political [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1018.84s)]
*  settlements. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1024.36s)]
*  So this is not blue sky thinking. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1025.8s)]
*  We truly believe, and it's important to kind of bring this back and put it on the table, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1027.84s)]
*  that without a refugee-centered framework that acknowledges the political roots of the [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1033.24s)]
*  refugee crisis, people didn't flee because there was an earthquake. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1037.44s)]
*  There's a political and a security reasons for why they fled. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1040.36s)]
*  Two, that refugee-centered framework has to make justice the centerpiece of any peace [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1044.6399999999999s)]
*  settlement. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1049.96s)]
*  Otherwise, Syria will continue to be an epicenter for instability. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1050.56s)]
*  And finally, uphold the right of refugees to return home. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1055.1599999999999s)]
*  And what we mean here is not simply that they can go back to Syria, but that they can actually [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1058.6399999999999s)]
*  go back to their homes of origin. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1063.12s)]
*  But what that also means is that we need to address a lot of the legislative changes that [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1065.44s)]
*  are happening in Syria today. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1070.36s)]
*  This includes the latest round of urban planning laws, including law number 10, which is basically [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1072.32s)]
*  creating new facts on the ground. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1080.04s)]
*  And again, we can talk a bit more about this. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1081.6s)]
*  But urban planning today and reconstruction are being used as tools to strip Syrians and [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1083.6799999999998s)]
*  dispossess Syrians of their properties where possible and prevent them from going back. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1090.9199999999998s)]
*  It also includes vetting mechanisms. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1096.96s)]
*  It also includes construction laws. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1099.04s)]
*  The other part of the right of return for refugees is that there has to be much more [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1101.32s)]
*  concerted effort by the international community to work with host countries such as Lebanon, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1108.3999999999999s)]
*  Jordan, and Turkey that have done a tremendous job at absorbing large numbers of population. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1113.76s)]
*  But however, where there is an increasing pressure now to force people to go back home. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1119.76s)]
*  So this idea of a voluntary return loses completely its meaning if you're making it [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1125.24s)]
*  impossible for people to continue to live in a dignified way on your home territory. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1130.28s)]
*  I think I will just the other perhaps significant issue is that given that there's a lot of [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1137.6s)]
*  discussion about reconstruction and stabilization, that's kind of the fourth headline. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1144.48s)]
*  We need to ensure that reconstruction does not empower the regime. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1149.36s)]
*  The way a lot of the humanitarian work that has been money that has come into Syria has [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1153.36s)]
*  actually gone through the regime and through the regime. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1159.44s)]
*  It's gone. It's been used through local proxies that all of which are vetted by the regime [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1163.3600000000001s)]
*  and are affiliated in one way or the other with the regime. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1169.92s)]
*  The idea of a centrally planned reconstruction or a Marshall Plan for Syria is will not happen, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1173.1200000000001s)]
*  not in the current conditions. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1180.16s)]
*  So I think we need to look at other models, but definitely not to make sure that whatever [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1182.68s)]
*  reconstruction or stabilization that's going to happen will not empower the regime and [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1190.5600000000002s)]
*  actually allow it to reap the dividends of having destroyed the country in the first place. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1195.3600000000001s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1200.16s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mahal. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1206.64s)]
*  It was very exhaustive and I think it gave a trend of justice to this to this very dense [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1208.2800000000002s)]
*  report, which when I read it struck me with the huge amount of accurate figures that we [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1214.3200000000002s)]
*  were all of us looking for. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1221.16s)]
*  And so you made I think you gave you gave the good the good summary of this work. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1223.64s)]
*  Now, I wouldn't know it's here. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1231.16s)]
*  So I will pass the floor now if you allow him to Sanna first and then to you for five, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1238.44s)]
*  six minutes of comments and maybe criticism of this report and to tell us what you have [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1243.6000000000001s)]
*  also from your perspective to add to it. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1250.64s)]
*  Go ahead, Sanna. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1253.4s)]
*  You first. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1255.56s)]
*  I'll start. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1256.08s)]
*  Well, thank you, Michelle and Carnegie for having us. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1258.12s)]
*  And thank you, Mahal, for your work and making sure that these voices are inclusive and [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1260.92s)]
*  heard and they are part of this conversation and listen to. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1266.0s)]
*  I work mainly on refugee centered issues. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1270.32s)]
*  I'm Syrian. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1274.48s)]
*  I'm a refugee here in the US. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1275.12s)]
*  And I was actually I seek asylum in D.C. very much here. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1276.96s)]
*  Then I left to New York. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1281.56s)]
*  And now I work on making sure that I work on two fronts on the policy side of immigration. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1283.04s)]
*  I work on making sure that immigration and global refugee policies are shaped by refugees. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1289.48s)]
*  And on a more developmental front, I work with multistakeholders on designing engagement [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1295.88s)]
*  projects on refugees, that they are inclusive of refugees, meaning the refugees are part [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1301.68s)]
*  of the planning, design, design thinking, decision making and implementation and executing [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1307.16s)]
*  of these projects. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1312.88s)]
*  When I was reading back to Mahal's report, I would say when I was reading the report, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1315.72s)]
*  which something he and I talked about, I think I find myself I could relate a lot to a lot [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1320.8400000000001s)]
*  of the things that you had mentioned and about the reasons for the obstacles and towards [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1328.48s)]
*  us to go back to Syria. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1335.12s)]
*  And I definitely think which globally refugee. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1336.9199999999998s)]
*  And when I say refugee, I mean those people who flee political political circumstances [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1340.6s)]
*  and war and not necessarily environmental and development refugees. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1346.96s)]
*  So I definitely think what we see the current refugee crisis is an outcome of a political [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1350.1599999999999s)]
*  failure, not a humanitarian one. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1355.36s)]
*  And all the humanitarian efforts that we see right now are just mechanisms, coping mechanisms [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1357.72s)]
*  to deal with what we have. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1362.84s)]
*  But the root cause and the solution really the solution really resides in the root cause, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1364.28s)]
*  which is the political situation. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1370.0s)]
*  So specifically in regard to Syria, I mean, being completely against the Assad regime [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1372.48s)]
*  and having, you know, having fled because of that, I think my own return is tied very [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1378.28s)]
*  much to the presence of the Assad regime and and the political situation in Syria. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1385.08s)]
*  So long story short, I definitely agree with everything you said. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1391.24s)]
*  However, I would like to emphasize about and seeking any political solution for Syria. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1394.64s)]
*  What how refugees are going to be part of this, how Syrian refugees are going to be [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1401.2s)]
*  part of this. I think this is a very important question because as in your findings, Syrian [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1405.1200000000001s)]
*  refugees didn't find that the current opposition represents them. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1411.4s)]
*  And I agree with that. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1415.92s)]
*  And so the question is, how how could we be part of the framing a political solution for [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1418.48s)]
*  Syria? And that requires, of course, refugees having the right to to be active and to [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1425.4s)]
*  participate, whether on a political level or civil society level in their host countries, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1431.16s)]
*  which I think there are a lot of obstacles towards this, especially in neighboring [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1436.68s)]
*  countries such as Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, where refugees are not even recognized as [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1440.72s)]
*  refugees except by UNHCR. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1446.2s)]
*  So, for example, in Turkey, Syrians are their their legal status is guessed that their [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1448.3600000000001s)]
*  legal status. And and of course, these three countries have their own economic, mainly [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1454.76s)]
*  political also crises and unnecessarily a place where people could express could express [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1460.24s)]
*  their opinions and fleeing exactly that fear to a host country where you cannot also be [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1467.24s)]
*  active politically and participate. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1472.72s)]
*  I think this is something to look at. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1474.88s)]
*  And the other thing we we are Syrians are unable to to vote, for example, from our host [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1477.48s)]
*  countries to actually participate in any electoral process. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1484.1200000000001s)]
*  These that might happen. I wonder how would that look like if actually would happen, then [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1487.92s)]
*  actually refugees could shape a political solution for them to go back to Syria. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1492.0s)]
*  The other thing I would mention is funding. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1497.2s)]
*  There's donor fatigue, as we all know, and there is really not much attention anymore [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1500.04s)]
*  towards Syria politically. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1504.8799999999999s)]
*  It's not on the agenda of the White House. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1506.84s)]
*  And it's really I can't believe how the White House doesn't feel like it's a solution to [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1508.72s)]
*  Iran issues. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1512.28s)]
*  But Syria has lost attention in the media and globally. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1514.08s)]
*  And so the refugee crisis, so Syrian refugees particularly. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1518.6399999999999s)]
*  And the question is, if no one empowers us and no one gives us the information, then [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1522.68s)]
*  the platform and resources to actually maybe organize ourselves now for the future of Syria, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1529.92s)]
*  then then what's next? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1535.92s)]
*  Then how are we going to be part of the solution? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1537.56s)]
*  My last point, I think on the report, I definitely, as I said, found it very relevant. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1540.6000000000001s)]
*  However, I would say having as I know, Turkey, the refugee population in Turkey very well. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1547.44s)]
*  And it's a place where my mom is a refugee there. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1554.72s)]
*  And I had spent a lot of time there and talked with people. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1556.76s)]
*  I think maybe the findings would be a little bit different if we deal with the demographics, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1560.48s)]
*  the Syrian population that's in Turkey, which is a little bit different as they come mainly [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1565.28s)]
*  from the north, north of Syria, where we see we see a lot of people returning. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1569.44s)]
*  There's thousands have returned. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1575.16s)]
*  And but not necessarily to regime controlled areas, but to Idlib and to other places. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1576.96s)]
*  Yeah, I returned to their homes to Aleppo. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1583.6s)]
*  And these are people not necessarily they might be against the regime silently, but they [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1586.84s)]
*  are not necessarily active against the regime. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1592.3999999999999s)]
*  So once once they are able to come back to their destroyed homes, they came back and [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1594.52s)]
*  didn't necessarily wait for a hundred percent safe and secure environment. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1600.4799999999998s)]
*  So I would say like maybe that we have to not necessarily generalize. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1605.8799999999999s)]
*  And Turkey will be probably a little bit different than Jordan and Lebanon. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1612.32s)]
*  I'll leave it there. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1617.28s)]
*  Yes, in fact, this is before giving the floor to Brahim. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1618.36s)]
*  This is this was one of my questions to take note because you will have to probably answer [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1621.8799999999999s)]
*  all of us. Yes. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1628.2s)]
*  I mean, why? I was wondering why reading the report, why Turkey was not included? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1630.4s)]
*  I know that it's a question also of feasibility, I mean, of pure technical feasibility of [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1634.76s)]
*  the research, but it would have been interesting to to cross it, especially that Turkey is [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1640.52s)]
*  probably the only place where Syrian refugees have relatively more freedom of maneuver, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1645.68s)]
*  of action, of living, of acting, etc. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1652.1200000000001s)]
*  Than than, unfortunately, other Arab countries that are supposed to be more in solidarity [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1655.2s)]
*  with Syrian refugees. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1661.4s)]
*  So let's keep this in mind. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1662.44s)]
*  Brahim, please. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1664.68s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1666.28s)]
*  Five minutes also. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1666.6s)]
*  Sure. Thanks, Joe and Michelle for having us. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1667.52s)]
*  And thanks for the great reports and the great presentation. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1671.2s)]
*  It was difficult to restrain myself from tweeting every sentence you say, but they had me to [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1674.4s)]
*  switch my phone off. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1678.96s)]
*  So the report and the findings are really great and I hope everybody of you will really [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1681.44s)]
*  read them. It's basic and simple security and safety. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1687.2s)]
*  Refugees won't be going back if they don't have security and safety. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1691.72s)]
*  When we think about refugees, refugees are people like us, like you and me. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1696.3200000000002s)]
*  So they won't be going back if they feel they won't be safe. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1700.04s)]
*  Will they be safe? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1703.6000000000001s)]
*  We also need to answer that question, that question very basically. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1705.1200000000001s)]
*  Syria won't be stable and won't be safe. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1708.72s)]
*  And the refugees know it as we do know it, as everybody does. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1710.92s)]
*  So the refugees won't be going back in a bigger scale. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1714.76s)]
*  They're probably talking about thousands, but we have six millions outside Syria. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1718.8400000000001s)]
*  So I expect probably thousands or even tens of thousands would be going back to two [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1724.0s)]
*  different areas. But I don't think we will we'll see a big number of refugees going [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1728.6s)]
*  back to Syria because simply they are afraid, not afraid not to find a job or for [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1734.8s)]
*  the economic situation, but afraid to be detained and killed. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1740.8s)]
*  And the first indicator to prove this point of view is that the regime didn't release [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1744.56s)]
*  any of the detainees. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1749.28s)]
*  And the detainees issue is very important in the Syrian issue. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1750.64s)]
*  And when you talk about Syrians, but usually it's overlooked. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1754.68s)]
*  The detainees is an important part of of why the uprisings happened. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1757.8400000000001s)]
*  It was an important part of why many people joined, because they had people who were [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1763.3200000000002s)]
*  detained, friends and relatives. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1767.72s)]
*  And it's still a big part of people why they're not going back, because poverty is one [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1769.68s)]
*  thing and torture is something else. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1773.96s)]
*  And if you talk to any Syrian about why they don't like the regime, they will always [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1776.28s)]
*  mention detention and torture. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1781.6000000000001s)]
*  It's very, very important. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1784.28s)]
*  So if you don't see the regime changing that behavior, and I don't expect the regime [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1785.92s)]
*  will change that behavior and release any of the detainees, people won't be going back [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1790.08s)]
*  because they are afraid that they will be detained, tortured and killed. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1794.52s)]
*  So another reason why the refugees want to be going back, because the regime doesn't [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1799.68s)]
*  want them to go back. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1804.48s)]
*  Also, we have a lot of recent indicators, even if we don't want to to look back, even [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1806.64s)]
*  not two or three years back. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1812.04s)]
*  Just let's look back a few weeks ago. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1813.3600000000001s)]
*  One indicator how the regime looks at those communities who got defeated around Damascus [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1816.64s)]
*  and the other areas, those who got into the buses that we heard about and they went to [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1823.04s)]
*  the north. You know, there is the highways, the short way to go to the north. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1828.96s)]
*  And then there is the very long way going through all the villages. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1833.28s)]
*  And the regime made sure many of those buses go through those villages and villages. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1837.24s)]
*  They they lost the most in the Syrian army fighting the opposition. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1842.92s)]
*  And why is that? You also need to ask somebody that went through a civil war fighting [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1847.8400000000001s)]
*  somebody you don't see is something and having an eye contact with somebody is something [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1853.32s)]
*  else. You create a vivid memory that you just transfer to your kids and you can [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1858.04s)]
*  and after them when you see them. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1863.28s)]
*  And the regime wanted those in the villages and those Sunnis who were displaced to see [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1864.8400000000001s)]
*  each other and to remember each other. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1870.44s)]
*  So you will never have a reconciliation in Syria. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1873.0800000000002s)]
*  So I don't think the regime wanted to have reconciliation. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1876.76s)]
*  And although I said, I know I and Sunni communities, it's not again that simple. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1879.56s)]
*  As Mahsaid sectarianism is a component of the Syrian conflict, but it's not only a [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1883.24s)]
*  sectarian conflict for sure. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1889.96s)]
*  And another indicator is the new laws that the regime is passing about properties, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1892.48s)]
*  confiscating properties of those who fled Syria. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1897.32s)]
*  So even if they want to go back and in case their houses were not destroyed. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1900.4399999999998s)]
*  And I think the report mentioned that something like 25 percent of of places in Syria [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1905.1599999999999s)]
*  were destroyed. 30 percent, 30 percent of them, they don't have places. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1909.6399999999999s)]
*  And even those who still have places, the regime is confiscating them. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1916.76s)]
*  So the regime doesn't want the populations to go back for many reasons, security reasons, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1920.88s)]
*  political ones and also economic ones. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1925.92s)]
*  And also the regime is well known for the collective punishments tactics over the [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1929.44s)]
*  decades. Those communities that they are not loyal to the regime, usually they get [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1934.08s)]
*  punished by marginalizing them. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1938.0s)]
*  And that's why when you look at the map, you see clearly some communities [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1941.0s)]
*  participated in the uprising and others didn't. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1945.16s)]
*  And part of that is because the development plan and the economic plans the regime [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1947.72s)]
*  applied over the years by just focusing on two or three main cities and they [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1954.2s)]
*  marginalizing the country. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1959.16s)]
*  So even if the regime, let's just say the regime wants to rebuild Syria and they have [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1961.3200000000002s)]
*  the money, they will just put the money in the communities that were loyal to them and [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1966.04s)]
*  they didn't participate in the uprising. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1970.6000000000001s)]
*  Because even if they wanted to put it in the areas where they participated in the [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1972.1200000000001s)]
*  uprising, those communities won't allow them. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1976.12s)]
*  Like we fought with you and now you are going to put the money in those areas that we [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1978.1599999999999s)]
*  were against you. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1982.08s)]
*  It's not going to work without reconciliation. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1983.36s)]
*  That's why it's very complicated. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1985.48s)]
*  It's not only about the decision of one or two people. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1987.1599999999999s)]
*  It's very complicated without a real reconciliation and a political settlement. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1991.0s)]
*  There will be no reconstruction. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1996.08s)]
*  And if the regime gets any money, it will absolutely weaponize it as it always does. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=1998.52s)]
*  And there is a video that was circulated a few weeks ago also about one of the [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2004.84s)]
*  member of parliament in Syria holding water, that basic, just water and asking [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2011.12s)]
*  people who are displaced from Ghouta, like, chant Assad is my president, chant [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2016.52s)]
*  long live Assad to give you the water. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2021.48s)]
*  So imagine how they even weaponize water. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2023.84s)]
*  So that won't change. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2026.36s)]
*  We know the regime wouldn't change that. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2027.44s)]
*  But I was thinking when I saw that video and I sometimes hear that people [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2029.48s)]
*  advocating, let's send money to the regime. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2032.68s)]
*  I just imagine that how somebody would advocate to put money to sponsor that video, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2034.96s)]
*  to sponsor somebody holding water and the bread and telling people chant for Assad [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2040.5200000000002s)]
*  to give you this bread and water. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2045.2s)]
*  It's just going to worsen the situation. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2047.48s)]
*  Finally, and I probably spoke too much, just a couple of recommendations. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2050.4s)]
*  What could be done now? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2055.2400000000002s)]
*  The report mentioned that and Sanaa also emphasized on this, that people, usually [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2057.3199999999997s)]
*  many of the refugees, they don't see the position that represent them. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2063.7999999999997s)]
*  And that I absolutely agree. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2066.6s)]
*  But civil society does. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2068.16s)]
*  Many of the communities, they trust the civil society, the other grassroots and [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2069.7599999999998s)]
*  the indigenous player. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2073.08s)]
*  But the funding is being cut, starting from D.C. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2075.72s)]
*  to other countries across the world, especially who will follow suit when they [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2079.08s)]
*  see the U.S. is stopping the fund for the civil society, even groups like White [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2083.72s)]
*  Helmets and other big groups. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2090.6s)]
*  So it's very important to keep the fund for civil society. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2092.68s)]
*  So it represents and it helps the refugees even when they go to areas outside the [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2095.68s)]
*  regime control. And the second point is protection in areas outside the regime [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2100.2799999999997s)]
*  control. We almost still have probably a third of the country outside the regime [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2105.16s)]
*  control. We can people can go back there. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2109.3999999999996s)]
*  If there is a real long term policy to protect them there and help them to [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2112.96s)]
*  rehabilitate those areas. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2118.52s)]
*  One of the very basic ideas like why don't we just build a university in Raqqa? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2121.0s)]
*  I mean, it doesn't cost much when you compare it to any military solution, but it [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2125.4s)]
*  will help people to go back and to create a model for people under the regime control [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2129.52s)]
*  to show them that those areas are doing great. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2134.4s)]
*  And we help Syrians and we build something long term. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2136.92s)]
*  So rehabilitate those those areas would really help to many refugees to go to to [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2139.64s)]
*  those areas outside the regime control. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2145.84s)]
*  So we help Syrians, but we don't help the regime to to to break Syrians more and [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2148.08s)]
*  control them. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2153.72s)]
*  Thank you very much, Ibrahim. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2154.92s)]
*  Interesting idea. I think that we have now a very clear idea of the amazing [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2156.4s)]
*  complexity of issues. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2161.28s)]
*  I mean, it's a mix of purely direct humanitarian things and economic [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2162.64s)]
*  prerequisite of the issue and then the political root of the root cause of the [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2168.6800000000003s)]
*  issue. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2174.96s)]
*  Just one thing you mentioned and I fully agree just to give an idea. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2175.36s)]
*  You mentioned people who never lived a civil war and the difficulty to return [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2179.48s)]
*  and probably the skepticism about treatment. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2183.96s)]
*  Unfortunately, Maha and I lived a civil war in Lebanon. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2186.32s)]
*  And just to give you an idea, I mean, with a much, really much, much smaller [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2190.36s)]
*  scale and numbers and figures, the displaced of the mountains from the war of [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2195.6s)]
*  the mountain, which is really we're talking about maybe two, three hundred [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2202.4s)]
*  thousand people. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2206.6s)]
*  There is a ministry of refugees of displaced in Lebanon since 1992 with a huge [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2207.68s)]
*  budget from the EU, from international donors. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2212.68s)]
*  And until now, we are in 2018, meaning the war has ended something like 25 years [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2216.44s)]
*  ago. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2223.36s)]
*  Less than 30 percent of the displaced of the mountains came back because of a [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2224.6800000000003s)]
*  mixed of reason that we find in the Syrian situation much more amplified. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2230.04s)]
*  Before opening up the floor, I would give Maha really a few minutes to answer some [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2236.1200000000003s)]
*  of the remarks that were that were put forth, the Turkish thing, and then the two [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2242.88s)]
*  or other two or one or two other ideas that were that were advanced by Ibrahim [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2249.12s)]
*  and Sana and then we'll open we'll open the floor. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2255.04s)]
*  Please. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2257.92s)]
*  Thank you, Ibrahim and Sanam. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2259.68s)]
*  On the Turkish issue, frankly, we didn't go into Turkey mainly because of capacity, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2261.7999999999997s)]
*  but also funding. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2267.48s)]
*  The funding was really to do children in Lebanon. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2268.7599999999998s)]
*  That's the reality of our ability to do work, especially because a project like [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2271.3199999999997s)]
*  this is incredibly labor intensive. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2277.04s)]
*  Now, yes, Turkey would be a very different ballgame, partly because of the way Turkey [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2279.64s)]
*  is hosting refugees and the way they're being treated, but also because border [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2286.2799999999997s)]
*  Syria, in a way, I mean, the political complexity is different from that in [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2291.04s)]
*  Lebanon and that in Jordan. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2295.72s)]
*  In Lebanon, it's different ballgame. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2298.92s)]
*  You have Hezbollah involved in Jordan. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2300.52s)]
*  It's a different, again, dynamic along the border. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2303.3199999999997s)]
*  I think people in Turkey or at least those that are people are not being allowed to [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2307.28s)]
*  go and come back. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2311.6400000000003s)]
*  They opened the door in during the last year for people to go back to Turkey, to [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2312.48s)]
*  Syria for a month, allowing them to come back to Turkey should they want to. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2321.1200000000003s)]
*  And of the I think thousands, it was I don't believe it was hundreds of thousands of [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2327.2000000000003s)]
*  thousands that went during a very large portion ended up coming back to Syria. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2332.2s)]
*  The idea of refugees being able to move across and having the guarantees that they [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2338.7599999999998s)]
*  will maintain refugee status should they decide to go and explore the possibility [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2343.96s)]
*  of return, I think is something that is not being discussed enough. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2349.56s)]
*  And it's an important it's an important issue that we should collectively start [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2353.2s)]
*  pushing on. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2357.68s)]
*  International experience shows that when refugees go back home, if the conditions [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2359.2000000000003s)]
*  are not right and some things go sour, they end up leaving permanently. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2365.2000000000003s)]
*  Whereas giving them this facility to be able to go and check on their homes, check [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2371.0s)]
*  on their properties, if they have any, they don't just check conditions on the [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2375.56s)]
*  ground and see whether they they would be comfortable. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2380.1200000000003s)]
*  I think is very important. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2384.2400000000002s)]
*  In the case of Turkey, people have come back, but really in small numbers and most [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2385.84s)]
*  of them from what I mean, everything I've seen and from humanitarian's I've spoken [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2390.08s)]
*  to on the ground. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2396.0s)]
*  Many of those who went back to Jarabulus in particular, which is where there's a [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2397.32s)]
*  big refugee camp of actually returnees, those that ended up going back to Aleppo. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2401.32s)]
*  Some are, you know, they're OK with living, but they're they're quite a small [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2406.92s)]
*  minority. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2411.0s)]
*  So I think even then, it's not so much about them. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2412.3999999999996s)]
*  They're living in a better condition in Turkey, maybe than they are in Jordan or [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2416.2799999999997s)]
*  Lebanon, definitely. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2420.8399999999997s)]
*  And yet still, they're not able to go back because of their concerns about the [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2422.7599999999998s)]
*  security, the military, but simply the ability to go home for them. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2426.96s)]
*  Home is not simply about, again, crossing a border and going back to Syria, but [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2431.64s)]
*  going back to their homes. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2436.12s)]
*  To add to something that. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2437.92s)]
*  You said, which is that it's not just the that homes are being stripped. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2441.96s)]
*  We need to keep in mind that 42 percent of Syrians prior to the war lived in [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2448.32s)]
*  informal settlements, inform human settlements, which means that they had [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2453.2400000000002s)]
*  tenuous housing or tenure to start with. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2458.08s)]
*  Already, we're seeing examples in Damascus where the first property under [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2461.92s)]
*  the big title of reconstruction and development, the first areas that were [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2468.76s)]
*  targeted are the informal settlements of the Satinah, which were at the heart of [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2472.96s)]
*  the uprising when it started, whereas other informal settlements that are [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2477.92s)]
*  pro regime are not being targeted. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2482.56s)]
*  So urban planning laws is not just about this possession in terms of taking [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2484.72s)]
*  people's properties away from them. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2490.24s)]
*  And I have an article outside, so I don't get into the technical details of this in [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2492.2799999999997s)]
*  terms of what this means, because there was a lot of misunderstandings of what [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2496.6s)]
*  the law effectively meant and how it was operating. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2501.4799999999996s)]
*  But it's also about saying we're going to follow only the formal interpretation of [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2504.08s)]
*  tenure, which in a context like Syria becomes even more problematic than other [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2510.0s)]
*  places. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2514.2s)]
*  So, OK, I think we'll. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2515.3999999999996s)]
*  Just the last thing is, I think the idea of Sanadat's refugees need to be part of [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2519.7599999999998s)]
*  this process, the notion that civil society, there is a trust. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2524.44s)]
*  The challenge for civil society in Syria today is how do you turn from. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2529.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's not about humanitarian support. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2533.88s)]
*  We're talking about organizations that are trying to work on the political, not [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2536.3199999999997s)]
*  about providing food and drink, but it's actually how do you turn this into a [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2544.12s)]
*  political platform that can put forward a vision for Syria, one that Syrians will [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2548.92s)]
*  buy into. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2554.76s)]
*  Just one one word before opening the floor on the issue of return and the [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2556.6800000000003s)]
*  housings and et cetera. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2561.04s)]
*  I would add also something very, very interesting, and this is exactly the [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2562.52s)]
*  behavior. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2566.76s)]
*  I mean, the almost the gregarious behavior of the regime, the fact that, for [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2567.48s)]
*  example, it has burned completely destroyed physically the registries of real [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2572.32s)]
*  state. I mean, so you can't prove today that you were owner of a house somewhere [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2578.24s)]
*  or that you are originally from that region and homes. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2583.04s)]
*  Essentially, they burned completely the registers of of civil status. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2586.04s)]
*  So you can't you can't no more prove that you are from homes today if you come [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2590.3999999999996s)]
*  back. So this is a hidden or astute policy of ethnic cleansing in a way. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2594.3199999999997s)]
*  But this is this is another question. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2599.68s)]
*  We have a very huge, very large audience, which is show where we chose the [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2602.0s)]
*  interest that you all have for this issue. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2606.04s)]
*  Unfortunately, this this unfortunate issue, I will ask you to take the floor [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2607.96s)]
*  briefly to identify yourself very quickly to ask a question that ends with a [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2612.2s)]
*  question mark and not not very long. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2617.36s)]
*  If you if you allow, I'll start with Perry. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2621.4s)]
*  I saw first and then we'd go around. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2623.8s)]
*  Mase, can you please give them a mic? [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2626.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2629.48s)]
*  Perry came back here with Carnegie First, Maha. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2632.04s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2633.84s)]
*  This is a really fantastic report. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2634.92s)]
*  Both you and Rahim kind of talked about the need to to to really ensure that [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2636.88s)]
*  reconstruction assistance doesn't redound to the to the regime's benefit. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2643.2000000000003s)]
*  But, of course, everything in Syria is complicated. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2648.48s)]
*  And while the kind of moral and political imperative is clear there, how do you [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2650.76s)]
*  balance that with the kind of countervailing pressure, which is that as a [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2654.84s)]
*  result, you end up with less assistance and the very people that need require [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2659.4s)]
*  the assistance the most also suffer from that that policy as well. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2663.68s)]
*  Yes, let's take a few questions then, gentlemen here. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2671.3199999999997s)]
*  Good afternoon, everyone. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2678.44s)]
*  My name is Amad Bitar. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2679.56s)]
*  I'm also from Syria. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2680.6s)]
*  I arrived five years ago because of the war. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2681.9199999999996s)]
*  First of all, thank you very much for this report. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2684.9199999999996s)]
*  When I'm hearing that, I'm hearing like flashbacks in my head, like remind me of [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2687.3199999999997s)]
*  what the things that I believe for and why I left and why I'm here. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2690.92s)]
*  For me, I'm not afraid of anything. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2695.1600000000003s)]
*  But returning to Syria is not an option because for more reason, because there is [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2696.84s)]
*  a regime there and you might be arrested for no reason and you might disappear for [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2701.1600000000003s)]
*  just to be just because you are in the US. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2705.6s)]
*  The thing is, as the situation now in Syria and my family still there, it's much [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2708.52s)]
*  worse than than in 2011, which led to a whole this kind of civil war. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2712.4s)]
*  But the thing is, people are afraid. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2717.52s)]
*  And this is my main question. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2719.28s)]
*  People are afraid of the change because they saw what happened in Iraq. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2720.88s)]
*  On the other hand, the international community, they always stop on the fact [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2724.28s)]
*  that let's take down Assad and that's it. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2727.44s)]
*  It's like the end of the movie. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2730.1200000000003s)]
*  He's gone. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2731.88s)]
*  People happy. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2732.88s)]
*  The like the heroes of the movie kisses each others and that's it. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2733.96s)]
*  While it's not like this. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2737.6400000000003s)]
*  So my question is very simple. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2739.44s)]
*  Like, what do you are you aware of? [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2741.0800000000004s)]
*  Or do you think that international community plan for the post Assad era? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2743.2400000000002s)]
*  Like, do they have anything that reassure people there who might be against Assad? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2749.32s)]
*  But they said, OK, we saw what happened in those areas where ISIS or not. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2753.32s)]
*  This is what make like a lot of changes and differences in people's mind inside [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2759.1200000000003s)]
*  and outside Syria. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2763.52s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2764.5600000000004s)]
*  This is a question that, in fact, goes well beyond the refugee issue. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2765.48s)]
*  It has to do with the political solution. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2769.0400000000004s)]
*  I think it's more addressed to our Syrian friends. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2770.76s)]
*  Let me just answer very, very quickly. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2773.52s)]
*  And then one of you answer your compatriot and then we'll move on to the next question [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2776.88s)]
*  quickly because I don't want to frustrate a lot of people here. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2782.6800000000003s)]
*  It is a conundrum, Perry. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2788.36s)]
*  I mean, the idea that we are stuck between a rock and a hard place. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2789.84s)]
*  If you want to help Syrians who are displaced within Syria, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2794.56s)]
*  the only way you can provide humanitarian support is through the regime. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2798.76s)]
*  And we're seeing what's happening to that support in many ways and on money fronts. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2802.36s)]
*  I would urge that at least the priority now be focused, which is something also [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2807.7200000000003s)]
*  Graham talked about, at least in areas that are not under regime control and that [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2812.1200000000003s)]
*  provides support there is very quickly on your issues, none that I'm aware of [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2816.56s)]
*  in terms of the post Assad plan. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2821.6400000000003s)]
*  And I think that has been the big gaping hole. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2823.6000000000004s)]
*  I think I mean, we've been saying this for a couple of years now, that this [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2827.84s)]
*  fixation on Assad, it's not a question of Assad only, it's a question of the entire [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2831.2000000000003s)]
*  governance system in Syria and what an inclusive governance system could [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2835.68s)]
*  possibly look like. And there are I mean, there are academic, there's the [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2839.7999999999997s)]
*  Esquad national agenda for Syria. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2845.2s)]
*  There's the day after the other projects, but nothing that I am aware of. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2848.9199999999996s)]
*  Say one word on the political issue. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2856.24s)]
*  Yes, I will let him go into the details for you, but I just don't see any efforts [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2858.8399999999997s)]
*  even now on taking down Assad in first place. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2865.4s)]
*  I don't think there is any plan or international or collective efforts to [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2867.88s)]
*  actually deal with Assad. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2871.96s)]
*  I think there's no efforts on that. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2873.52s)]
*  So I don't I'm not sure about post Assad because I don't see any Syria without [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2875.56s)]
*  Assad regime in the near future. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2879.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, there is probably not even a policy for the areas outside the regime control. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2882.88s)]
*  And even if one connected quickly to the political discussion, now the administration [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2887.7200000000003s)]
*  says we that they want to confront Iran. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2893.08s)]
*  But there is no plans about those areas that the Iranian militias in Syria might [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2895.96s)]
*  march to very, very soon in the south and in the north and in the east. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2901.6s)]
*  Are they going to stop them or not? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2906.36s)]
*  And if they're going to stop them, are they going to put any efforts in those [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2909.0s)]
*  areas? Because again, we care about the Syrians there. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2912.7599999999998s)]
*  We don't want just to punish the regime and then close everything and not to open [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2916.2s)]
*  anything, because as you mentioned, Ahmad, there are your family is there and my [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2920.16s)]
*  family is there and Sena's also have a family there. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2923.48s)]
*  But probably again, there are areas outside the regime control. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2927.32s)]
*  We can at least focus on those areas where there are militias backed by the U.S. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2931.4s)]
*  to to develop some projects there so people can work safely and probably other [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2937.2s)]
*  people can return to those areas at least for them. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2942.12s)]
*  Thank all of you for your work. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2948.76s)]
*  I'm Rachel Carrillo and I've been with United Nations Association and more [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2949.88s)]
*  specifically helping serve with the United Nations Association chapter in Boulder, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2955.28s)]
*  Colorado, on the board. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2959.52s)]
*  And we've we have a national program called Adopt a Future, which is about [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2962.2000000000003s)]
*  educating refugee children. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2968.04s)]
*  And we're working with United Nations High Commission for Refugees in Kenya, not [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2969.48s)]
*  in in Turkey or in Jordan or Lebanon or some of the Syrian refugee camps are. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2973.8s)]
*  But actually in Kenya building schools, so [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2980.28s)]
*  I've got two different questions relating to education. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2985.2400000000002s)]
*  And one is what what is going to be the greatest need [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2989.6s)]
*  for those who are returning in terms of education, what's happened to the education [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2994.12s)]
*  systems and what you know, how can the international community help provide [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=2999.0s)]
*  support? And then the second question is not exactly related, but it's still, you [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3004.04s)]
*  know, globally related. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3009.84s)]
*  It's on the the global compact for migration. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3010.84s)]
*  And if you're the UN's been having a series of talks relating to the global [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3013.64s)]
*  compact for migration, they just had some last week or a week and a half ago, I [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3019.24s)]
*  think. And wondering if your organizations are signing on to this civil society [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3023.84s)]
*  letter to the United Nations for safe, safe. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3030.24s)]
*  It's basically refugee centered and immigrant centered. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3034.24s)]
*  So if you are signing on and if not, why not? [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3037.64s)]
*  Maybe, you can answer this last question and then give us if you have some figures [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3041.4399999999996s)]
*  on the education sector. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3046.4399999999996s)]
*  Maybe yes, the second question here and then we'll go. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3050.8399999999997s)]
*  Thank you very much. I don't mean to be frivolous, but you know, listening to such [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3054.64s)]
*  a sad story in a windowless room makes it even more depressing. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3057.64s)]
*  There is a window here. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3060.64s)]
*  My name is Alexander Kravitz from Insight, Iraq. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3063.64s)]
*  I have I haven't read the report, but I'd like to ask Maha, given that you spoke to [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3066.64s)]
*  the refugees at what you mentioned that they all have a different background. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3075.64s)]
*  You know, that they think of going back. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3080.64s)]
*  But at what point do you think they will stop thinking of going back? [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3083.64s)]
*  At what point does that say kind of reality, unfortunately, you know, sort of set in and [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3087.64s)]
*  might start thinking differently? [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3093.64s)]
*  And I also wonder if you have some numbers, just numbers on the refugees in Iraq. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3095.64s)]
*  In the second question, playing a little bit devil's advocate, you know, I think that [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3100.64s)]
*  the refugees are not going back. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3106.64s)]
*  And if I were a policymaker, I'd start thinking of, you know, how can I help the millions [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3107.64s)]
*  of refugees outside become more permanent? [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3112.64s)]
*  And I wonder if you care to comment on that. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3114.64s)]
*  I think it's because it's fighting up. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3118.64s)]
*  So you have two questions or three and then the specific question about signing the compact [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3121.64s)]
*  agreement. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3127.64s)]
*  On what point will they stop thinking about going back? [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3128.64s)]
*  We saw a change as we were doing the focus groups when it became clear there was a point [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3133.64s)]
*  last year when it became clear that Assad was not going anywhere and they had started [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3139.64s)]
*  regaining ground. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3144.64s)]
*  You could see that the focus groups were not going anywhere. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3145.64s)]
*  And so I think that's a very important point. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3148.64s)]
*  Last year, when it became clear that Assad was not going anywhere and they had started [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3151.64s)]
*  regaining ground, you could already see a shift in the mood of many of the refugees [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3156.64s)]
*  we were talking to, where they started talking about possibly trying to find a way to Europe. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3161.64s)]
*  They realized they are miserable in Lebanon and Jordan. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3167.64s)]
*  They can't stay there because they will be subjected. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3170.64s)]
*  They are being subjected to a lot of discrimination. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3174.64s)]
*  So they start talking about perhaps we can move to Europe temporarily until things quiet [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3176.64s)]
*  down. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3181.64s)]
*  At least you'll have a stable life there. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3182.64s)]
*  Sorry, what was the second question? [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3186.64s)]
*  I don't have any numbers on refugees. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3188.64s)]
*  Education. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3193.64s)]
*  Sorry, we have to. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3196.64s)]
*  Okay, I'm sorry. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3197.64s)]
*  Policymaking. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3203.64s)]
*  Policymaking. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3204.64s)]
*  In Lebanon and Jordan, unfortunately, policy, especially in Lebanon now after the parliament, [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3205.64s)]
*  we just had parliamentary elections, the hype around making refugees go back has increased [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3209.64s)]
*  tremendously. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3214.64s)]
*  There is a realization and there's a lot of panic amongst many politicians who are also [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3216.64s)]
*  now using the refugee issue for populist ends that, yes, refugees are not, I mean, there's [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3221.64s)]
*  no, where do they go back to? [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3227.64s)]
*  There's no place for them to go back. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3229.64s)]
*  So there is an increased rhetoric around we must force them to go back and to push back [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3231.64s)]
*  from the international community saying we can't force people into a situation that will [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3237.64s)]
*  place them in harm's way. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3243.64s)]
*  So I think it is a very serious issue. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3245.64s)]
*  It needs a lot of work because for a country like Lebanon that is four million people to [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3248.64s)]
*  have another million added to it and a country that depends very much on sectarian power [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3253.64s)]
*  balance and power sharing, even though refugees have no political rights, it's still causing [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3259.64s)]
*  a lot of alarm in some circles. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3265.64s)]
*  I think these fears need to recognize, but there has to be work done with the politicians [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3267.64s)]
*  to understand that, again, the populist rhetoric is not going to get us anywhere. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3273.64s)]
*  But I think we're quite far from this. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3279.64s)]
*  Very quickly on education, the biggest educational needs for refugees isn't when they go back. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3282.64s)]
*  The educational system in Syria is in pretty bad state, but even they're not getting access [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3287.64s)]
*  to proper education, especially those above age 12 in host countries. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3293.64s)]
*  Those under age 12 are going to double shift schools. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3298.64s)]
*  So we have, I think, 200,000 out of 400,000, for example, thousand in Lebanon that are [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3302.64s)]
*  accessing schools. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3307.64s)]
*  These are school-age children. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3309.64s)]
*  However, we don't know what the quality of education that they're getting. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3311.64s)]
*  There's little teacher training. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3315.64s)]
*  There are lots of issues. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3317.64s)]
*  Accreditation is a big deal. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3319.64s)]
*  I mean, one can go into a lot of details. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3320.64s)]
*  There's quite a bit of work. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3322.64s)]
*  If you're interested on this, I can share with you some. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3323.64s)]
*  On the global compact, so I'm not sure how much the audience is familiar with the UN [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3328.64s)]
*  current work on migration refugees, but the UN is going for the past, since September, [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3333.64s)]
*  since the Obama summit on migration in September 2016. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3338.64s)]
*  The UN has created two different processes to deal with the migration and the refugee [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3342.64s)]
*  crisis, and this is called Global Compact on Migration and the Global Compact on [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3346.64s)]
*  Refugees. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3351.64s)]
*  And they will be finalized by July and released some in September and some in [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3353.64s)]
*  December. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3359.64s)]
*  The issue is with the global compact, I will speak specifically about the global compact [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3361.64s)]
*  on refugee, is that it was not representative of refugees. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3365.64s)]
*  Refugees had no way to participate in this compact and the formal consultations of UNHCR [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3369.64s)]
*  in Geneva. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3375.64s)]
*  However, what we did at the Network for Refugee Voices, which we only founded in March [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3377.64s)]
*  last year, is that we created, so the network now is an umbrella that has around 40 [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3382.64s)]
*  multinational members from Venezuela, Argentina, Asia Pacific, Africa, Middle East, and [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3388.64s)]
*  refugees. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3394.64s)]
*  So they are mainly refugees and refugee-led organizations. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3396.64s)]
*  We are a refugee-led organization coalition, and we are now the only accredited delegation [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3398.64s)]
*  as a formal seat with the consultation, GCR, the formal consultations. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3404.64s)]
*  So what we're doing as a representative body, and we are always aiming to be more [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3409.64s)]
*  inclusive, so we're always encouraging more refugee-led organizations and refugee [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3415.64s)]
*  changemakers to join us, is that we do a lot of focus groups and we identify specific [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3419.64s)]
*  policies from different refugee communities and we make sure that we communicate these [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3424.64s)]
*  policies to the GCR. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3428.64s)]
*  So this is one of the ways that we are able to communicate our interests and messages [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3430.64s)]
*  as refugees, but it's the only platform that exists so far. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3436.64s)]
*  Okay, Ambassador Katur. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3441.64s)]
*  My question is a follow-up one on education. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3447.64s)]
*  It's my understanding that in Turkey... [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3451.64s)]
*  Ambassador Katur, former Ambassador to Syria. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3453.64s)]
*  Oh, sorry, Ted Katur, CEO of Amityst. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3455.64s)]
*  It's my understanding that in Turkey, they're mainstreaming students into the school system [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3458.64s)]
*  once they teach them Turkish, but of course that raises questions about whether they will [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3464.64s)]
*  be able to read fluently and speak standard Arabic. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3468.64s)]
*  But in Jordan, in Lebanon, you mentioned the double shifts up to 12 in Lebanon. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3478.64s)]
*  Jordan, I wasn't sure what they're doing. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3484.64s)]
*  Jordan's a poor country. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3487.64s)]
*  Lebanon is a heavily indebted country. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3491.64s)]
*  Where are the main sources for educational finance? [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3493.64s)]
*  Because from what you said, this problem's not going away. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3498.64s)]
*  It's going to be possibly generational. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3501.64s)]
*  Okay, we have two ambassadors in a row. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3504.64s)]
*  So Ambassador Gabriel now. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3506.64s)]
*  The mic. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3510.64s)]
*  I want to pick up on something Mahas said now twice, and that is this growing narrative in Lebanon [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3515.64s)]
*  by the leadership and the people. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3521.64s)]
*  The war is over, and people should go home as soon as possible. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3524.64s)]
*  I have a two-part question. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3529.64s)]
*  One is how do we get the leadership of Lebanon to realize the fact that there are no short-term [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3531.64s)]
*  solutions and that they're going to have to start a new dialogue about what the longer-term [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3538.64s)]
*  solutions are? [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3545.64s)]
*  Number two, what are the win-win policies and programs that we can talk about that might [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3547.64s)]
*  address this concern? [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3554.64s)]
*  On that note, because I have a question on that, what was the sensitivity of the Lebanese [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3557.64s)]
*  authorities during your study? [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3564.64s)]
*  I mean, of course they knew about it. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3566.64s)]
*  And what was it after? [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3568.64s)]
*  Because I see one of your recommendations. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3570.64s)]
*  If I'm a Lebanese policymaker, I would jump to the wall, saying that gearing to a job [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3572.64s)]
*  creation for the host country, nationals, and refugees, and et cetera. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3581.64s)]
*  So what has been the reaction of the Lebanese authorities during your study and after it [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3584.64s)]
*  related to Ed Gabriel's question? [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3590.64s)]
*  And then not to forget. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3593.64s)]
*  I'll start with Ambassador Kattouf. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3596.64s)]
*  I mean, most of the financing for education is coming from the international, from the [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3598.64s)]
*  donor community. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3604.64s)]
*  There's hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars and euros going through the [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3606.64s)]
*  ministries of education, both in Lebanon and in Jordan, to create these double shifts. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3611.64s)]
*  But there's also an entire informal educational system happening. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3615.64s)]
*  They call it informal education, which is taking education to children where they are, [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3619.64s)]
*  through NGOs. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3625.64s)]
*  However, this is not accredited, which means that children, if they were to go into the job [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3627.64s)]
*  market, they have no degrees, they have no skills to speak of, they can't access jobs. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3633.64s)]
*  This is a generational issue. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3638.64s)]
*  We have already a lost generation. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3640.64s)]
*  Those that are over age 12 are dropping out of school like flies, unfortunately, mainly [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3642.64s)]
*  because they can't, there's the transition between different educational levels, the lack of [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3648.64s)]
*  capacities. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3655.64s)]
*  They've already lost on years of education. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3656.64s)]
*  The kids who came to Lebanon, they were five. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3658.64s)]
*  Now they are seven years later, they're 12. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3660.64s)]
*  So there are lots of issues, and it's a very complex one. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3663.64s)]
*  There's bullying at school. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3666.64s)]
*  Sometimes the teachers are not well equipped. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3667.64s)]
*  There are lots of challenges that can be addressed and that need to be addressed, but this would [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3669.64s)]
*  not solve the problem down the road. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3674.64s)]
*  The idea of a unified educational system for Syrian students is not there today. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3676.64s)]
*  Kids in Lebanon are getting different, depending if they go to public or private schools, versus [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3681.64s)]
*  the children in Jordan, versus the children in Turkey, not to mention the different curricula [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3686.64s)]
*  that was and is being taught in different areas, depending on who's in control. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3692.64s)]
*  Under ISIS, they stop teaching them anything except for how to take lives, unfortunately. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3697.64s)]
*  So it's a big deal. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3704.64s)]
*  For the Lebanon, and at least for the host country, the recommendation Joel mentioned, [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3706.64s)]
*  yes, people are, to my mind, it depends on who you speak to in the policy, on the policy [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3714.64s)]
*  sphere. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3721.64s)]
*  For example, just from discussions, the office of the prime minister is an office that is [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3722.64s)]
*  very sensitive to this issue, recognizes the concerns of other political parties in the [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3728.64s)]
*  country, but also understands that there's parallel that can be done in terms of pushing [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3738.64s)]
*  people away. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3743.64s)]
*  So they're trying to take the lead and putting together, and this was what part of said, [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3745.64s)]
*  but also part of the Brussels, their plan at the Brussels conference, which is to say, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3750.64s)]
*  you know, we want an eight-year program of job creation, investment in infrastructure, [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3755.64s)]
*  and other such things that will allow us to create employment opportunities for both Lebanese [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3761.64s)]
*  and Syrians. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3766.64s)]
*  This is at the same time while other parts of the government, particularly the office [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3768.64s)]
*  of the president, is coming down and saying, I mean, some of the latest statements have [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3774.64s)]
*  been, you know, they have to go back, and it's safe for them to go back, and they must [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3782.64s)]
*  go back immediately. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3788.64s)]
*  Now, the issue of the refugees is being used by the Syrian regime to also as a political [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3789.64s)]
*  card. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3795.64s)]
*  With, I think, host countries, both Lebanon and Jordan particularly, to say, you know, [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3798.64s)]
*  normalize relations with us, and let's talk. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3804.64s)]
*  Then we can talk about taking people back. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3807.64s)]
*  And the more panic there is around this issue, the more there is a push to kind of push for [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3809.64s)]
*  some sort of normalization of the relations. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3815.64s)]
*  Joe, you asked about the reception before and after. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3818.64s)]
*  During, we had no problems, honestly. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3823.64s)]
*  People were aware we were doing this. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3825.64s)]
*  We discussed this openly. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3827.64s)]
*  There was no secret that we were doing this study. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3828.64s)]
*  But there was no, I think the only kind of shocked reaction I heard was during a meeting [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3831.64s)]
*  where there were members of the EU there, and I made this particular recommendation [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3838.64s)]
*  publicly and verbally. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3843.64s)]
*  And there was a shocked reaction not from officials, but other Lebanese representatives. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3845.64s)]
*  Who were from the private sector saying these kinds of recommendations are not acceptable. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3852.64s)]
*  So I said, well, let's just talk about them. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3857.64s)]
*  Because there needs to be a serious discussion around this issue beyond saying, no, no, no, [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3859.64s)]
*  no, we can't do this. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3864.64s)]
*  No, no, no, it's not acceptable. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3865.64s)]
*  What do you do? [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3867.64s)]
*  Throw a million people in the sea? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3868.64s)]
*  What do you do with them? [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3870.64s)]
*  So there has to be, beyond the humanitarian concerns, so on and so forth, there has to [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3872.64s)]
*  be a serious discussion. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3878.64s)]
*  Politicians can't just keep putting their heads in the sand. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3880.64s)]
*  Last round of questions, Kutayba. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3883.64s)]
*  And then the lady behind the mic. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3886.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3889.64s)]
*  Congratulations on a great report. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3890.64s)]
*  Kutayba Adlbif from Columbia University. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3892.64s)]
*  My question is following up on trends, changing trends. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3894.64s)]
*  I mean, the report started in October 2016. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3898.64s)]
*  A lot has been happening then. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3901.64s)]
*  And you mentioned a report that only one eighth of the refugees would favor an option of [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3903.64s)]
*  resettlement outside Lebanon. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3909.64s)]
*  So my question is, was that the final? [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3911.64s)]
*  Outside Syria. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3914.64s)]
*  Outside Syria, yeah. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3916.64s)]
*  Oh, would that mean outside Lebanon as well or just staying in Lebanon? [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3917.64s)]
*  I mean, also. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3921.64s)]
*  And was that the last result at the end of the study or did you see also changing trends? [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3923.64s)]
*  And taking that in consideration and also probably previous studies, do you think that [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3931.64s)]
*  will change in the future that maybe Syrian refugees with like, you know, the bad situation in [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3937.64s)]
*  Lebanon and the treatment from, you know, the local governments? [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3942.64s)]
*  Would you think that would change in the future and maybe Syrian refugees would refer to go [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3946.64s)]
*  back to Syria or not? [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3950.64s)]
*  You had a question? [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3954.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3955.64s)]
*  Hi, I'm Tara Siegel and I'm a consultant mostly for the bank. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3958.64s)]
*  A quick question. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3962.64s)]
*  You mentioned that justice is a real issue and desire for many refugees, understandably. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3964.64s)]
*  I'm curious as to what justice and accountability mechanisms are most desired. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3969.64s)]
*  Okay, the last question. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3975.64s)]
*  Hi, my name is May Batlini. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3979.64s)]
*  I'm from Beirut and I'm currently interning at the Wilson Center. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3981.64s)]
*  I have a question for all of you concerning U.S. policy. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3983.64s)]
*  What do you think the White House should have as policies concerning the refugees, [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3987.64s)]
*  especially in Lebanon? [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3991.64s)]
*  And Sana, I have one question for you. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3993.64s)]
*  You said that the White House does not have an agenda on Syria and that could actually [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=3995.64s)]
*  solve the issue on Iran. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4000.64s)]
*  Can you briefly elaborate on that? [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4001.64s)]
*  I think I said that. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4004.64s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4006.64s)]
*  Go ahead and then. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4007.64s)]
*  Fine, yeah. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4009.64s)]
*  I mentioned that the White House doesn't have an agenda to address strategically the war [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4011.64s)]
*  in Syria, and I related that to their issues with Iran, not Iraq. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4016.64s)]
*  Yes, which I think now makes sense. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4023.64s)]
*  I have no question. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4025.64s)]
*  But I actually would like to talk about Kutayba's point about, and also your point about, okay, [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4027.64s)]
*  refugees are not returning, so what do we do? [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4035.64s)]
*  And I think this is one of the issues that what you mentioned about, which I say is like [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4038.64s)]
*  citizenship. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4044.64s)]
*  I think giving citizenship to refugees is a solution for the refugee crisis because you [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4045.64s)]
*  would say once we have the option, if I have the option to go back to Syria and I know [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4049.64s)]
*  if something happens, I can return to another country, I would go back to Syria. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4055.64s)]
*  So I think this is one of the suggested solutions that actually was found during a study that [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4059.64s)]
*  was conducted by IDEA, which is a big organization in New York, and they did also survey and [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4065.64s)]
*  research with refugees. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4071.64s)]
*  And they found a lot of refugees that if they were given security and a permanent status [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4073.64s)]
*  in their host country, they would consider going back to at least to visit or to see [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4078.64s)]
*  if they can live in their countries, which leads to the other thing, which is people [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4083.64s)]
*  left to Europe taking the sea because there was no safe passages to Europe. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4088.64s)]
*  There was no safe passages out of host countries, neighboring host countries. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4093.64s)]
*  So creating more ways and safe passages for refugees to leave from Turkey and Jordan to [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4097.639999999999s)]
*  Lebanon to be resettled like the private sponsorship program in Canada, the humanitarian [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4103.639999999999s)]
*  visa by the friends, the humanitarian corridor by Italy, and now Mexico and Brazil and [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4108.639999999999s)]
*  Argentina are doing few programs to safely resettle refugees. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4114.639999999999s)]
*  I think we should encourage more of these programs. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4119.639999999999s)]
*  And I would be curious to know actually what you think about it. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4122.64s)]
*  But I definitely think I mean, these are coping mechanisms. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4126.64s)]
*  Again, I'm not addressing the refugee crisis. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4129.64s)]
*  I'm just I think these are solutions to deal with what we have, not to actually solve what we have. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4132.64s)]
*  Rahim, would you want to say? [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4137.64s)]
*  Maybe just a comment on the policy of the White House. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4139.64s)]
*  Again, I think it's very important that to work on the areas outside the regime control. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4143.64s)]
*  They are controlled now by the Syrian Democratic Forces backed by the U.S. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4147.64s)]
*  The U.S. already has bases there. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4151.64s)]
*  Why they are not taking care of those areas. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4153.64s)]
*  So people, at least part of the refugees can go there. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4156.64s)]
*  But because there is no strategy for that, because probably the policy will be changed in a few weeks. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4159.64s)]
*  Even there is no investment for demining, which is the very, very basic of areas that were [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4164.64s)]
*  controlled by ISIS, at least to do the demining part of it. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4169.64s)]
*  But so far, there is no fund or work or plan by the U.S. or its allies to commit to that. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4174.64s)]
*  Can you wrap up on the question? [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4181.64s)]
*  To add to something Rahim just said, I think beyond working in areas that are under [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4186.64s)]
*  control or where there is not at least under regime control, this has to be part of also some sort of [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4192.64s)]
*  peace dialogue between the Turks and the SDC. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4199.64s)]
*  Because any move, any kind of stabilization in these areas by the U.S. is also being seen as [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4204.64s)]
*  anti-Turkish. So that needs to be taken into account, that political reality. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4209.64s)]
*  In answer to Tayyipa, but also to Sanaa, yes, there was a change in January 1, 8. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4214.64s)]
*  We're saying, well, maybe we're okay with moving to Europe, but the majority said, no, we want to [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4223.64s)]
*  stay here because we want to go back home. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4230.64s)]
*  As I said, as it became clear that Assad was staying, we could feel a shift. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4233.64s)]
*  Given that this is a qualitative study and not a quantitative one, we stayed away from kind of [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4237.64s)]
*  giving these 50%, 90%. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4242.64s)]
*  It doesn't work in these kinds of studies. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4245.64s)]
*  Will this shift again? [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4249.64s)]
*  Will this shift again? [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4250.64s)]
*  Probably. This is a very dynamic situation. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4251.64s)]
*  We're all human beings. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4253.64s)]
*  These are human beings. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4255.64s)]
*  So their calculations, like all of us, change pending circumstances. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4256.64s)]
*  I suspect that at this point, even more people would rather go to Europe. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4262.64s)]
*  One thing is for certain, none of them want to stay in Lebanon. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4266.64s)]
*  That's very sure. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4270.64s)]
*  And slightly more than none of them want to stay in Jordan. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4271.64s)]
*  Most of them really genuinely would like to go back home, at least at this point. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4276.64s)]
*  Will this change as the years pass by and they build their lives there? [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4281.64s)]
*  Probably. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4284.64s)]
*  I mean, this is the normal cycle of things. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4285.64s)]
*  The issue of citizenship would probably cause a major upheaval, to say the least. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4287.64s)]
*  Perhaps before we go to citizenship, I could just see this proposal working its way in Lebanon. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4293.64s)]
*  I'll stop there. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4300.64s)]
*  No. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4303.64s)]
*  I think perhaps we go there. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4304.64s)]
*  One idea that I came across recently is, I don't know how many of you are aware of the Nanseng passport. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4306.64s)]
*  Nanseng passport. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4314.64s)]
*  This is a passport that was issued to refugees after, and it's named after the person who actually issued it. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4316.64s)]
*  I discovered this by accident recently. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4322.64s)]
*  It was issued to refugees after the end of World War II, people who were literally stateless. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4324.64s)]
*  They had lost their passport and had no documentation proving who they were or where they came from. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4331.64s)]
*  And it was almost like a legally recognized paper that was recognized by all the countries post World War II that gave safe passage, [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4338.64s)]
*  but also legal rights to individuals who had been displaced by the conflict, particularly those that came, for example, from Eastern Europe and could no longer go back home. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4346.64s)]
*  So I think it's something, if one can think of a mechanism similar to this, that would be a legal status, but that is not tied to a nation state as such. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4357.64s)]
*  I think this might be a more constructive way to go in terms of at least trying to address some of the challenges. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4369.64s)]
*  I'll be writing more about this. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4378.64s)]
*  The risk of rendering the ring a temporary situation. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4381.64s)]
*  Our time is unfortunately over. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4387.64s)]
*  We should have taken much more time to render justice to such a report. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4389.64s)]
*  I would like to thank Ibrahim and Sana for their remarks and mainly Maha for the tremendous work, and I wish you could push it forward. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4394.64s)]
*  I wish you could join me in thanking our panelists. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4402.64s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4406.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4411.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxru1HHuUA&t=4441.64s)]
