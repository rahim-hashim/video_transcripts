Video Description: Anti-government protests, economic instability, and war have long plagued the Middle East despite the hopes that the Arab Spring would topple authoritarian governments a decade ago. The Arab world already faced a myriad of conflicts and internal divisions before the coronavirus pandemic hit. The question Frederic Wehrey is asking is whether or not the coronavirus  will trigger a second Arab Spring.

# Will the coronavirus launch a second Arab Spring?
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [April 06, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fwfy9vJZQ4)
*  The coronavirus pandemic is likely to have a significant and even transformative effect [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fwfy9vJZQ4&t=0.0s)]
*  on the Arab world. Much of the focus has been on the humanitarian impact on displaced persons [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fwfy9vJZQ4&t=6.08s)]
*  and refugees. While that's certainly significant, it could also have a broader effect on the entire [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fwfy9vJZQ4&t=12.4s)]
*  Arab order. The most damaging and ruinous effects are going to be in those conflict-afflicted [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fwfy9vJZQ4&t=19.04s)]
*  states, Yemen, Syria, and Libya, where there's already an obliterated medical capacity. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fwfy9vJZQ4&t=24.24s)]
*  War in these states is really going to act like a disease amplifier. The fighters there and even [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fwfy9vJZQ4&t=31.52s)]
*  mercenaries could be vectors for the virus. But beyond this, the virus could also impact [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fwfy9vJZQ4&t=37.92s)]
*  seemingly stable Arab states. Now, the wealthy Gulf monarchies, their situation is affected by [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fwfy9vJZQ4&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  low oil prices. And what we'll probably see is they're going to be able to weather this storm, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fwfy9vJZQ4&t=51.92s)]
*  but they could also tighten their belts. And that means they're not going to give [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fwfy9vJZQ4&t=57.28s)]
*  money, as they have before, to poorer Arab states that depended on their assistance during this [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fwfy9vJZQ4&t=60.96s)]
*  crisis. So therefore, Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, these states are really going to be in for a rough time. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fwfy9vJZQ4&t=66.64s)]
*  Now, it's not to say that revolution is going to break out immediately, but we have to remember [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fwfy9vJZQ4&t=74.0s)]
*  that in a number of Arab states before this crisis, there were already protests [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fwfy9vJZQ4&t=78.96s)]
*  underway, not necessarily for democracy, but over governance, things like high prices, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fwfy9vJZQ4&t=83.91999999999999s)]
*  economic inequity, and those demands are not going to go away, and they're possibly going to be [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fwfy9vJZQ4&t=90.96s)]
*  sharpened by this crisis. In addition, the one bright spot in the Arab world, Tunisia, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fwfy9vJZQ4&t=95.91999999999999s)]
*  this democracy is going to be incredibly strained, and how Tunisia navigates this crisis could be a [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fwfy9vJZQ4&t=102.88s)]
*  crucial test for Arab democracy itself. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fwfy9vJZQ4&t=108.8s)]
