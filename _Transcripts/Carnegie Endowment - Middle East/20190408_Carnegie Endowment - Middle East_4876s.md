# Will Sisi be Egyptâ€™s President for Life?
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [April 08, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY)
*  All right, well thank you so much everyone for joining us this afternoon. I'm [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=0.0s)]
*  Susan Glasser from the New Yorker and charter member of the Michelle Dunn [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=5.24s)]
*  fan club who is our fantastic organizer today. But we are here for those of you [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=12.16s)]
*  joining us on livestream as well. We're here at the Carnegie Endowment. This [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=17.32s)]
*  event I should say is sponsored both by Carnegie and by the project on Middle [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=21.44s)]
*  East democracy and it couldn't be more timely. We have the visit of the Egyptian [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=25.92s)]
*  president which is getting underway today and he is scheduled to meet [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=30.6s)]
*  tomorrow I believe at a lunch with Vice President Trump as well as other [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  members of the administration. It comes at a very crucial and interesting time [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=40.64s)]
*  in terms of events inside Egypt. So I'm personally looking forward to the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=45.160000000000004s)]
*  insights and thoughts of everyone here today on the panel. There'll also be lots [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=50.32000000000001s)]
*  of time hopefully for your questions as well. So let me just thank you for [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=54.92s)]
*  sharing your time with us and I guess we'll just jump right in. Let me quickly [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  introduce each of our panelists and then you'll hear a lot more from them. As I [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=63.32s)]
*  mentioned going from the left there Michelle Dunn is our host today and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  organizer and she is the director of the Middle East program here at Carnegie. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=73.76s)]
*  And so Michelle thank you very much. Now we also have joining us at Motaz el [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=79.12s)]
*  Fajiri who is now in a new role as the general coordinator of the Egyptian [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=83.92s)]
*  Rights Forum and I think we'll talk a little bit more about this as a new [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=89.08s)]
*  sort of umbrella group of human rights groups. Thank you so much for joining us [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=93.92s)]
*  today. And then on my right we have May El-Sadani who is the legal and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=98.84s)]
*  judicial director at the Tarrier Center, the Tarrier Institute for Middle East [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=106.16s)]
*  Policy. And all of them have long experience with these issues both [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=109.96s)]
*  operating inside Egypt and and more recently for reasons we will discuss [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=114.83999999999999s)]
*  outside of Egypt as well. So I have to say thank you to all of them. And May I [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=119.08s)]
*  I'd like to start with you because you know the context that we all have here [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=124.63999999999999s)]
*  in Washington obviously is the president's visits here. But why is it so [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=128.64s)]
*  significant in terms of the timing and what what is going on inside of Egypt [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=134.76s)]
*  that would lead one to want to have a visit like this with the Trump [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=140.2s)]
*  administration today? Thank you Carnegie Infomed for inviting me and thank you [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=144.51999999999998s)]
*  Susan for moderating today. The constant so in Egypt right now the Egyptian [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  Parliament is considering constitutional amendments that would really threaten to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=155.44s)]
*  severely change the nature of the Egyptian state. They would do a few [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=159.92s)]
*  things. On the very macro level these amendments would change the relationship [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=163.6s)]
*  between citizens and the state and what's owed to them, the obligations in [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=169.16s)]
*  that relationship. On the institutional level they would threaten to expand the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=172.88s)]
*  authority of the executive and the military at the expense of a more [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=177.88s)]
*  independent judicial and legal system as well. And in the immediate they threaten [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=182.0s)]
*  to extend the lifeline of a government that has not been effective in [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=187.44s)]
*  demonstrating long-term vision when it comes to dealing with economic challenges [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=192.12s)]
*  like demographic changes, water security, food security. When it comes to the war [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=196.72s)]
*  on terror it's been there have been the use of slash-and-burn tactics and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=202.0s)]
*  collective punishment without a long term sense of vision and just an overall [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=206.36s)]
*  rights deterioration that's facilitated via the use of the law. So the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=211.24s)]
*  constitutional amendments would threaten to formalize that. And if I may I just [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=215.76s)]
*  want to go quickly through sort of five of the constitutional amendments and the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=220.12s)]
*  implications they would have on the state. Well I do want you to get to that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=224.52s)]
*  especially because I think one thing people may not appreciate here in [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=228.28s)]
*  Washington is the extent to which this is so dramatic. I mean we're talking [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=232.84s)]
*  about a significant revision you know of the constitutional order. This isn't just [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=237.44s)]
*  sort of one let me extend the presidential term right. I mean this is [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=242.32s)]
*  essentially restructuring the government to make official what has [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=246.16s)]
*  been you know de facto if not de jure already right. Absolutely and it's not [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=250.48s)]
*  just even about President Sisi or the presidency itself. It's so much more than [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=255.96s)]
*  that I would say. As early as 2000 as early as the last presidential election [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=260.6s)]
*  we began hearing MPs speak about the possibility of constitutional [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=266.08s)]
*  amendments. So they were paving the way for the Egyptian state to kind of get [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=270.12s)]
*  used to this idea that we're in a special time a critical time if you will [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=273.72s)]
*  and that there's a need for an extension of the mandate of this government. It [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=277.88s)]
*  began being presented on in MPs dialogues on Egyptian television and [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=281.40000000000003s)]
*  sort of since then we've seen the official introduction of the draft [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=286.88s)]
*  constitutional amendments which are likely up for a final vote and this [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=291.04s)]
*  weekend April 14th is when the debate is scheduled to begin. Thereafter there will [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=295.64s)]
*  be a national referendum but the issue here is that there hasn't been space [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=300.24s)]
*  for Egyptians to mobilize or talk or even learn about the amendments because [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=304.12s)]
*  the initial framing was about President Sisi and his ability to continue and and [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=308.52s)]
*  building on the charisma that some people viewed him to have because it [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=313.36s)]
*  became sort of a matter of people and a person rather than institutions it [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=317.76s)]
*  becomes that much more difficult for a population that has no access to an [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  independent media that does not have a functioning civil society to really [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=326.88s)]
*  engage with the amendments understand what's in them. Egyptian media does not [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=331.2s)]
*  talk about the substance of the amendments at all. They don't explain how [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=335.15999999999997s)]
*  it affects the nature of the state. It's all about the presidency and the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=339.68s)]
*  accomplishments of this presidency when in fact the amendments like you said do [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=343.32s)]
*  do a lot more than just allow a president to run for re-election. So what [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=348.42s)]
*  we've heard most commonly in the Western media is that the amendments would [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=353.36s)]
*  extend the presidential term limits from four from four years to six years with a [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=356.8s)]
*  maximum of two consecutive terms. They would have an additional provision that [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=361.32s)]
*  just applies to President Sisi, the current president, to run for re-election [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=365.2s)]
*  under the new terms which is why we've heard that he would stay in power until [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=369.68s)]
*  at least 2034. But beyond that it's much more than the presidency right? It's [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=373.24s)]
*  about empowering the president to appoint the heads of judicial bodies. So [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=378.48s)]
*  if you have a president who's selecting the heads of a judiciary at a time when [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=383.48s)]
*  there is an increasingly politicized judiciary you don't have the ability to [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=387.52s)]
*  challenge rulings. You don't have the ability to challenge legislation that's [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=391.56s)]
*  passed disproportionately by the executive. So you don't have a space to [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=395.76s)]
*  really change institutionally. So you're closing up the space for peaceful [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=399.44s)]
*  transfer of power for systematic change from within the state all of which are [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=403.76s)]
*  really central and important foundations of any functioning state. In addition to [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=408.72s)]
*  the amendments on the judiciary there's an amendment that would define the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=413.68s)]
*  military as the protector of the Constitution and query what that means [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=417.36s)]
*  at a time when you have a constitutional and when you have judicial and [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=421.8s)]
*  legislative powers that are supposed to interpret and engage with the [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=425.20000000000005s)]
*  Constitution's not the armed forces which their mandate is to protect the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=428.72s)]
*  country not to interpret a legal document and query as to what power it [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=433.08000000000004s)]
*  authorizes it and whether that it places the armed forces above the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=437.42s)]
*  legislature and the judiciary bodies that are meant to be engaging with the [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=441.42s)]
*  Constitution. The amendments also extend the jurisdiction of military courts. One [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=445.26s)]
*  of the trends that we've unfortunately seen in Egypt in the last few years is [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=450.66s)]
*  an escalation in the use of military courts between 2014 and 2016 a two-year [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=454.02000000000004s)]
*  period alone 7,400 civilians were brought to trial before a military court system [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=459.90000000000003s)]
*  that doesn't have access to an appeal system that isn't transparent under [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=465.66s)]
*  which confessions on the basis of torture are acceptable forms of admitted [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=470.58s)]
*  evidence so you have a lot of concerns there complicating the ability of [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=475.18s)]
*  citizens access to justice as well and then finally the amendments would also [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=479.9s)]
*  introduce in a second house of Parliament which in and of itself is not [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=484.02s)]
*  a problem here in the US we have a bicameral legislature the issue is that [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=488.74s)]
*  the second house of Parliament would be made of one-third appointed members [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=492.78000000000003s)]
*  members who are not accountable to their to their constituents really eating away [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=496.74s)]
*  at the ability of a legislature to serve its people to meet the demands of the [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=501.82s)]
*  people so if we kind of zoom out and ask what this means it's really that we [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=505.74s)]
*  were seeing the deterioration of Egyptian state institutions at the [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=510.38s)]
*  expense of the executive and the military we're seeing a redefining of [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=514.22s)]
*  the relationship between citizens and the state and what they can expect to be [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=519.0600000000001s)]
*  owed to them and we're seeing this extension of a government of the lifeline [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=522.26s)]
*  of a government that really hasn't been able to meet the demands of its people [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=526.7s)]
*  which raises questions on Egypt's long-term stability its security and [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=529.98s)]
*  honestly its ability to be a good partner to the United States and other [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=534.26s)]
*  countries so just a little bit to talk about that no but I think it's really [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=537.34s)]
*  important to start with the first principles about you know what exactly [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=541.66s)]
*  we're talking about here so what house I want to bring you into this first of all [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=544.46s)]
*  do you can you help us to understand why you think this is happening now in other [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=550.18s)]
*  words why does the government even feel compelled to do this and what does it [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=554.86s)]
*  mean does it essentially enshrine in the Constitution the inability of people [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=558.62s)]
*  like you to do your work inside Egypt well I like also to thank a Carnegie and [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=565.62s)]
*  permit for providing me here in Washington to convey our concern on the [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=570.86s)]
*  current situation from a right in Egypt actually I just remember today that in [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=575.86s)]

*  and more humanized defender who have been prosecuted in the country is also an [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=813.42s)]

*  counterterrorism law all of these laws that are sort of formalizing the [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1086.3s)]
*  practices I think that's something to keep in mind that these are not random [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1090.34s)]
*  events they're systemized and institutionalized by the state [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1094.46s)]

*  actually to my opening question to Michelle which is put this in context [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1100.5s)]
*  for us a little bit I have to say for someone like me who's not you know had [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1105.5s)]
*  the chance to follow sort of every single step along the way that's gotten [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1109.86s)]
*  us where we are from you know kind of the upheaval of 2011 2012 to this moment [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1114.42s)]
*  I mean there's an argument to be made I know some people who closely follow [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1122.42s)]
*  Egypt you make the argument that we are now already in a situation where this is [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1126.62s)]
*  more of a repressive moment than even say the latter stages of the Mubarak era [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1130.78s)]
*  do you do you agree with that and and and again help us to contextualize like [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1136.34s)]
*  why are we at this moment and you know do you agree that this is in fact a [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1141.34s)]
*  threshold thing that the effort to create a major constitutional order [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1148.46s)]
*  around president okay thank you thanks for being with us today Susan and thanks [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1154.42s)]
*  to Dema Tezzane for being here yeah I think this I think this is a very [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1161.6200000000001s)]
*  important moment with the constitutional amendments I've heard some people say to [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1167.5s)]
*  me well look we know that you know things have been moving in this direction [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1171.3s)]
*  for a long time it's just more of the same whatever I don't think so I think [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1175.1s)]
*  this is really crossing crossing into a new era with these constitutional [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1180.2199999999998s)]
*  amendments I mean it certainly is saying to Egyptians that everything they [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1186.26s)]
*  struggled for from 2011 onward is completely destroyed right because it's [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1191.3s)]
*  putting even the presidential term limits it's putting it back to pretty [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1197.6999999999998s)]
*  much the same situation that Mubarak had and then it's even going beyond that [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1200.94s)]
*  you know as you've heard from May and Mata's I would say under Mubarak for [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1206.74s)]
*  example there there certainly was more room for the judiciary to operate and [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1212.06s)]
*  you even had situations it wasn't a completely free judiciary but it but it [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1217.42s)]
*  was certainly freer and certainly in terms of the human rights situation [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1221.66s)]
*  there's no comparison I mean there are the number of political prisoners in [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1227.34s)]
*  Egypt today and practices such as extensive use of enforced disappearance [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1232.1s)]

*  often under Mubarak they were much more rarely used there were political [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1246.4599999999998s)]
*  prisoners there was torture and so forth under Mubarak but some of these other [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1250.82s)]
*  things were not and they and they really have have terrorized the population so [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1254.82s)]
*  you know that's where we are it isn't getting better I mean if you look at [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1259.3799999999999s)]
*  human rights reports that have come out recently just reviewing for example what [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1262.82s)]
*  happened during the year 2018 the numbers are really shocking the number [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1267.34s)]
*  of people disappeared the number of people dying in prison whether from [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1271.7s)]
*  medical neglect or torture the number of extrajudicial killings in a very [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1275.5s)]
*  troubling recent report speaking about documenting how in many cases extrajudicial [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1281.18s)]
*  killings have been they've been staged as looking as though they were counter [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1288.26s)]
*  terrorism raids when they were really people pulled out of detention and and [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1293.22s)]
*  they're your killing staged so there are a lot of you know shocking things going [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1296.5800000000002s)]
*  on and you know why are you you've asked a couple of times now Susan why is this [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1300.94s)]
*  happening now with the constitutional amendments I've heard some different [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1305.42s)]
*  theories about this I mean Matt has has said this has been you know sort of in [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1309.06s)]
*  a line in the plan with what CC has had to consolidate his control and I think [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1313.18s)]
*  that's true but they also seem to be sort of trying to get this done now and [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1318.18s)]
*  trying to get it done pretty quickly I've heard some different theories about [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1322.38s)]
*  that some theories about the international political situation that [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1325.74s)]
*  that could make this a particularly good time for CC to get this done his current [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1332.22s)]
*  term ends in 2022 he had a very uncomfortable end of his first term when [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1337.3799999999999s)]
*  all of a sudden people popped up wanting to run against him and so forth so I [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1343.22s)]
*  think he doesn't want to let this go too long he wants to have this all taken [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1346.6999999999998s)]
*  care of well before the end of his his current term and maybe the presence of [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1351.1399999999999s)]
*  President Trump in in the US possibly a BB Netanyahu in Israel I mean he's got a [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1356.98s)]
*  very congenial situation internationally with no one who's going to give him a [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1363.74s)]
*  very hard time there are also maybe more economic hard times coming in Egypt as [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1369.9s)]
*  they continue to bring down energy subsidies and try to manage the currency [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1375.6200000000001s)]
*  and so forth so there may be reasons why he wants to get this done and his visit [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1381.02s)]
*  to the US is perfectly timed as as May said the Egyptian Parliament is just [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1386.86s)]
*  about done with their final review they will very shortly approve these [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1393.26s)]
*  amendments and then we will start the the popular referendum will take place [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1398.22s)]
*  before the end of this month and so you know it really is it's it's almost as [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1403.06s)]
*  though CC is up for election again himself because as May said in Egypt [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1407.94s)]
*  these amendments are all about CC and you know usually in the past the United [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1412.66s)]
*  States has been a little careful about that type of thing you know about [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1417.06s)]
*  inviting somebody here to Washington just a week or two before in effect he [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1420.1s)]
*  goes up for a popular election but that's that's not the case this time [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1425.6999999999998s)]
*  that's right and I'm glad you brought that up I want to ask all of you that's [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1429.78s)]
*  the inescapable context at least for a Washington conversation this in Egypt [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1433.1799999999998s)]
*  it's hard for me to imagine it seems to me you're being gentle even in that [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1438.74s)]
*  characterization Michelle in the past we had an enormous months if not years long [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1443.62s)]
*  fight here in Washington over even the question of a whether it should be based on human [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1448.22s)]
*  rights abuses inside of Egypt the idea that a massive dramatic revision of the [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1456.14s)]
*  constitutional order in order to what appears to eliminate or severely [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1463.6200000000001s)]
*  curtail the vestiges of democracy inside Egypt in the past as we all know that [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1468.66s)]
*  would have been the kind of front page story that it simply hasn't been [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1474.62s)]
*  recently for some understandable reasons it does appear that this timing is no [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1477.8999999999999s)]
*  coincidence in terms of and what appears to be offering essentially the US [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1483.5s)]
*  administration's in premature on this fairly dramatic constitutional political [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1489.54s)]
*  move do you let me ask both of our other panelists do you believe that that's how [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1495.78s)]
*  will be seen inside of Egypt as the endorsement or the de facto support of [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1501.62s)]
*  the Trump administration and how important is that to President cc's [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1507.34s)]
*  campaign I think it's immensely important that photo op that he's going [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1511.4599999999998s)]
*  to get at the in the Oval Office alongside President Trump sends the [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1516.86s)]
*  message that we are we consider Egypt a stable partner and an ally no matter [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1520.8s)]
*  what you do and that no matter what you do is a very dangerous message to send [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1525.2199999999998s)]
*  both to Egyptians inside the country who still believe in preserving democratic [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1529.62s)]
*  values and principles and to other to the region other autocrats who are [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1534.9799999999998s)]
*  watching and taking note from this example I think it's undeniable that [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1540.7399999999998s)]
*  just a few days before the vote goes on he's here emphasizing the US Egyptian [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1544.7399999999998s)]
*  relationship with likely no mention of human rights in the readouts which we've [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1551.26s)]
*  seen unfortunately since the US administration has taken home there is [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1555.7199999999998s)]
*  rarely talk of human rights in the readouts it's often about economy or [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1559.34s)]
*  counterterrorism without any sort of nuanced conversation about what the [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1563.4599999999998s)]
*  state of the of the state the actual nature of the state is and how it [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1567.86s)]
*  affects the everyday lives of people so I think it's hard it's impossible to [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1571.58s)]
*  distance that and I think it will definitely be used capitalized that [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1575.62s)]
*  visit is going to be covered in Egyptian media and it will be covered in a in a [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1579.22s)]
*  single way because it's a state controlled media as Martha's was [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1583.5s)]
*  alluding to and so how much of a factor in what does do you think that the the [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1586.46s)]
*  kind of Trump administration's in the premature is for president I know that [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1592.6200000000001s)]
*  you know very early on actually the campaign was very complimentary of him [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1598.22s)]
*  and the timing of this just just seems inescapable way that actually we saw a [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1603.66s)]
*  lot of direct reelection support for Prime Minister Netanyahu in would have [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1610.3s)]
*  been front page news but have not been too much with the overall position is [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1619.62s)]
*  that the US administration's executive support to President Sisi and they think [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1628.1399999999999s)]
*  is that having someone in power that they consider him strong enough that can [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1635.18s)]
*  you know protect Egypt from falling apart like other countries in the region [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1641.54s)]
*  but I think this view as things three panelists it challenges this this view [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1646.5s)]
*  there are windows and opportunities in United States to change that gradually [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1653.78s)]
*  and to get some minor small gradual victory when it comes to human rights and [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1659.06s)]
*  I think this happened already over the past two or three years there are some [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1665.74s)]
*  prisoners who were released in Egypt because of the pressure made by United [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1670.1s)]
*  States and when it comes to international pressure is a United [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1675.26s)]
*  States is decisive its foreign policy to Egypt especially its leverage on the [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1678.86s)]
*  and in Europe also present since he was aware that he needs this kind of [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1685.1399999999999s)]
*  international support he signed military deals with France Germany Italy and he [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1691.58s)]
*  received his support but we saw also recently France gradually started to [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1697.8999999999999s)]
*  talk about human rights in the last visit of President Macron he no received [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1701.82s)]
*  ten human rights defenders who are involved in a in case 173 on foreign [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1706.98s)]
*  funding and it was a very challenging move to businesses so I think it is up [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1712.46s)]
*  to us as Egyptian human rights defender in the Aspura I think to work hard on [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1717.82s)]
*  that with our of course allies in the United States in Europe to challenge [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1723.98s)]
*  this view and to try to change it for the sake of Egyptian people no so this [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1729.9s)]
*  is very interesting so your point is that even if President Trump remains you [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1734.5s)]
*  know gives him the photo op gives him the picture in the Oval Office gives him a [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1738.6200000000001s)]
*  tweet that you still see the US and other potential Western allies as having [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1742.38s)]
*  enough leverage over the Sisi government what are you specifically thinking of [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1747.0200000000002s)]
*  pressure on arms sales we're going to talk about that in a second of course [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1754.7s)]
*  pressure on arms sales is very important and crucial the American weapons are [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1759.14s)]
*  used against Egyptian civilians it's very simple Egyptian and foreign as well [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1763.42s)]
*  there are cases for people who innocent people who killed by the military machine [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1768.74s)]
*  in Egypt so this is something in term of legitimacy and moral responsibility [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1773.66s)]
*  United States should act to that but I think given the diversity in American [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1778.82s)]
*  institution there are opportunities to surround the Egyptian government with [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1784.58s)]
*  this kind of moral responsibility I see today in American media [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1791.26s)]
*  editorial in Washington Post more kinds how they speak about the record of [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1797.74s)]
*  breathing CC is a Congress the position of some congressmen who are who are very [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1802.74s)]
*  supportive to Egyptian people and humanized defenders the same in Europe [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1808.7s)]
*  also and this is a very long battle public opinion is important government [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1812.74s)]
*  action are made by public opinion in the West and I think for us as Egyptian [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1818.14s)]
*  humanized defender I believe that this kind of soft power by media institution [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1822.78s)]
*  civil society institution is very important and they give you here one [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1827.3799999999999s)]
*  example in France because I'm personally involved with an advocacy more in Europe [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1830.6999999999998s)]

*  important working with civil society institution trade unions media [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1864.94s)]
*  institution to pressure government in the West not just actually to to to [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1868.42s)]
*  consider Egyptian people but they consider their own society their own [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1875.1000000000001s)]
*  public opinion because this taxpayer are promoting repression in Egypt [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1879.26s)]
*  president Trump says that this will achieve stability for you but what we [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1886.54s)]
*  are seeing today more radicalization among young people more young people [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1890.3799999999999s)]

*  achieve stability for the West well let me let me ask Michelle I mean you know [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1900.14s)]
*  obviously what Motaz is describing essentially is the kind of activism we [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1904.98s)]
*  actually were familiar with in previous era of US Egyptian relations and civil [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1909.18s)]
*  society activism and you know American administrations carving out space to do [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1915.0s)]
*  things is that still possible in the Trump administration given the opacity [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1920.3s)]
*  of decision-making and the president's own personal predilection for this and [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1925.42s)]
*  what appears to be a general withdrawal of US leadership in the region because [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1931.22s)]
*  that's the other context we haven't talked about today but I want to ask you [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1935.46s)]
*  where this fits in are we seeing some of these developments actually as a [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1938.74s)]
*  response to the US being less involved and then it used to be what I think the [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1944.38s)]
*  Trump administration has been doing and will do is raise individual cases of [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1949.6s)]
*  Americans imprisoned in Egypt of whom there are may you probably have a better [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1955.42s)]
*  count than I do but there are you know more than more than a dozen 20 years [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1960.22s)]
*  and it doesn't I've heard about 20 and just to slip it in there I'll give it [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1964.86s)]
*  back to you right away one of the individuals who was detained in the [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1968.22s)]
*  aftermath of the train crash which happened recently around the expressions [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1971.22s)]
*  against the constitutional amendments is an American citizen right and then [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1976.06s)]
*  again right and there have been more and more right so there are American [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1979.7s)]
*  citizens and maybe some green cold green card holders the Trump [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1982.8600000000001s)]
*  administration will raise privately they you know perhaps the case of someone [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1987.82s)]
*  like April Corley the American woman you just alluded to her I think Montez [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=1994.86s)]
*  who was gravely wounded in this attack with Apache helicopters in the desert [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2000.3799999999999s)]
*  2015 and who still has not received any kind of reasonable settlement from the [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2008.02s)]
*  Egyptian government so they might raise things like this the problem is that I [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2013.78s)]
*  think this administration in particular will resist raising the structural issues [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2019.34s)]
*  that then end up having a very very negative and widespread effects on human [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2025.4599999999998s)]
*  rights I mean whether it's the constitutional amendments the [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2032.8999999999999s)]
*  politicization of the courts military trials of civilians abysmal treatment [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2035.58s)]
*  in prison between torture and so forth Montez was just speaking about [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2041.78s)]
*  radicalization among particularly young people in Egyptian prisons extremely [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2045.7s)]
*  dangerous these are sort of the larger issues that I think unfortunately this [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2051.7s)]
*  administration doesn't see or doesn't agree with or doesn't want to get into [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2056.02s)]
*  to be honest with you all administrations have disliked you know raising those [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2060.46s)]
*  larger structural issues because then it oh is it interference in their politics [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2065.42s)]
*  and so forth but some administrations have done it more than others normally [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2069.62s)]
*  it falls to the Congress and that's even more the case now than before and [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2073.46s)]
*  Congress does have the power of the purse string and it does have a say as [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2078.1s)]
*  you know it's a negotiation back and forth between the Congress and the [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2083.26s)]
*  administration over things like conditions on military assistance well [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2086.38s)]
*  that's right and so let's talk just quickly and I'll bring everybody into [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2092.1s)]
*  this but Michelle if you can start us off what is the regional context it's [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2095.5s)]
*  very interesting a we're talking about the long-term support of the United [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2099.14s)]
*  States for the Egyptian military but you actually now have an interesting [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2104.1s)]
*  situation where there are major arms purchases fighter jets from Russia that [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2107.42s)]
*  President Sisi is contemplating how much is the administration going to make that [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2112.94s)]
*  an issue is that is that a potential rift between the two and also you see [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2117.14s)]
*  this visit coming we haven't mentioned Libya but it's very interesting that you [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2124.3399999999997s)]
*  actually have a situation where the Egyptians along with other US partners [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2128.18s)]
*  in the Gulf in particular UAE and Saudi Arabia are backing one side in what [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2133.22s)]
*  appears to be this escalating fight inside of Libya and the United States at [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2138.94s)]
*  least for the moment appears to be on the other side with the sticking with [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2143.74s)]
*  the UN backed government so how does that play in is that something that we'll [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2148.54s)]
*  see any hint of publicly disagreement with I doubt we will see that publicly [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2153.58s)]
*  but but it's a curious situation because while on the one hand there we can see [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2159.66s)]
*  some some affinity and the President Trump has an affinity for strongmen and [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2165.8199999999997s)]
*  CC's a strongman and as Maut has said I think that you know CC's been able to [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2170.14s)]
*  project himself you know as the one who can keep hold of Egypt amidst you know [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2176.22s)]
*  as we see now Libya Algeria Sudan you know a lot of unrest going on in the [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2180.94s)]
*  region and so forth and you know he's been a he's been a steady military and [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2187.14s)]
*  intelligence partner to Israel so you know that is there and and I think [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2191.7400000000002s)]
*  President CC has also been able to project himself as the friend of [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2197.34s)]
*  Christians inside of Egypt and the friend of women I would dispute those I [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2204.6600000000003s)]
*  will let my colleagues if they want to say more about about his actual record [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2209.8199999999997s)]
*  on those issues but but I think there are those in the Trump administration I [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2213.62s)]
*  mean Ivanka Trump tweeted about this recently who accept that who believe [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2218.3399999999997s)]
*  that he's doing great things for for women and for Christians inside of Egypt [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2222.3399999999997s)]
*  so that's on the what I think the Trump administration would have used the [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2227.5s)]
*  positive side of the leisure on the other side of the ledger though Susan I [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2230.8599999999997s)]
*  mean CC is he actually opposes US positions on many issues right so on [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2235.22s)]
*  Libya on Syria I mean CC's been on the other the other side of this issue from [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2242.38s)]
*  the United States he's not been now maybe the Trump administration is sort [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2248.02s)]
*  of you know pulling up stakes a bit and not taking big interest but at least the [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2251.82s)]
*  positions that CC have had have been the other side I think even on the Arab [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2255.94s)]
*  Israeli peace issue and that that is an issue that think is still of some [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2263.7s)]
*  importance to the White House yeah CC does not support what sorry well that's [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2267.3799999999997s)]
*  right I want to ask everybody about that question especially in light of Netanyahu [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2274.3399999999997s)]
*  last-minute campaign announcement that he's considering beginning annexation so [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2278.06s)]
*  while while we know that CC is no great friend to the Palestinians at the same [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2283.8999999999996s)]
*  time you know I think for all these Arab allies of Trump the position on [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2288.78s)]
*  Jerusalem now on Golan and if indeed Israel moves forward to to annex parts [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2293.7400000000002s)]
*  of the West Bank and and the US administration recognize that that puts [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2300.5400000000004s)]
*  these Arab leaders in a very uncomfortable position it's humiliating [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2305.9s)]
*  frankly you know and and and you know their populations I was just reading an [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2309.5400000000004s)]
*  article in the Arabic press from Egypt today about all these all these [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2315.2200000000003s)]
*  Egyptian parliamentarians speaking up and they're all supporting CC's visit and [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2318.46s)]
*  how wonderful it's gonna be every single one though mentioned we have a real [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2322.7s)]
*  problem on Jerusalem and Golan and where this administration is going on this [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2326.06s)]
*  issue so I think that's you know it's problematic I mean regarding Gaza and so [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2330.14s)]
*  forth you know count on CC to do what's in Egypt's national interest I don't [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2334.98s)]
*  think he's gonna do more of that and the kind of a role that Israel and that [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2339.38s)]
*  Netanyahu and that President Trump and others may view that they would like to [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2344.62s)]
*  see CC take on in Gaza I'm doubtful that he would be able to that the security [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2349.8599999999997s)]
*  establishment would support that and then there's Russia and you know the [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2354.74s)]
*  thing is look if you I I do think it's a concern of this administration and we've [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2358.58s)]
*  already seen them engaging I mean if only for commercial reasons they don't [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2366.02s)]
*  want to see more and more arms sales going to Russia and then there are [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2369.7799999999997s)]
*  security reasons as well we've seen a big issue with Turkey obviously and now [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2373.9s)]
*  the the purchase the contract that Egypt has supposedly made for these fighter [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2378.54s)]
*  aircraft I think would bring into play the CAATSA sanctions the countering [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2384.7000000000003s)]
*  America's adversaries you know sanctions now the administrative there would be a [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2391.94s)]
*  choice maybe as to whether to apply them or not but I think it seems that that [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2397.82s)]
*  purchase would be sanctionable so I do think these things are problematic and [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2401.46s)]
*  just to connect this back to the constitutional amendments let's [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2406.66s)]
*  remember these constitutional amendments are not about securing the stability of [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2410.7s)]
*  Egypt they are about securing CC's hold on power and persistence in power and [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2415.82s)]
*  the question is even for the Trump administration is he really an asset on [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2422.78s)]
*  these issues more than some other Egyptian president would be I don't think [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2427.9s)]
*  so I think in many cases his actual positions are are not really what what [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2433.78s)]
*  they would like them to be well you know it's interesting it disconnects I think [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2439.6600000000003s)]
*  to May's original point which is that it's we can't untwine the arguments over [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2442.98s)]
*  this is record and what kind of a leader he is and that and these [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2451.42s)]
*  constitutional amendments and that is partially why there's been so little [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2455.38s)]
*  debate about you know the long-term impact of doing something like this [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2458.7400000000002s)]
*  right like you know here we are arguing over what kind of a president CC is and [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2462.54s)]
*  what what we should make of him as a partner of the US so there's a lot to [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2467.26s)]
*  unpack in what Michelle just said but I want to ask you specifically about this [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2470.86s)]
*  this notion that's here in Washington in particular Ivanka Trump tweeting that [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2475.34s)]
*  he's a friend to women is that is that possibly true is there the idea of this [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2480.78s)]
*  is a bulwark to minority sort of an outpost of moderation in a sea of [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2487.5800000000004s)]
*  potential extremism that that seems to be the marketing what the reality I [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2493.5800000000004s)]
*  think Egypt is doing a good job at framing itself as the things that the [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2498.2200000000003s)]
*  US wants it to be whether that's a regional partner whether that's a [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2504.38s)]
*  supporter of minorities whether that's a proponent of women it knows sort of [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2508.1s)]
*  what the West is interested in what the catch terms are which what the phrases [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2512.38s)]
*  are that will get people's attention and that will attract the support that it [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2516.46s)]
*  needs but I think that couldn't be farther from the truth even very briefly [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2521.42s)]
*  on the regional issue president Egypt is not does not have the same regional [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2524.94s)]

*  and the economy well I just remind the audience that CC has he has had shameful [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2681.92s)]
*  record or woman and the rights of woman in 2011 when he was the director of the [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2687.6s)]

*  shocking and so far it has not been investigated so I cannot you know trust [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2708.8s)]
*  this man to do any progress in the right of format but just like so the Arabi also [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2713.64s)]
*  using the file of form and to market itself internationally but in home for [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2718.72s)]
*  Saudi Arabia and Egypt prosecute woman human rights defenders and prosecute [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2723.7999999999997s)]
*  those people who defend rights of women saying something also on foreign policy [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2727.6s)]
*  I think today in the region this is applied to Egypt and other countries [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2732.0s)]
*  including Saudi Arabia Emirates well the dynamics of counter-revolution burden [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2735.3599999999997s)]
*  foreign policy of these countries and the price is high for the people in the [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2740.8399999999997s)]
*  in Syria and in Libya today after after he represent the model and trying to [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2746.04s)]
*  copy paste the model of businesses and that's why United Arab Emirates Egypt [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2753.56s)]
*  they give him support in his move inside Libyan so this foreign policy Egyptian [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2758.12s)]
*  foreign policy obstruct peaceful resolution of the conflict in Libya so [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2764.2400000000002s)]
*  and it will continue like that because I think repressive policies inside Egypt [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2769.92s)]
*  and the dynamics of maintaining power and constantly the consolidating power [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2774.04s)]
*  has some kind of regional dimension because now we are talking on the [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2778.8s)]
*  regional polarization there is a group of regional actors who work hard to [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2782.4s)]
*  repress any democratic transition happening in the region in Algeria today [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2789.12s)]
*  the forces of the counter-revolution started to be very strong in Algeria [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2792.88s)]
*  these days with the repression and detention among activists and this is [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2797.04s)]
*  also based on instruction and support by some regional power going into the [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2801.4s)]
*  economy one thing that President Sisi has been brazed for is economic measures [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2806.32s)]
*  that have been taken so far so this is a testimony I mean presented by the IMF [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2810.6400000000003s)]
*  recently because there is we cannot distinct between politics and and the [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2815.6400000000003s)]
*  economy in Egypt case well IMF says Egypt gross model need to evolve by [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2821.32s)]
*  allowing the private sector to take part but this is unfortunately obstructed [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2827.2s)]
*  why it is obstructed weak governance lack of transparency poor competition [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2831.8799999999997s)]
*  and poor competition adding another factor that's a heavy presence of the [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2837.64s)]
*  state in the economy and here's a military in the economy which has [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2842.3199999999997s)]
*  significantly significantly increased under President Sisi providing tender by [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2846.0s)]
*  direct order to the military without any kind of competition and this is actually [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2851.8399999999997s)]
*  hurt the basic of liberal economies that's propagated by United States today [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2856.6s)]
*  and it will work against the interest of private sectors that we want to [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2861.48s)]
*  flourish in Egypt in order to provide employment and opportunity for Egyptian [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2866.44s)]
*  people these aren't really important points and by the way I'm gonna get to [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2870.96s)]
*  the audience next so just start to think of what questions you have quickly [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2874.2799999999997s)]
*  before we do that I want to ask both you and Michelle's point about the Israeli [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2878.36s)]
*  Palestinian peace process such as it is or lack thereof how much do you think [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2886.04s)]
*  that is a factor if Prime Minister Netanyahu is re-elected tomorrow do you [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2890.36s)]
*  foresee there being any rift between Egypt and the issue and the Golan [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2897.32s)]
*  Heights will will it will it even come up in the meeting with President Trump [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2906.8s)]
*  I'll yield my time to my answer is simple to that for a long time the [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2911.8s)]
*  Palestinian Israeli conflict has been used to blackmail Western government [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2921.0s)]
*  this is something really clear and President Sisi knows very well that his [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2925.1600000000003s)]
*  involvement in this will help him also to maintain his power and to pass certain [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2929.4s)]
*  you know concessions from to get certain concession from Western actors I think [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2934.5600000000004s)]
*  today Palestinians are under very tough choices there is divide in inside the [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2940.32s)]
*  Palestinian Authority repression has turned it actually and practice by [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2945.5600000000004s)]
*  Palestinian faction against Palestinian activists not just Israeli against [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2950.8s)]
*  Palestinian as a whole regional dynamics today is very hard when it comes to the [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2955.48s)]
*  peaceful and durable solution for the Arab Israeli conflict we have seen in [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2961.1200000000003s)]
*  the last Arab summit in Tunisia well there was some condemnation to Israeli [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2967.52s)]
*  policies in Palestinian occupied territory but what kind of mechanisms [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2973.0s)]
*  you have what kind of policies you have what kind of leverage that you can use [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2977.48s)]
*  to force and to pressure Israel to change its policies I think they have [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2980.84s)]
*  nothing to offer they are just concerned about their own domestic policies and [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2985.52s)]
*  the use Arab Israeli card in order to gain more and more time in their in [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2989.8s)]
*  power and also to blackmail Western government this is something clear I [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2995.24s)]
*  think but that's what's interesting perspective my perspective as an Egyptian [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=2999.2s)]
*  citizen and Egyptian activists who follow this situation inside Egypt I [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3003.6s)]
*  know maybe in United States it is different aspect of that but I'm just [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3007.52s)]
*  conveying the locals Egyptian respect yeah it's very interesting and I think a [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3010.7599999999998s)]
*  lot of people would agree with your analysis that's what's so interesting [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3015.8799999999997s)]
*  about the Trump administration though saying that it intends to proceed with [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3019.3199999999997s)]
*  potentially offering a peace plan we'll see right I mean they've been saying [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3023.24s)]
*  that for a long time but I find it your argument very interesting in that sense [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3027.0s)]
*  because it could finally force President Sisi and other Arab leaders to actually [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3032.04s)]
*  that tactic might not work for them anymore they actually would have to say [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3036.9599999999996s)]
*  whether they support this plan or not and what impassement actually there is [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3040.64s)]
*  the term dead to our leader a few days before their summit he just declared [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3044.3599999999997s)]
*  that Glenn you know he recognized Glenn's under Israeli sovereign and now [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3049.24s)]
*  President Sisi is coming to the White House right so that effectively he's [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3053.72s)]
*  recognizing defend himself did he put out any kind of a statement on the Golan [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3057.56s)]
*  they did put out a statement saying that they were against this you know as they [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3063.04s)]
*  did with the change on Jerusalem all right so let's bring in all of your [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3067.3999999999996s)]

*  Egyptian for a change my question is small question about two avenues simply [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3093.44s)]
*  the system to us Egyptian American or Egyptians the system is just a gun and [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3105.4s)]
*  people are imprisoned in this country there is no law it's only is a gun he [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3114.2000000000003s)]
*  can any any difference he can just put them in jail so any ability we can [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3119.8s)]
*  extract just a word a word from the administration from the State [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3125.64s)]
*  Department that any any concern just for the future because this situation is [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3133.04s)]
*  not sustainable so for just for your asset can you extract just a lip service [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3139.44s)]
*  just to let them know that this is not acceptable at least you have a minimum [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3146.24s)]
*  base of moral standards that's one thing the other thing is any way you can [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3151.36s)]
*  because the the this system is surviving because the lack not because the system [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3158.04s)]
*  is strong because of the lack of opposition the opposition is doesn't [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3165.64s)]

*  not organized no figure no skeleton the minute this opposition figure out a [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3173.88s)]
*  system or a skeleton or a structure this system is gone anyway for those who [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3181.16s)]
*  care about the the the future of Egypt to be changed peacefully we don't want [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3187.4s)]
*  to go into the route of radicals so anyway the or any action from us here [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3195.76s)]
*  as an American or American citizen whatever to help help those Egyptians [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3202.4s)]
*  because they don't know it looks so far they don't know how to structure a [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3209.0s)]
*  position okay thank you so I guess the question is what what can anyone do here [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3212.6800000000003s)]
*  that would actually be tangible and constructive well I just briefly I mean [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3217.16s)]
*  you know possibility of getting at least lip service from the White House on on [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3228.8399999999997s)]
*  on human rights or civic freedom issues it doesn't seem so it seems as though in [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3234.7999999999997s)]
*  this administration they came in with the idea that the Obama administration [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3242.44s)]
*  had been mistaken to be speaking up about human rights even though maybe they [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3246.6s)]
*  weren't that effective in doing anything about it but they were speaking up about [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3251.56s)]
*  human rights and that irritated the Egyptian government and so forth so the [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3254.64s)]
*  the from the beginning the the Trump administration said we're not going to [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3261.4s)]
*  do that I do think Congress speaks up and will will continue to to speak up [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3265.08s)]
*  regarding opposition and and what people can do and so forth I just want [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3271.68s)]
*  to take a moment to advertise I'm our Hamsa we and I have a new paper out [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3276.8799999999997s)]
*  about Egyptians in exile thanks Montez it's out there on the table and it talks [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3282.44s)]
*  about what people are doing and what it's what it says is that up to this [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3287.52s)]
*  point you're quite right there's been very little I mean the political [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3291.0s)]
*  opposition has really been crushed fragmented polarized and you know in [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3294.8799999999997s)]
*  many ways there are a lot of things that Egyptians are doing in exile where [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3301.0s)]
*  they have more freedom in the realms of human rights advocacy and also in the [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3306.68s)]
*  realm of media you know not all of it good but but there there's a lot of you [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3313.16s)]
*  know there's a lot of activity and that that activity I think is disturbing the [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3318.92s)]
*  Egyptian government that the Egyptian government is doing things to push back [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3323.88s)]
*  against this activity outside of the country as well which is [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3327.24s)]
*  maybe I can say something here I think there are two goal right now when it [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3332.8399999999997s)]
*  comes to rules of Egyptian outside because you know the growing number of [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3339.4799999999996s)]
*  activists who left is a country the first one is to to talk to each other [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3343.9599999999996s)]
*  first because really since 2011 there is a division that happened within the [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3349.72s)]
*  political society and civil society as well and it was further in 2013 so we [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3357.3399999999997s)]
*  need first to understand really to review what happened in Egypt and to [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3364.0s)]
*  learn from what happened and I think one of the major tasks right now is to how [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3368.68s)]
*  to transform human rights how to use human rights as a an agenda for this [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3374.96s)]
*  kind of common ground between different actors who working on each because I [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3381.64s)]
*  see now human rights is human rights issues today in Egypt is the thing is [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3385.96s)]
*  that every Egyptian I mean the political civil society international even [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3391.48s)]
*  international actors there is a consensus that now there is a catastrophe [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3395.64s)]
*  when it comes to human rights and this catastrophe will embed the transition in [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3399.44s)]
*  the future and it hurt the social fabric of Egyptian society so there is a rule [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3403.76s)]
*  on us as Egyptian human rights activists to think how to provide alternatives and [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3408.92s)]
*  how to think about detailed program when it comes to certain issues for example [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3415.5200000000004s)]
*  transitional justice dealing with the legacy of the successive authoritarian [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3420.2000000000003s)]
*  regime that Egypt has known so far the institutional and legal mess that my [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3425.6800000000003s)]
*  talked about because prison CCM in bed with the Egyptian institution and laws [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3431.68s)]
*  many things that really create disorder in the legal structure of an [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3436.7999999999997s)]
*  institutional structure of Egyptian state so these are hard issues and we [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3443.96s)]
*  are not inventing the wheel because in other models like in Chile or in [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3450.9199999999996s)]
*  Tunisia under under Ben Ali human rights defender in exile blade a rule in the [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3454.48s)]
*  talking to each other to discussing some of the briefing issues and one of the [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3460.16s)]
*  briefing issues issue issue today is the rule of civilian military relation what [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3465.56s)]
*  kind of chicken balance that should be built you know in any future transitions [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3470.92s)]
*  the relationship between state and religion because this is also created [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3476.2400000000002s)]
*  polarization in Egyptian society and it one of the factor that leads the [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3479.96s)]
*  or to be embedded in Egypt is a polarization caused by the religious [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3485.34s)]
*  lack of consensus on the role of religion and the state and guarantees [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3491.82s)]
*  needed to protect minority woman and all of them and that second goal for for [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3496.5s)]
*  for the work outside Egypt of course is mobilization mobilization targeting [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3501.7400000000002s)]
*  public opinion institution civil society working with trade unions in different [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3506.98s)]
*  countries like in Europe for example because they are very influential in [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3515.7s)]
*  Europe targeting business also because we are I think as human rights defender [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3518.42s)]
*  we have not done much work on that working with our targeting private [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3522.02s)]
*  companies that working with Egyptian government and trying also to persuade [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3528.62s)]
*  and convince them to consider human rights agenda in the relationship with [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3533.14s)]
*  Egypt I would add something just about the reason why the opposition is so [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3536.5s)]
*  fragmented certainly and there were a lot of challenges a lot of mistakes made [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3543.74s)]
*  but I think it's important to also realize the situation that we're dealing [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3548.14s)]
*  with we're dealing with the legal scheme that prohibits people from gathering [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3552.1s)]
*  even for a meeting for political parties that have tried to engage on the [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3555.46s)]
*  constitutional amendment issue like a dust or party had its members arrested [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3559.82s)]
*  outside of a meeting that was in a private space and so I think it's [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3563.94s)]
*  important to keep that in mind not as an excuse but also to understand the [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3568.1s)]
*  reality to know that there's systematically laws and practices that [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3571.78s)]
*  are making it so that there is no opposition and I think that underscores [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3575.94s)]
*  actually why one of the reasons why these constitutional amendments are so [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3579.82s)]
*  important and so impactful because they eliminate any space for that opposition [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3583.54s)]
*  so it becomes so much easier for in our meetings the u.s. to ask us so if not [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3589.02s)]
*  CC then what's the alternative and really it's impossible to answer that [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3593.7s)]
*  question when we're in this context and when the u.s. is sending these implicit [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3597.5s)]
*  messages of support I would say okay right thank all of you thank you to all [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3602.22s)]
*  of you for your presentations I'm Amy Austin homes I teach at the American [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3611.3799999999997s)]
*  University in Cairo and I'm also here at the Wilson Center now this year my cry [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3616.74s)]
*  I have one question but there are there's an Egyptian the European and an [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3622.3s)]
*  American angle to it so basically as all of you know when Tillerson first came [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3625.9s)]
*  into office it wasn't actually clear that he would take a stand on you know [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3633.38s)]
*  human rights in Egypt but he did that he did actually withhold some of the US [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3637.78s)]
*  military aid to each of her he made it conditional for a certain amount of time [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3642.3s)]
*  so do you see any possibility that Pompeo for example could change his [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3645.6200000000003s)]
*  position and I'm mentioning this because when he spoke at the American University [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3651.7000000000003s)]
*  in Cairo recently when he gave his speech there he didn't actually mention [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3656.6600000000003s)]
*  Julia Jenny for example a single time although when he was in Saudi Arabia he [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3662.9s)]
*  did mention the murder of Jamal Khashoggi so is this because there has [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3667.42s)]
*  been a lack of coordination between and this gets to the European dimension of [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3672.38s)]
*  it has there been a lack of coordination between those of us here in the United [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3676.6600000000003s)]
*  States and for example in Europe on these issues because in Europe the issue [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3681.1s)]
*  Julie Jenny has been a very big issue I mean his his parents are still pushing [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3685.42s)]
*  for some accountability so is there a lack of coordination between Europe and [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3689.58s)]
*  the United States on these issues that might be the reason why Pompeo didn't [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3694.1s)]
*  mention in his speech and finally you know all of this as I'm sure you know [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3697.2599999999998s)]
*  there was a lot of anger at the American University in Cairo because of his speech [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3704.58s)]
*  but also the fact that it was done in a very sort of secretive way and then it [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3708.94s)]
*  was presented as an example of how this is freedom of speech etc and I don't [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3712.06s)]
*  want to go into the details of the university politics behind that but you [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3716.7000000000003s)]
*  know it gets to the issue of academic freedom and freedom of expression and [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3722.58s)]
*  also the issue of economic development in Egypt because the government itself [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3726.98s)]
*  realizes that they need to improve the educational system in Egypt and they [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3731.14s)]
*  actually realize that they need to attract foreign universities to come [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3736.34s)]
*  and establish either branch campuses in Egypt or to somehow expand the [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3740.3s)]
*  educational offerings in Egypt but that's not happening because universities [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3745.58s)]
*  are afraid to come to Egypt so is there any recognition and this is the final [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3750.3s)]
*  part of the question is there any recognition in Egypt that you can see [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3755.6600000000003s)]
*  their own policies are prohibiting regarding the crackdown on academic [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3760.1s)]
*  freedom and journalists etc and everyone basically but that those policies are [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3766.7799999999997s)]
*  prohibiting their economic goals of you know educating their population so that [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3771.5s)]
*  they can achieve economic development etc is there any recognition that you see [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3776.8199999999997s)]
*  that that their own policies are counterproductive in terms of what they [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3780.1s)]
*  hope to achieve for their own economic development well thank you that's very [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3784.62s)]
*  interesting set of questions I you know we might not be able to get to all of [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3787.74s)]
*  them but just quickly were you were you at the speech and what was your [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3791.2599999999998s)]
*  impression of it you were here okay so it's affecting your your world and your [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3794.58s)]
*  colleagues but just something on the universities in UK Egyptian ambassador [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3801.58s)]
*  in UK offered University of Liverpool to open my branch in Egypt and they [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3811.18s)]
*  evaluated the situation fused to go to Egypt foreign academics also there are [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3816.7s)]
*  instructions not to do any field research in Egypt so it's also [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3822.3399999999997s)]
*  catastrophic on it education and development of education in the country [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3826.8199999999997s)]
*  well how the situation will it change I think now we have evidence just a few [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3831.46s)]
*  days ago evidence in terms of the impact of misled counter-terrorism policies in [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3837.3799999999997s)]

*  fact have been said by human-right organization since long time but Reuters [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3860.7799999999997s)]
*  additional evidence of how the Western weapons have been used against civilians [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3867.3s)]
*  methods in Egypt I remind you five citizens were killed when you because [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3874.54s)]
*  you mentioned Julie regime five citizens were killed in July 2016 in middle of [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3880.1000000000004s)]
*  2016 and the police at that time said that because they are the perpetrator of [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3886.1000000000004s)]
*  the killing of Julie regime those five Egyptian innocent citizen where is their [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3891.5s)]
*  right you know these people were assassinated by more and more in early [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3897.02s)]
*  2017 we saw the leaks that have been you know broadcast on YouTube on execution [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3901.46s)]
*  of hostage in Sinai and today's is evidence coming from Reuters so I think [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3908.54s)]
*  there is evidence from the ground what we like is a political well of Western [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3913.62s)]
*  Europe Europe is divided today with all of the growing right wing is a Brexit [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3918.94s)]
*  debate in UK the EU unfortunately continue providing support to debate [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3924.1s)]
*  within the institution not to release new fund to Egyptian government because [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3931.1800000000003s)]
*  of these reasons that we are talking about but there is a lack of political [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3935.38s)]
*  leadership has been always follows a US when it comes to Egypt if things change [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3939.1800000000003s)]
*  it here in Washington Europe will follow and this happened under Mubarak and the [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3945.62s)]
*  2000 yeah following the cook yeah no that's it I quickly because I want to [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3949.06s)]
*  make sure we get a few more questions but Michelle that's the the sort of [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3952.74s)]
*  follow-up I would ask you is what if this is not an omission on the part of [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3956.1s)]
*  the US government but this is the policy I mean you know it seems fairly clear in [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3960.62s)]
*  fact at this point that had the administration wanted to speak more [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3965.3399999999997s)]
*  publicly about these issues it would have absolutely it's not a lack of [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3967.94s)]
*  communication you know from the beginning of the Trump administration [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3971.54s)]
*  they didn't want to speak publicly about issues but as you know as was [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3974.42s)]
*  asked you know secretary Tillerson did engage a little bit more now he it's [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3982.1s)]
*  interesting he engaged on these NGO issues on the NGO case and the NGO law [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3987.98s)]
*  and those are just briefly really interesting to look at right now so in [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3993.62s)]
*  the case of the 43 people convicted in 2013 the the Trump administration got [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=3996.94s)]
*  what it wanted eventually I mean it had to sort of really you know keep the [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4004.38s)]
*  pressure up and had been begun begun earlier under the Obama administration [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4009.1800000000003s)]
*  but eventually all those people were acquitted in December of last year now [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4013.1800000000003s)]
*  we have the issue of the NGO law which was secretary Tillerson made very much [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4018.1400000000003s)]
*  an issue of this this very draconian new NGO law and just before CC arrives in [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4024.1800000000003s)]
*  town there's this announcement from the from one of the ministers in the [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4031.12s)]
*  Egyptian government that they're going to abrogate the law and put a new law in [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4035.48s)]
*  place of course I think that's really it's just a tactic to get the issue off [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4038.64s)]
*  the table for CC's visit you know what will actually happen with that law we [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4042.8399999999997s)]
*  have yet to see they have not abrogated the old law yet the new law is not out [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4047.96s)]
*  and you know unfortunately if past experience is a guide these things often [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4052.16s)]
*  disappoint further down the line but what you see that they felt they had to [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4056.72s)]
*  sort of well let's try to let's try to close off the loop on that one I just [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4061.6s)]
*  wanted to make one more comment about and there is a difference in Secretary [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4065.9599999999996s)]
*  Pompeo we can see a clear difference I mean Secretary Tillerson his views were [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4069.8399999999997s)]
*  you know they were kind of in a way more traditional Republican Party views on [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4074.68s)]
*  foreign policy he was obviously a bit of an you know didn't fit that [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4080.0s)]
*  comfortably inside the Trump administration and and and left Secretary [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4085.1s)]
*  Pompeo I think seems to be much more have much more of an affinity with [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4090.2999999999997s)]
*  President Trump in terms of his his views on these issues and we're seeing [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4095.14s)]
*  that with the treatment of Egypt one last point on this point about academic [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4099.5s)]
*  freedom and so forth the lack of academic freedom the lack of freedom in [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4104.1s)]
*  the media and so forth this all has an economic effect as well and it's it's [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4109.1s)]
*  not only universities who don't want to come it's foreign direct investment all [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4114.82s)]
*  these things are linked right in the Mubarak and minister Mubarak and they [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4119.139999999999s)]
*  you know Mubarak era they understood this and there was a bit of a loosening [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4126.0599999999995s)]
*  up on media on civil society they allowed internet freedom and things like [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4130.179999999999s)]
*  that because they wanted to attract foreign direct investment not because [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4135.66s)]
*  they were Democrats and and and it was all seen as part of the same picture CC [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4139.5s)]
*  now comes in and says well that was Mubarak's mistake he loosened up too [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4145.68s)]
*  much and then we had the you know 2011 revolution so I'm not gonna make that [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4150.22s)]
*  mistake but he is having a problem if you read those IMF reports closely yes [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4154.98s)]
*  they always start out with we're so happy with all the austerity measures [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4160.46s)]
*  but you read down a little bit and Montez was quoting from a recent one and [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4163.7s)]
*  you see the concerns about you know investment is not flowing into Egypt [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4168.02s)]
*  which which they had hoped it would do on the back of austerity measures [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4174.1s)]
*  because it's not a free environment it's not a level playing field state [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4177.9800000000005s)]
*  companies military companies are far too dominant it's not a competitive [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4183.9400000000005s)]
*  environment or an open environment and so you know eventually you know that [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4188.3s)]
*  that is gonna catch up with the CC government I want to make sure that we [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4193.26s)]
*  get to a couple questions so I think we'll just take maybe two questions now [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4197.86s)]
*  and then have our panels come back for a final round so we'll go to you sir and [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4202.74s)]
*  then you hello Greg after and alien with Boston University just interpreting [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4206.58s)]
*  some of these constitutional amendments I'm curious if this was one way for CC to [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4213.94s)]
*  preclude a military coup in other words he's giving the military much more power [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4220.08s)]
*  and over the in the last presidential election you know we saw him arrest or [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4225.14s)]
*  force people who announced they wanted to run for president with a military [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4232.54s)]
*  background to basically step down and so I'm wondering is he trying to protect [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4237.42s)]
*  himself against a possible coup down the road since he you know came to power of [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4243.860000000001s)]
*  course that way thank you and then right here in the front [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4249.58s)]
*  thank you actually my question was quite the same with the previous one I am a [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4255.14s)]
*  circle from set a DC and my question was about a potential military coup against [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4263.38s)]
*  CC I am aware of that the relations between the military and the president [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4268.9800000000005s)]
*  is very complicated in Egypt considering that I want to ask are they [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4275.900000000001s)]
*  inseparable the CC and military is inseparable and under what conditions [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4280.58s)]
*  the military can make an actions against CC thank you well why don't we I think [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4285.3s)]
*  as a lawyer I'm not in the business of guessing and sort of and anticipating [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4298.42s)]
*  exactly what's gonna happen and I don't think it's a good business with Egypt [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4303.98s)]
*  anyway because we're always surprised but I think it is it's very true what you [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4307.1s)]
*  say the relationship between president CC and the military is complicated as [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4312.06s)]
*  has been talked about before he comes from an intelligence background there is [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4315.9400000000005s)]
*  a lack of distrust that comes as part of that community in general it's something [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4320.34s)]
*  that plays into the relationship it's something that can't be ignored I've [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4325.54s)]
*  heard multiple explanations for why that specific amendment is in the [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4330.06s)]
*  which have implied that it is sort of a carrot in order to keep the balance of [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4335.02s)]
*  powers and others have taken a completely different perspective which [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4338.860000000001s)]
*  this is something that's been handed down and said this must be part of the [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4342.26s)]
*  package so I'll leave it at that I won't I won't stipulate us to which one it is [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4345.620000000001s)]
*  but I think with regards to closing remarks I think it's important for us [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4350.38s)]
*  sometimes it's hard to talk about things like constitutional amendments they're [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4354.34s)]
*  technical they're very complicated there they're they affect the nature of the [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4358.14s)]
*  state in a way that maybe is less easy to talk about than the arrest of one [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4362.62s)]
*  individual or an American citizen in detention but I think it's important to [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4366.0199999999995s)]
*  keep in mind that these amendments change the way the Egyptian state will [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4369.9s)]
*  be that change is beginning it has begun already it's big it's escalating now and [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4373.82s)]
*  it will continue and I think if you want to see what Egypt is going to look like [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4378.82s)]
*  down the line at 2034 one only need look at the way the institutions are [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4382.78s)]
*  deteriorating a judiciary that is losing its independence increasingly so [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4387.9s)]
*  alongside its prosecution a legislature that has unfortunately become a rubber [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4392.14s)]
*  stamp for a lot of executive actions in fact the vast majority of laws passed by [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4397.3s)]
*  the Parliament which we track in our Egypt Parliament Watch project are [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4403.06s)]
*  initiated by the executive so they're not even initiated by MPs raising [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4406.740000000001s)]
*  questions on legal stability and sort of legal independence as well and just the [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4411.660000000001s)]
*  way the the government views its citizens I think it's very instructive [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4415.900000000001s)]
*  to see how little tolerance there has been from this government with regards to [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4419.7s)]
*  just a no vote or even a boycott of the vote we've seen people arrested in one [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4424.34s)]
*  week alone there were 70 individuals arrested in the aftermath of the train [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4429.54s)]
*  crash and expressing dissatisfaction around the constitutional amendments [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4433.98s)]
*  among them like I said an American citizen a trans woman a trans man a [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4437.74s)]
*  really worrying development and I would say it's it's [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4441.9s)]
*  instructive to sort of think I'll end with this think about the case of the [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4446.22s)]
*  man who took to Tahrir holding up a sign saying leave Sisi and he was [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4449.860000000001s)]
*  arrested and now he's in or he would forcibly disappeared for a period and [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4456.02s)]
*  now is in pretrial detention so that gives you a window of what what we're [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4459.9400000000005s)]
*  working with and what we can expect in the future thank you so much what has [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4464.42s)]
*  you want to take the military as well as something with that well actions that [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4469.66s)]
*  have been taken by President Sisi over the past two years indicate from within [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4475.62s)]
*  the regime structure I mean what military two figures and another military [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4483.98s)]
*  officer who you know tried to compete him in the election and also decision and [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4494.18s)]
*  reshuffle that has been followed within as a general intelligence and the army [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4501.46s)]
*  and the military intelligence it's clear that he tried force to put things under [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4506.74s)]
*  under control he succeeded or not so far not answer this but it seems to me that [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4511.06s)]
*  there is discomfort from within the regime and all of this decision indicate [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4518.18s)]
*  what he tried to do is to build this patronage system of patronage to assure [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4524.14s)]
*  his own stability in the business landscape in the media landscape and [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4529.26s)]
*  also within the Parliament the military intelligence playing role in choosing [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4535.46s)]
*  MBs and making party list we saw the first parliamentary election and this [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4541.58s)]
*  something new in Egypt as well that you know you give this direct rule to the [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4546.62s)]
*  military intelligence and general intelligence to device you know who is [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4553.26s)]
*  competing and how which what kind of political parties will establish and [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4557.7s)]
*  what kind of political parties will be you know sidelined so this is what he [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4561.3s)]
*  what he's doing and also the media landscape and creating also new elite [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4565.58s)]
*  of businessmen also coming from background to build them to maintain [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4571.26s)]
*  this patronage and I think the constitutional amendment will maintain [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4575.82s)]
*  that and we try also to give stability for this kind of network of [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4579.78s)]
*  interest to establish around the president and I think also having a [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4587.38s)]
*  second chamber of the Parliament it's also within this direction to give more [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4592.7s)]
*  pride for more supporters and to give them role in the institution in order to [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4598.22s)]
*  support you know the ruling institution but I don't he does what he want and [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4603.22s)]
*  this is the homework of any repressive regime to create this kind of [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4609.42s)]
*  institution but as an activist I think he will not succeed because what what we [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4613.06s)]
*  are seeing today in Egypt in term of demography this is what I said in my [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4619.46s)]
*  introductory remark the demography demographic challenge economic social [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4623.46s)]
*  challenge and they don't think that he will be able to deliver economically and [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4627.860000000001s)]
*  socially because Egyptian economy [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4631.9800000000005s)]
*  many of them related built in in the Egyptian system but also the neighborhood [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4636.46s)]
*  the regional factors so he will not be able to deliver socially and economically [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4640.82s)]
*  in term of demographic challenge the younger people are alienated and they [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4645.78s)]
*  will not be also will not concede you know easily and they will continue [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4650.179999999999s)]
*  challenging the but what concerning me as an Egyptian citizen [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4654.98s)]
*  avoiding the society from alternative and replacing all political actors and [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4659.58s)]
*  civil society actors in the country despite the fact that there is growing [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4665.46s)]
*  resistance and it will grow I think this also can take Egypt into [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4669.14s)]
*  instability if there is no process of opening up the space because and we have [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4675.06s)]
*  seen that in many countries following the Arab Spring and I think this is a [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4681.54s)]
*  challenge that is Egypt today Egypt cannot be continue like that and this [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4685.26s)]
*  something that make any Egyptian worry about the future of the country about the [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4691.5s)]
*  social cohesion of the Egyptian society thank you so much Michelle the last word [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4695.46s)]
*  goes to you what has has has framed this in a very provocative way and said that [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4701.78s)]
*  essentially a totalitarian state is is being formed before our eyes you know I [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4706.06s)]
*  don't know how you assess the situation right now but maybe you can can leave [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4711.7s)]
*  us with a thought about you know the significance of this particular visit by [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4717.86s)]
*  the president of Egypt to the president I'd say it's at this moment yeah I you [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4722.46s)]
*  know I agree with what ma says has said about the the signs that they're you [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4726.34s)]
*  know and and there always are inside these kind of regimes problems and that [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4731.74s)]
*  may mentioned sort of carrots and sticks we see CC using economic benefits to the [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4735.86s)]
*  military at the same time maybe using possibility of corruption proceedings or [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4742.34s)]
*  this special law that allows him to designate whether or not members of the [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4747.1s)]
*  military can be pursued for some of their human rights crimes and so forth [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4751.74s)]
*  so you're trying to control things whether he will or will not control [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4757.5s)]
*  things over the longer run is another question but certainly regarding this [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4762.66s)]
*  visit I do think that you know as we said that the timing of this visit makes [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4766.9s)]
*  it very valuable to President CC to put across these constitutional amendments [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4772.58s)]
*  I mean it's a message to the Egyptian people but maybe even more so to to the [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4777.54s)]
*  Egyptian military and to the major figures there that you know CC has the [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4783.14s)]
*  United States in his pocket and you know it's really it's really too bad to see [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4787.34s)]
*  the United States playing that role on the level of principle but even if we [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4793.42s)]
*  were to set aside that if we look back at what for example the previous [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4798.78s)]
*  administration did you know the Obama administration was blamed by the [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4804.66s)]
*  Egyptian public at the beginning of the 2011 uprising for being too close to [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4809.139999999999s)]
*  Mubarak too close to the old regime then after Morsi was elected well they were [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4815.98s)]
*  too close to Morsi they were seen as being you know in league with the Muslim [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4820.86s)]
*  Brotherhood and why does the Trump administration want to make that same [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4825.3s)]
*  They're over investing in CC himself as opposed to having a good relationship [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4831.14s)]
*  sort of with the nation of Egypt with the people of Egypt by pushing you know [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4837.820000000001s)]
*  everything into the realm of security cooperation security assistance it's all [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4842.02s)]
*  about the US relationship now is you know primarily with the military and [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4847.46s)]
*  with CC as opposed to with the nation of Egypt more broadly and I think that'll [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4852.02s)]
*  come back to haunt them all right on that note we can reconvene and see see [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4857.34s)]
*  where we end up I want to thank everyone here for great questions and in [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4863.1s)]
*  particular thing this great group of panelists I've really learned a lot [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVJ3pQVjFY&t=4866.78s)]
