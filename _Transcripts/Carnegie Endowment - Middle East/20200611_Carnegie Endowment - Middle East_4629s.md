# Egypt Faces the Pandemic: Health and Economic Effects
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [June 11, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8)
*  Hello, everyone. I'm Michelle Dunn. I'm director of the Middle East program at the Carnegie [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=0.0s)]
*  Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. I'd like to welcome you. Thank you for [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=16.12s)]
*  joining us for this discussion on Egypt Faces the Pandemic. Today's session is going to [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=22.56s)]
*  focus on the health and economic challenges of the pandemic for Egypt. We're going to [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=29.36s)]
*  have a discussion of about 30 or 40 minutes, and after that, we'll have time for your questions. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=35.92s)]
*  So please go ahead throughout the discussion and submit your questions in the YouTube chat, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=41.28s)]
*  and I will select from there and pose questions to the panelists. This is part of a three-part [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=47.0s)]
*  series. This is the first in three short seminars. Today's session, as I mentioned, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=53.32s)]
*  focuses on the health and economic effects of the pandemic. The second session, which will be one [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  week from today, will focus on the political, rights, and global challenges for Egypt of the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=65.48s)]
*  pandemic. And the third session, which will be on Thursday, June 25th, is how the pandemic will [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=72.52000000000001s)]
*  affect Egypt's ability to address enduring challenges, among them population growth, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=79.96s)]
*  Nile water, and marginalized regions and communities inside of Egypt. So we hope you'll [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=87.0s)]
*  join us for all of those sessions. Today, we have a wonderful panel to address the health and economic [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=93.55999999999999s)]
*  effects of the pandemic. We have with us Ayman Saba, who is CEO of Shemsiah, an NGO focusing on [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=100.6s)]
*  community-based health solutions. He's also a specialist on health rights at the Egyptian [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=108.44s)]
*  Initiative for Personal Rights in Cairo. We have with us Amy Akhdali, who co-directs the Arab Watch [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=114.52s)]
*  Coalition and who has worked for more than 15 years in civil society monitoring of international [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=121.8s)]
*  financial institutions. And we have Tim Caldas, who's an independent risk advisor and a non-resident [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=128.68s)]
*  fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy. Again, after our discussion, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=135.96s)]
*  we'll turn to the audience for questions, so please go ahead and submit your questions in writing [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=142.68s)]
*  in the YouTube chat function. So I want to start with the health aspects of the pandemic. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=149.4s)]
*  And I'd like to start with some questions to you, Ayman. An Egyptian health ministry [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=157.0s)]
*  official predicted this week that daily infections in Egypt could rise over the next month or so, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=162.44s)]
*  from the current level of something like between 1,300 and 1,500 infections a day to 2,000 or even [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=169.88s)]
*  2,500 new infections daily. So where do you see Egypt in facing this health crisis? Is Egypt [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=177.64s)]
*  approaching the peak of infections, at least for the first wave of the pandemic? Has it already [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=186.76s)]
*  passed it, or where do you think Egypt is? Thank you very much for this important question to [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=191.48s)]
*  start with. So let me first be very clear that any projections or any predictions done by the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  government in the current context are based on the numbers that are supplied by the Ministry of Health. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=207.16s)]
*  These numbers rely on the sources of collection of these numbers are really the central lab in [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=213.56s)]
*  terms of the number of tests, how many of these tests are positive and such. And in the end, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=221.8s)]
*  even in the statements and even in the press conferences organized by or provided by the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=227.8s)]
*  Ministry of Higher Education, it was very clear that any of the numbers that are given do not [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=233.72s)]
*  necessarily reflect the reality. And this is why they have different scenarios where they account [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=240.44000000000003s)]
*  for the actual numbers of positive cases to be from five to even seven times the numbers actually [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=246.76000000000002s)]
*  provided by the government. So whenever we are dealing with these figures provided by the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=253.96s)]
*  government, we should be very cautious. It's not that the government has different numbers that [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=259.88s)]
*  they are hiding, but these are the actual numbers available to them within the available tools for [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=264.92s)]
*  them to collect data. When we put into consideration the number of people who get infected and do not [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=270.92s)]
*  report or do not manage to report for whatever reason, for stigma, for fear that they're going [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=277.64000000000004s)]
*  to be receiving services in a place that may actually infect them, or because they simply [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=284.04s)]
*  don't want to give the data to the government. In the end, when we are dealing with this, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=288.68s)]
*  we are fully aware that these do not represent the actual numbers of the infections. That said, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=294.28s)]
*  I believe that we are approaching the peak of the infection. So far, the predictions of the government [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=301.64s)]
*  have been more or less accurate, again, based on the numbers that they are actually collecting. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=310.35999999999996s)]
*  And so far, the health care system has been relatively resilient to the situation. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=317.08000000000004s)]
*  That said, we were actually blessed by a relatively slow curve of the infections. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=324.92s)]
*  This curve should have enabled us to actually be ready for the current moment, and it should have [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=332.76s)]
*  enabled us as a country with a system that is liable to collapse from such a pandemic, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=340.76s)]
*  to be more ready in terms of operations, in terms of information and management of the cases and [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=349.08s)]
*  distribution among the hospitals. And this is where the main problem is. Are we nearing the peak? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=354.84000000000003s)]
*  I would definitely hope so. I believe we are. So far, the predictions were relatively accurate, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=363.08s)]
*  but will we be able to maintain this with the least amount of unnecessary deaths? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=371.4s)]
*  And while ensuring that our health care system doesn't collapse, this is really the challenge [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=376.28s)]
*  that we need to identify and to address. So let me ask you more about that, about the ability of [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=381.56s)]
*  the health system. You said the health system has coped reasonably well so far, but if these [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=389.16s)]
*  predictions are right, I mean, if you would be looking at perhaps a 50% rise in the number of [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=396.92s)]
*  cases coming in on a daily basis over the next month, do you think the health system will be [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=403.0s)]
*  able to cope with that as well? Well, so far, in terms of hospitals and their capacities and [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=408.76000000000005s)]
*  number of beds and ventilators, we have not reached a saturated system yet. So far, we are [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=416.68s)]
*  not providing services that are optimal. This is why the utilization of these services is not [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=425.88s)]
*  necessarily in the best way. Many people don't reach, don't go to the health care facilities [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=433.88s)]
*  simply because they don't trust in the system that is providing these services. So till now, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=438.84000000000003s)]
*  we didn't reach the saturation. That said, we still are confronted with cases that go to hospitals [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=443.96s)]
*  and who are refused either testing or admission, not because they don't have enough beds, but [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=451.4s)]
*  because they are not managed properly. They're not distributed properly. They are not directed [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=457.47999999999996s)]
*  to the places where they will actually find the needed beds and the needed tests. And this is [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=461.88s)]
*  really where the problem is. I do not believe that we lack hospital beds or ventilators as much as we [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=467.24s)]
*  lack the system and the operations that can manage such a system. The health care system and [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=473.88s)]
*  the government has been pretty competent in managing the situation at the very beginning [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=479.96s)]
*  because it was contained, because the minister could have a daily meeting with the limited [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=484.28s)]
*  number of isolation hospital that it has, and it could actually manage the case and be in [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=489.88s)]
*  direct communication. Now that cases are being directed to over 300 hospitals around the country, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=494.44s)]
*  now that different health care facilities are providing different kinds of services, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=501.64s)]
*  they definitely do not have this sufficient control that should have been in place. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=506.68s)]
*  So, you know, one thing we've been seeing is a bit of public tension between medical professionals, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=514.28s)]
*  for example, the physician syndicate and government health officials. How do you [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=524.1999999999999s)]
*  understand that? What's the nature of this tension and what does it tell us? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=530.36s)]
*  For me, this is primarily lack of governance and stakeholder inclusion. The main criticism [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=541.24s)]
*  that as civil society we have been providing to the government in the past couple of months [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=549.08s)]
*  was not related to how they're managing the situation or the measures that they're taking. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=554.6800000000001s)]
*  It was because they still do not believe in the importance of social accountability, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=558.12s)]
*  of including all of the relevant stakeholders. So, doctors in that case and medical professionals [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=564.84s)]
*  are the core of the service that is being provided. And if we are managing such a situation [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=571.16s)]
*  without having a body that includes all of the different stakeholders, listens to them, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=576.28s)]
*  and accounts to their needs and to the restrictions they have in the design, it is bound to [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=582.12s)]
*  have conflicts. This is why just a couple of days ago the Chamber of Private Service Providers [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=588.44s)]
*  decided to announce that they are going to refuse to receive any services, to receive any patients, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=594.12s)]
*  to provide them with services related to corona infections because the government decided to [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=601.24s)]
*  impose on them a mandatory pricing that is making them lose from this equation. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=609.48s)]
*  This could have been prevented by an early inclusion of these stakeholders in the equation. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=614.84s)]
*  Doctors and their needs are very simple. They do not require negotiations. They do not require to [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=620.6s)]
*  be dealt with as an emergency or as a crisis. We have been blessed by a slow curve. So, this is [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=626.6800000000001s)]
*  really the main problem. The government has done a tremendous job in containing the situation and [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=633.8000000000001s)]
*  containing the pandemic at the beginning. It could have dealt with such a thing in an even better [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=639.0s)]
*  way if it had included the entire society. NGOs, private sector, doctors, all of the different [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=644.68s)]
*  stakeholders, they could have had a say and they could have easily made the transition from [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=651.88s)]
*  different phases of the pandemic much smoother. We're still there. We can still contain this by [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=657.4799999999999s)]
*  driving and by pushing for more accountability and the better governance of the decision-making [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=666.28s)]
*  process. The prime minister announced around a month ago that he wanted to reinstate the [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=673.88s)]
*  higher health council, which is an accountability body that was designed to do this job but has never [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=680.52s)]
*  been entering into operations. I think this is the perfect time for this and we are heavily [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=685.9599999999999s)]
*  advocating for this because this is really the only way we are going to get through this as a [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=691.56s)]
*  society, not just as a government. Thanks, Aiman. I'm sure we'll get back to more about the health [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=695.64s)]
*  aspects in the discussion, but I'd like to turn now to the economy. As we discuss the economy, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=702.68s)]
*  I hope we'll be able to cover both the macro picture and the real economy, how it affects [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=711.7199999999999s)]
*  people. It does seem that there's a global economic recession related to this pandemic [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=719.08s)]
*  and it's affecting Egypt just like every place else. I'd like to start with you, Tim. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=726.5200000000001s)]
*  As Aiman said, Egypt may be approaching the peak of the infections, at least for the first [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=736.36s)]
*  global wave of this coronavirus, but we still don't know how bad it will get. What about the [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=744.44s)]
*  economy? It seems that just as infections are peaking in Egypt, Egypt is also starting to [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=750.6s)]
*  reopen for economic reasons. Do you feel like you have a sense already of how hard an economic [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=758.0400000000001s)]
*  hit Egypt will take from this global crisis or will it be a long time before we know? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=767.64s)]
*  I think, thank you, Michelle, and thank you all for being here. I think that we have an idea [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=776.12s)]
*  so far what the accumulated effect is, but we can't reasonably or accurately predict [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=783.64s)]
*  the ultimate impact because we don't really know how long this will go. Egypt's economy is not [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=790.28s)]
*  isolated, so even with the slow curve, as Aiman mentioned, the global downturn that has [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=796.92s)]
*  been precipitated by this pandemic will affect various elements of Egypt's economy from global [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=803.64s)]
*  trade to energy prices to remittances. Egypt has a lot of external vulnerabilities that are taking [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=809.88s)]
*  a hit due to the struggle that the entire world is dealing with. That coupled with [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=818.12s)]
*  a fairly fragile economic structure that's been built up over the years that's dependent on a [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=826.92s)]
*  handful of pillars and a fairly weak and not terribly diversified private sector, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=834.52s)]
*  but more weak than less diversified, has made it even harder, I think, to cope with this. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=840.68s)]
*  Then on the real level, the infrastructure for providing social support to the public in terms [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=847.56s)]
*  of means-tested cash transfers, in terms of other direct forms of assistance, is still not [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=854.36s)]
*  sufficiently developed. For example, when the government offered payments to workers in the [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=860.04s)]
*  informal sector, they reached a little over 10% of them, which is such a huge part of the economy, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=866.04s)]
*  and they don't have even the records of who they would be giving the money to. A lot of the people [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=874.76s)]
*  in that sector complained that they didn't even know how to get the money or that they were [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=881.0s)]
*  eligible for it. All these things intensify the need on the part of workers to go out every day [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=884.6s)]
*  and seek any sort of pay that they can secure and limits their ability to shelter in place and [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=892.6s)]
*  follow the guidelines that the state has placed to deter the transmission of the disease. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=899.0s)]
*  There's a lot of structural problems that became more apparent as a result of this and have [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=904.36s)]
*  exacerbated the economic losses that will come as a result of it as well. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=911.16s)]
*  So, Tim, you just mentioned that the Egyptian economy sort of rests on a small number of pillars. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=916.68s)]
*  So I'll just note that in addition, of course, to the general slowdown of everyday economic activity [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=923.16s)]
*  as people are forced to stay home, these major sources of foreign exchange for Egypt, Suez Canal [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=933.72s)]
*  revenues, remittances from abroad, tourism, gas exports, they're all down and they all might be [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=940.36s)]
*  down for some time. And it also seems that the central bank is again supporting the currency to [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=949.08s)]
*  try to avoid another real drop in the value of the pound. How do you see this picture? How long [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=958.28s)]
*  do you expect all these things to go on? Am I missing other factors that are key to how this [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=966.4399999999999s)]
*  is going to affect the Egyptian economy? No, I agree with you. As early as March, I was noting [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=973.3199999999999s)]
*  that virtually every single source of dollars that Egypt depends on is going down. And I don't see [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=979.16s)]
*  a number of those will be that way for quite some time. Tourism is not going to recover quickly. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=987.48s)]
*  Global trade is I don't think is going to recover that quickly. Remittances are going to be a long [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=993.0799999999999s)]
*  term problem as people are leaving the Gulf at the moment. We don't have a good breakdown [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=997.72s)]
*  by nationality of how many people are leaving. But Bloomberg ran a piece recently saying that [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1003.72s)]
*  as many as 900,000 jobs in the Emirates might be lost. Repatriation from Qatar is happening. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1008.04s)]
*  We're seeing a lot of people leave. And that's remittances for Egypt was 9% of the GDP of the [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1013.88s)]
*  country last year. It's worth an enormous amount of money for the country. And it's also crucial [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1019.96s)]
*  to support so many families in the country who have been struggling to deal with years of punishing [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1026.68s)]
*  inflation and austerity. So a significant drop in that revenue is going to affect a lot of [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1032.2s)]
*  individual families significantly. But I think that what we also need is, as I've been pointing [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1041.24s)]
*  out in the health sector, we need more inclusivity. We need a much more inclusive reform policy and [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1049.8s)]
*  growth policy. I mean, Egypt's economy has been growing for the last number of years, and it's [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1055.8s)]
*  gotten a lot of praise for the growth and the reforms that it's done. But the private sector [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1060.52s)]
*  has been shrinking. The growth is not, and poverty has been increasing. The growth has not been going [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1063.64s)]
*  to the public. It's been targeted to a handful of sectors that enterprises close to those who [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1069.48s)]
*  rule the country control. And until there's a more even distribution that includes much more of the [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1078.52s)]
*  public, that growth is of limited consequence for the quality of life for the average Egyptian. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1086.2s)]
*  I mean, since the bailout, 5 million people have fallen into poverty. Purchasing power is down 20% [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1091.48s)]
*  still. They've enjoyed years of incredible inflation. So I don't know how much we can even [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1096.92s)]
*  call what's happened so far success except for stabilizing their currency reserves and their [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1103.96s)]
*  access to the private markets for selling debt, which collapsed immediately during this pandemic [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1111.3200000000002s)]
*  until the IMF stepped back in. And now they're starting to recover interest in selling Egyptian [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1116.76s)]
*  debt. You know, this is a global economic crisis, right? So I mean, there's, you know, one of the, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1122.52s)]
*  I think that one of the arguments that I've been hearing people in Egypt making is that, well, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1134.2s)]
*  you know, the whole world economy is suffering from this, and Egypt is, all Egypt needs to do is to do [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1139.6399999999999s)]
*  relatively better, you know, than other countries than others in the region and just kind of muddle [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1146.4399999999998s)]
*  through this, pull through this. Do you see that as viable, you know, or these other factors that [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1152.6s)]
*  you've mentioned, a private sector that is not thriving, as it really would need to be to generate [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1160.04s)]
*  the enormous number of jobs that are needed for the growing labor force, a rising level of poverty? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1167.9599999999998s)]
*  I mean, do you see these things as kind of catching up with Egypt during this crisis, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1174.92s)]
*  or do you think Egypt, you know, Egypt is going to be able to muddle through in a year or two be [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1179.48s)]
*  not worse off than it was before it went into the pandemic? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1185.48s)]
*  I think the whole world's going to be worse off. I don't think anyone can avoid that scenario. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1190.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think that, I mean, as you said, this is a global crisis. I mean, we're talking about [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1193.0800000000002s)]
*  Egypt, but I don't mean to suggest that Egypt's alone in this. I think that some countries are [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1198.84s)]
*  much more vulnerable than other ones in terms of their ability to finance a recovery and to [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1205.56s)]
*  stabilize their economies and provide for the public's needs. I think Egypt, because of its [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1211.0s)]
*  high external vulnerabilities, is less resilient than a lot of other economies, and that's going [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1218.1999999999998s)]
*  to make it all the more challenging to recover. I mean, the IMF noted that Egypt might be the only [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1227.24s)]
*  country that doesn't see a drop in the value of its GDP. I think that might be a very optimistic [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1234.28s)]
*  reading given what we're witnessing. But I guess my concern is Egypt has to borrow right now. I [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1238.68s)]
*  don't disagree with that. I think that pretty much everybody does have to, you know, borrow in order [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1248.6s)]
*  to finance the recovery and their stabilization. The question is, how is that money being spent? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1252.68s)]
*  And what kind of reforms will happen going forward? I mean, the newest IMF lending claims that it's [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1257.72s)]
*  supporting inclusive private sector-led growth, which is what they said last time, and we saw the [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1265.0s)]
*  contrary take place. What are the new policies or what are the new plans between the Egyptian [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1269.88s)]
*  government and their lenders, such as the IMF, the World Bank, et cetera, that are changing the [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1276.1200000000001s)]
*  dynamic going forward? Because I've yet to see any concrete details. And I've been asking for this, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1281.72s)]
*  and I think a lot of people have been. Until anti-competitive practices are removed, until [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1289.32s)]
*  there is more breathing room for civilians and the public to participate in the economy and help [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1295.08s)]
*  build their own country, as opposed to this kind of paternalistic economic structure that we currently [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1302.76s)]
*  have, Egypt will continue to require assistance. Egypt will continue to require debt. Egypt will [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1307.4s)]
*  continue to have a foreign policy built on rent seeking. And these things mean that it will remain [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1313.5600000000002s)]
*  vulnerable and fragile going forward. If the goal of all of this is to stabilize the country [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1319.0800000000002s)]
*  on a sustainable path and eliminate this fragility, then these issues have to be addressed. If the [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1326.2800000000002s)]
*  goal is just to put a bandaid on it and kick the can down the road for a few years, then sure, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1332.44s)]
*  you can stabilize their reserves and their access to selling some debt on the private sector, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1337.96s)]
*  and they'll be okay for a little while. Egypt had a buffer going into this, which is why [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1343.72s)]
*  thankfully it's been, compared to a lot of possibilities, it's been relatively stable. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1350.3600000000001s)]
*  But that buffer is all borrowed. And the next buffer is all going to be borrowed. And so [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1355.48s)]
*  until it can build up its own kind of more sustainable structure, I don't see us escaping [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1362.36s)]
*  that cycle. Okay, well thanks. You've actually gone where I was just going to go. So I did want [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1368.28s)]
*  to talk about the new international monetary fund agreements. So as with many other countries, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1375.0s)]
*  Egypt has gone to the IMF for help. So it's already gotten a $2.8 billion emergency loan. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1381.8s)]
*  That one did not have reform conditions attached to it. But now it is poised to get a $5.2 billion [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1390.04s)]
*  standby arrangement. From what we've heard, this would be a one-year loan [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1398.52s)]
*  dispersed in three tranches. And Egypt also is trying to raise at least another $4 billion [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1404.12s)]
*  in external financing from other sources, among them the World Bank, African Development Bank, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1413.0s)]
*  perhaps JICA, Japan, or some other sources. So we're looking at Egypt for sure needing $10 billion [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1420.28s)]
*  or more in external financing, I think, by in this calendar year. So Amy, thank you for being [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1429.8799999999999s)]
*  patient. I want to turn to you with some questions. And then by the way, I will want to bring Ayman [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1437.72s)]
*  and Tim back in on this IMF program as well, because I think this is an important moment [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1443.8s)]
*  for international engagement with Egypt. So Amy, you have a tremendous amount of experience [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1448.76s)]
*  looking from a civil society point of view at international financial institutions such as the [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1455.72s)]
*  fund and the World Bank and how they engage with Egypt and other countries in the region. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1462.28s)]
*  How do you see this new IMF program? Are you concerned about the level of [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1468.2s)]
*  foreign debt that Egypt is taking on or do you see it unavoidable? And what should the IMF, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1477.88s)]
*  these will be mutually agreed conditions between the Egyptian government and the IMF. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1486.6000000000001s)]
*  What should they be in order to put Egypt in the best situation from both an economic [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1493.24s)]
*  and from a social, from a society point of view to weather and get through this pandemic? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1501.0800000000002s)]
*  Okay, thanks. Thanks, Michelle. Like Timothy, I'm not concerned. Okay, I am concerned about [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1508.7600000000002s)]
*  the loans, but they are unavoidable. It's like this is a situation we are in and most of the countries [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1514.68s)]
*  now are seeking loans to survive. So I'm concerned, but it's unavoidable. So just to mention that [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1520.5200000000002s)]
*  so far in the last few years, Egypt got three loans from the IMF and from the three, the IMF has [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1530.2s)]
*  three types of loans and all of the three types of loan Egypt got so far. So the first one was from [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1539.88s)]
*  extended credit facilities, the ones that 12 billion and then the one that was 2.8 that you [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1548.2s)]
*  mentioned the emergency fund. This was from another instrument called the rapid credit facility. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1554.44s)]
*  And this is the one that just like for urgent need without conditionality. And this one is the [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1560.92s)]
*  standard credit facility that is coming. Actually, this is a golden opportunity for civil society [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1567.56s)]
*  to work with the IMF here or to put pressure on the IMF to act on their own discourse. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1576.92s)]
*  Because in all the IMF evaluation or article four or even the report on that 12 billion dollars, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1583.96s)]
*  I always mentioned two areas of concern. Structure change in terms of governance, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1592.92s)]
*  transparency, participation, and also like the state economy that is overcrowding the private sector. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1601.96s)]
*  And by state here and I guess in one document, they mentioned its military, but even in the other [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1610.84s)]
*  documents behind closed doors, they would say this is what we meant. The military is overcrowding the [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1617.32s)]
*  private sector and this is not good even to create jobs. So they recognize those things. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1623.8799999999999s)]
*  It's just like they need more pressure to enact on this discourse. And this is that's why it's [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1631.8s)]
*  golden opportunity for us to be engaged and ask them to act on this, not only to put it on paper. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1639.8s)]
*  So this is in terms of the IMF. But I also want to talk about the World Bank because the World Bank [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1647.8s)]
*  actually has entry points for us to be engaged. Like the IMF doesn't have those entry points. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1654.52s)]
*  There is no mandatory policy in the IMF to consult with civil society. There is no mandatory [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1661.24s)]
*  policy in the IMF to ask the borrower to engage with civil societies. I will just take about [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1669.32s)]
*  more governance, some measures, and the structure of change. But the World Bank has those entry [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1677.08s)]
*  points and those are the entry points that we should use. So just to give an example, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1683.96s)]
*  the IMF gave a loan and from they have something called the Fast Track Loans Facility and those are [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1690.28s)]
*  loans that are quickly approved before doing all that due diligence. And it's a 50 million loans [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1699.48s)]
*  that went to Egypt for health to deal with COVID-19. The details of the loan, the program, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1705.96s)]
*  are online on the World Bank website. The World Bank under this specific type of loan, they have [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1714.4399999999998s)]
*  mandatory policy called Stakeholder Engagement Plan. And this is exactly what Aiman was talking [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1721.1599999999999s)]
*  about when they didn't engage early on with doctors and with owners of the private. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1728.04s)]
*  It's a mandatory policy in the World Bank. And that this plan, the Stakeholder Engagement Plan [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1738.2s)]
*  is also posted online and it has details each component in this loan. This component should [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1745.08s)]
*  have this specific amount of money. And this is why we always call on civil society, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1753.48s)]
*  please look at those documents. You have the right, the government would submit a report that they [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1760.76s)]
*  had engaged and they were complied. But most of the time, we don't know if those reports are true [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1766.68s)]
*  or not. And if there is violation on this mandatory policy, we can submit official complaint here and [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1773.0s)]
*  make things happen. And this is golden opportunity for us now. And in terms, because you were talking [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1781.96s)]
*  with Timothy about what would be the long-term impact on the economy in Egypt. Just to mention, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1788.04s)]
*  the World Bank was just before COVID-19 had started its process to develop a new [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1795.24s)]
*  country, CPF Country Partnership Framework. This is like the strategy framework for the World Bank [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1803.72s)]
*  engagement. They have started working on this. The first step is systemic country diagnostics, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1813.56s)]
*  which is as the name says, it's a diagnostics for all the opportunities and obstacles to achieve [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1821.16s)]
*  the development objectives. They have started working on it secretly, nothing posted on the [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1827.4s)]
*  website, even though it is mandatory policy that those things should be public. They should be [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1834.0400000000002s)]
*  engaging with civil society. It should be civil society should go to the World Bank and be engaged [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1840.68s)]
*  with the government there. I learned because I have sources inside the World Bank. Anyway, everything [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1849.0s)]
*  now is on hold. And when I asked why it's on hold, they said, because we don't know how it will end. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1855.24s)]
*  So we will have new realities after COVID-19. So we cannot work on this, but we are keeping an eye [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1861.8s)]
*  because as soon as they start, we need to be at the table. This is our right as per the World Bank policies. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1869.24s)]
*  Thank you, Amy. That's really a great education in how civil society can engage with these [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1875.8000000000002s)]
*  institutions. So as you've said, the World Bank and the IMF have different mandates and there are [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1885.0s)]
*  different kinds of conditions or reforms that they could try to make conditions for the [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1891.8000000000002s)]
*  World Bank. So let me turn it again to Iman and to Tim. Iman, I want to ask you, I guess, particularly [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1904.12s)]
*  about the World Bank and about this issue of community engagement and stakeholder engagement [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1913.96s)]
*  in health policy. And of course, you're free to comment on anything else. And then maybe Tim [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1920.04s)]
*  could say a little bit more you already started about the IMF and about the IMF, of course, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1925.8799999999999s)]
*  has more in its mandates, it's more economic and fiscal, so forth, what the kind of things they can [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1931.88s)]
*  ask for. So the question is, what should be on the table at this point, as Egypt goes to the [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1939.88s)]
*  international community and the other institutions as well, the other banks and so forth, what should [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1947.08s)]
*  be on the table, what would be the most helpful reforms that could be made? Iman, let's go to you [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1952.84s)]
*  first. Sure. So yeah, I mean, as Amy and Timothy mentioned, these policies and these recommendations, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1959.32s)]
*  whether it's from the IMF to a lesser extent or from the World Bank, about governance, transparency [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1970.52s)]
*  and participation, they have always been there. And for the World Bank, they have even reached the [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1976.76s)]
*  level of in the last loan, I believe, it was even stated as tranches of the loan. So for example, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1982.28s)]
*  in the health care service component, you had in it specific indicators and requirements for the [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=1991.16s)]
*  creation, for example, of a grievance redress mechanism, which is basically that hospitals and [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2001.8s)]
*  health care service providers needed to have a system where patients could complain and then they [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2006.76s)]
*  would receive feedback on these complaints and investigations would follow and such. And the funds [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2015.8s)]
*  of the World Bank were to be allocated in terms of the number of complaints that were received and the [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2022.28s)]
*  number of complaints that got responses. And each tranche of those were actually associated with a [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2027.8s)]
*  financial component. So this has always been advocated for and even in some cases linked to [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2034.2s)]
*  funds. The major problem is that the government in Egypt always perceived these as things that [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2042.92s)]
*  were not tangible. These were the small obstacles they tried to get rid of and do in the least, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2049.0s)]
*  in the most acceptable kind of way with the least amount of effort, because they always felt that [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2058.28s)]
*  these things did not match the mentality of the Egyptian people. There was this idea that, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2063.32s)]
*  you know, Egyptians, they don't really care about having a complaints mechanism and accountability [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2070.6000000000004s)]
*  and having a seat on the table of the decision making process, because they're not either [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2076.52s)]
*  educated enough or they don't have the knowledge about these democratic processes. For them, these [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2081.6400000000003s)]
*  are very cosmetic things that don't necessarily have an implication on on the ground matters. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2086.6000000000004s)]
*  Now, with the current pandemic, we can clearly see that these things actually end up making a [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2093.6400000000003s)]
*  major differences in how health care services are provided and how policies function and whether [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2102.2000000000003s)]
*  they succeed or not, and how the community engages with these policies. The reason why people end up [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2108.2000000000003s)]
*  going to hospitals at a late stage and therefore increasing the rates of deaths from infections, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2116.44s)]
*  because they were admitted at a late stage, is because they don't trust the service providers, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2123.32s)]
*  primarily. The reason why they don't trust it is because they don't feel any sort of ownership in [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2127.64s)]
*  there and they don't necessarily believe that these people will be able to treat them in the [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2131.88s)]
*  proper way. And this is why they only go when they absolutely need to in the end. And this is why, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2136.36s)]
*  this is like mentioned, a golden opportunity not also to hold the government accountable to do this [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2143.64s)]
*  because it is linked with international funds, but because we now have and we can collect evidence [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2149.56s)]
*  that this actually works, that having these people on the table makes a difference, that providing [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2157.24s)]
*  solutions that are integrated with the health care policy reform that is undergoing, like the [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2164.44s)]
*  health insurance law, for example, or something like having patients' rights shorted, or citizen [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2170.52s)]
*  monitoring mechanisms. We've been involved in numerous initiatives that allow people to monitor [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2177.24s)]
*  the quality of services provided in hospitals, or even recently with the latest outbreak, to allow [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2183.48s)]
*  people to monitor the infection control measures provided in public places, promoting these things [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2189.08s)]
*  and engaging society in a way that capitalizes on this societal innovation is the key to move [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2194.92s)]
*  forward, not just because it's linked to funds from international donors, but also because it [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2201.8s)]
*  makes a difference and this is what really makes society as a whole capable of dealing with the [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2207.56s)]
*  pandemic. Amy, I think you'd like to comment. Yes, I want to agree with Ayman that those types of [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2213.1600000000003s)]
*  mandatory policies have always been there, but to a certain degree not as strong as in this last [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2222.84s)]
*  loan, the emergency loan. The health system loan, the big one that has been going on for years now [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2231.56s)]
*  in Egypt, it's a different type of loan that's called P4R, Program for Results. It has some [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2239.32s)]
*  mandatory component for citizen engagement, like the grievance mechanism, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2246.36s)]
*  but this last one is from another instrument. It's a loan from another instrument. I don't [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2251.88s)]
*  want to go into technical, and there is a new policy that applies to this instrument [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2257.96s)]
*  called the Stakeholder Engagement Plan. It doesn't only about the grievance or consultation at the [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2265.4s)]
*  beginning, but it should be planned from design to evaluation. It says mandatory that the government [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2272.12s)]
*  should report to it. It's also mentioned for the first time, end the agreement that has a legal [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2279.56s)]
*  value between the World Bank and the government. I really want people to look at this document [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2287.88s)]
*  because it's on the World Bank website. I am sure that it's not implemented as it said, and [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2293.7999999999997s)]
*  unfortunately, the government, as Iman said, they always find their ways to work around it, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2301.24s)]
*  but now this being a policy gives us the right to go and officially complain if we know that [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2308.12s)]
*  the government is reporting something that didn't happen as it should be. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2316.2s)]
*  Thanks, Amy. Okay, Tim, I want to ask you about the end of this issue has come up [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2321.4s)]
*  about the IMF and this issue of military companies sort of tilting the playing field economically in [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2328.36s)]
*  Egypt, disadvantaging the private sector, moving into certain sectors of the economy very strongly. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2340.44s)]
*  Moving into certain sectors of the economy very strongly, as Amy mentioned in at least one of the [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2347.88s)]
*  IMF reports, they had a sentence mentioning this, although it's something they're often very shy of [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2353.4s)]
*  talking about publicly because they know it's politically sensitive. What's your point of view [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2359.6400000000003s)]
*  on this? I mean, what would be, are there things that the IMF could try to work with the Egyptian [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2364.12s)]
*  government on that would help to give the private sector a better chance and address this very [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2372.76s)]
*  hot topic of military affiliated companies and their involvement in the economy? [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2381.0s)]
*  I mean, I think that, I mean, it's obviously very politically sensitive and the IMF is reluctant to [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2387.8s)]
*  openly engage with the issue, and I think that they're afraid that frankly, if they were too [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2395.0800000000004s)]
*  forceful, the Egyptians would refuse to deal with them, but they have more leverage now than [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2398.6s)]
*  they probably ever have because Egypt's in need of financing and kind of hard pressed to find it. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2403.3199999999997s)]
*  I guess the issue is multifold. One, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2410.8399999999997s)]
*  Tim, you're- [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2415.4s)]
*  that are owned by officers outside of the military. So there's been a fixation for the last, say, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2427.2400000000002s)]
*  25, 30 years about state owned enterprises and privatization and liberalization as a way to [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2432.84s)]
*  kind of free the market and make it more competitive. What they've done instead is [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2437.4s)]
*  establish a set of regime owned enterprises, if you will. So you have, even if you privatize [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2443.24s)]
*  state owned entities, they're still captured by the regime, and so the political intervention in [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2449.08s)]
*  the economy persists, and you don't actually have the kind of more diverse distribution of economic [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2453.3199999999997s)]
*  activity and economic actors that you were pursuing. Even now, the president has talked about [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2462.68s)]
*  listing some military companies on a stock exchange, but this kind of turns the military [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2467.8s)]
*  almost into a sort of private equity firm in which it builds up companies, sells equity [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2474.1200000000003s)]
*  to raise capital, to then expand its own economic empire as opposed to allowing for public [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2479.0800000000004s)]
*  participation in the economy on a more even playing field. So I mean, the goals should be about [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2485.0s)]
*  promoting three complementary and compounding elements, inclusivity, resilience, and [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2491.2400000000002s)]
*  sustainability. And that means that there should be an even playing field for inclusivity that [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2497.0s)]
*  allows for, for example, if the company is owned by the military or another security apparatus or [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2504.12s)]
*  private sector, it should be subject to the same tax regulations, it should be subject to the same [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2511.08s)]
*  customs rules, it should be subject to the same regulatory frameworks, because all of those [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2515.24s)]
*  competitive advantages for regime owned enterprises deter investment both from the private sector and [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2520.44s)]
*  from foreign in terms of foreign direct investment. The idea of competing with the ruling apparatus [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2526.2s)]
*  on this very uneven playing field is highly unappealing to many investors, unless they're [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2532.2799999999997s)]
*  working directly through the regime of enterprises, through partnerships, for example, because then [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2537.8799999999997s)]
*  they get to reap the benefits of those advantages. But again, that fails to provide for this kind of [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2541.3999999999996s)]
*  more diversified economy that presumably we're going for. So inclusivity, though, beyond just [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2545.96s)]
*  allowing for private sector companies to compete fairly, involves something that the IMF has talked [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2552.44s)]
*  about a lot, which is, but we haven't seen enough progress on, which is addressing the mitigating [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2558.6s)]
*  the impact of all of these reforms on those most vulnerable. So that means that the means tested [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2564.28s)]
*  cash transfers through Tekeflon Karama need to expand dramatically. Currently, roughly a third [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2569.4s)]
*  of Egyptians in poverty are receiving those benefits, leaving two-thirds without any cash [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2573.8s)]
*  assistance. And that's a huge problem. The infrastructure for delivering social assistance [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2579.08s)]
*  needs to be much better developed. And they did a good job at the beginning of rolling this out and [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2584.84s)]
*  adding people to the program, but it slowed down substantially after the first couple of years. And [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2591.88s)]
*  we really need to recommit to expanding it so that every Egyptian in need has access to it. And that [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2598.2s)]
*  and that social assistance has a direct economic benefit because the purchasing power of [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2604.04s)]
*  Egyptians is central to the economic appeal of the Egyptian market. The selling point for Egypt [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2608.92s)]
*  for quite some time has been it's an enormous market you can sell to so many people. Well, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2615.0s)]
*  if those people don't have any money or any purchasing power, then it's much less appealing [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2619.8s)]
*  than it used to be. So empowering people with cash in hand is an important tool to put in their [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2623.4s)]
*  hands beyond the social benefit of it. That inclusivity in terms of allowing the private [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2628.84s)]
*  sector to participate fairly, putting cash in the hands of the Egyptians, compounds into resilience [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2634.6000000000004s)]
*  because the more diverse the economic actors are, the more diverse economic activity is, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2641.56s)]
*  the more resilient the economy is. So it's not dependent on any one particular pillar that an [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2647.6400000000003s)]
*  external shock could knock over. And that resilience translates ultimately to sustainability. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2652.7599999999998s)]
*  And what's really crucial here is that if all of these private sector actors are playing fairly [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2658.7599999999998s)]
*  and all of them are now taxable entities, then the government can focus on raising revenue by [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2665.64s)]
*  actually managing tax policy as opposed to appealing for foreign assistance and other [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2671.0s)]
*  activities involved in rent seeking or regressive tax policies like the one that was supported by [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2675.8799999999997s)]
*  the IMF last time, the VAT, which I understand is the easiest tax to roll out, but hurts the [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2680.12s)]
*  average Egyptian, increases inflation at a time where there was already a serious risk of that, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2685.3199999999997s)]
*  and ultimately leaves the state with underdeveloped tax institutions that are crucial [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2690.8399999999997s)]
*  for stabilizing a sustainable path forward that doesn't require emergency international assistance [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2696.2799999999997s)]
*  on a regular basis. So inclusivity, resilience, sustainability, each one helps contribute and [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2701.08s)]
*  lead to the next. And if your policy package and your reform program doesn't center those three [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2706.6s)]
*  elements, then we're going to keep having this conversation indefinitely. And we've already [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2712.2s)]
*  been having it for a half century. So maybe it's time to kind of refocus the conversation. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2715.72s)]
*  Thanks, Tim. We're going to turn now to the questions from the audience. And [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2722.04s)]
*  please, I have a number of questions lined up, but participants, feel free to go ahead and submit [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2729.0s)]
*  more through the Q&A function there. So the first question that I have, I'm going to put [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2735.32s)]
*  two questions together. And they're for Iman. So these two questions, does Egypt have adequate [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2741.8s)]
*  diagnostic capacity to monitor and assess the spread of the disease? What are the available [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2748.52s)]
*  diagnostic tools? How are they managed? And what is the reason for the government insisting that [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2757.0s)]
*  COVID-19 testing be done by government labs? That's a good question. I wish I had an answer for. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2762.84s)]
*  But yeah, the thing is, so according to the statements given by the government, we have [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2771.08s)]
*  PCR kits, we have rapid testing kits, and we have, of course, CT scans and such. And tests are done [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2778.92s)]
*  following a protocol that is presumably followed by the government to make sure that [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2789.24s)]
*  the right investigation is done at the proper time and the proper progression of the disease, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2796.6s)]
*  following the recommendations from the WHO. The major problem that we have in this case is that, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2801.16s)]
*  first of all, we don't have an official reporting on the number of tests that is being carried out [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2807.64s)]
*  on a regular basis. We hear about this every now and then. So every month or so, maybe in a [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2814.44s)]
*  press conference or a quick statement like this, or for example, when there was a conflict between [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2819.32s)]
*  the medical syndicate and the government, then they began to announce some of the numbers of [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2828.36s)]
*  tests carried out for the medical teams. But other than that, we don't receive a daily or a regular [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2832.28s)]
*  account of the number of tests. The second problem is that, in my opinion, people who seek [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2837.56s)]
*  the investigations, usually the reason why you need to know whether you have a positive case or [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2847.56s)]
*  not is to be able to properly manage the case and to properly treat it in a way, and also to prevent [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2851.7999999999997s)]
*  the spread of disease. As the pandemic has progressed and as the numbers have steadily been [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2857.64s)]
*  growing, the policies of the government regarding this have been also adapting and changing [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2864.36s)]
*  accordingly. So at first, if you were suspecting an infection, if you were exposed to previous [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2869.56s)]
*  cases, you would call the government hotline and they would actually send you an ambulance [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2875.48s)]
*  that would take you for a test. And then within 12 hours, they would tell you the results and if [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2880.92s)]
*  needed, you would get isolated. Isolation was carried out in isolation hospitals, in fever [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2886.92s)]
*  hospitals, and even in new hospitals and university dorms that were specifically designated for this [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2892.76s)]
*  purpose. Now, this is not the case anymore. Now the protocol has changed. Now we're talking about [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2899.48s)]
*  home isolation. Now people are beginning to be supported in getting management and treatment [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2904.92s)]
*  within the settings of their own places rather than going to hospitals. So the management of [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2912.36s)]
*  the situation has different. And so the capacity of the government to carry out tests for everyone [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2917.8s)]
*  has definitely decreased tremendously. I don't know if this answers the question or not. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2924.6800000000003s)]
*  Thank you. Let's see, I have an economic question here and I think probably this will be for Tim. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2930.44s)]
*  What happens to the Egyptian pound if all the primary sources of hard currency, remittances, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2937.32s)]
*  tourism, gas exports, Suez Canal are impaired for the long term? And is the Egyptian pound [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2942.84s)]
*  overvalued right now? Unmute yourself, Tim. Sorry, that's a good question. It's one that we're all [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2949.4s)]
*  asking. In a floating currency market, in theory, a huge loss in dollars for emerging markets would [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2958.44s)]
*  mean a devaluation for sure. And we've started to see very recently some slide in the value of the [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2969.16s)]
*  Egyptian pound, which is to be expected. The fact that we saw massive outflows and no shift in the [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2975.3199999999997s)]
*  value of the pound for quite some time suggests that it continues to be managed. And we've had [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2981.0s)]
*  other indications of that over the last, I would say two years, more than two years now. Yeah. So [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2985.56s)]
*  the latter half of 2018, it was pegged more or less unofficially through some mechanism with [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2991.64s)]
*  large state banks. Reuters uncovered that the central bank made a statement that now we've [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=2999.08s)]
*  removed this repatriation facility, so expect more volatility. And then it's just been going steadily [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3004.3599999999997s)]
*  up in value ever since until this pandemic struck. And there's been a very big debate to what extent [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3009.0s)]
*  the increase in value is real versus managed. And some people think that the inflows of dollars, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3015.48s)]
*  not because the economy is growing, but because Egypt is having so much success selling short-term [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3022.6s)]
*  debt, has allowed for the currency to gain all this value. Other people think that those inflows [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3027.8s)]
*  are insufficient for explaining the extent to which it's gone up. I am not an expert in econometrics, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3035.64s)]
*  so I'm not going to venture an opinion on that. But what I can say is that I look at any FX value [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3042.44s)]
*  in Egypt with a lot of skepticism and suspect that the central bank is playing a role in at [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3051.48s)]
*  least stabilizing any movement in the currency. So it's not totally subject to market forces for [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3058.2000000000003s)]
*  sure. Regardless of whether or not it was overvalued at the beginning of the year, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3064.36s)]
*  it is certainly based on all the things that are happening, it would make sense for it to decline [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3071.0s)]
*  in value going forward. I expect it to go down in value throughout the year, unless they decide [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3078.04s)]
*  that they want to peg and protect it. But at some point, that becomes unsustainable. And it'd be [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3085.48s)]
*  better to allow it to do so gradually than to protect it for a long time as they did in the past [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3091.24s)]
*  and then allow a sudden drop in value, which not only does it create a shock in terms of inflation, [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3095.3199999999997s)]
*  it also undermines public faith in the currency and encourage dollarization. If people are [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3100.52s)]
*  constantly seeing collapses in the currency, they won't trust it. If its fluctuations are more modest, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3105.72s)]
*  then they can get used to that sort of thing. Thanks, Tim. I have a question here that I'd like [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3111.3999999999996s)]
*  to pose to both Amy and Ayman because it's related to civil society. So to what extent has [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3118.12s)]
*  the medical syndicate looked to civil society as a partner? It seems like they might be natural [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3126.7599999999998s)]
*  allies. So let me ask Amy that first and then Ayman. And Amy, I also wanted to ask you to comment [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3135.24s)]
*  on something that Tim said earlier about the Cahul and Karama, these government ways of doing [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3143.16s)]
*  cash transfers to poor members of the society. Tim, I think, thought they were successful, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3152.6s)]
*  but too much too small in scale. Since you work so much with civil society, Amy, could you comment [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3161.56s)]
*  on that and then also on the medical syndicate issue? Thanks, Michelle. I can't comment on the [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3168.44s)]
*  medical syndicate because I don't work with them. But as for the World Bank, civil society that they [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3175.56s)]
*  have to engage with includes syndicates. So it's larger term. So syndicates are recognized as [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3184.84s)]
*  civil society and represent stakeholders that should be at the table from the design phase [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3193.32s)]
*  early on according to the policy. In terms of the other question, sorry, can you repeat it again? [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3200.36s)]
*  This was about Cahul and Karama. It's about how successful you think they've been and whether you [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3209.6400000000003s)]
*  think a big expansion would be a good way to increase social protections? It depends. I [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3217.3199999999997s)]
*  haven't worked directly on it, but I heard different things. So if you ask the IMF and the World Bank, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3224.68s)]
*  they have wonderful reports. And this is the most successful program ever. And it should be repeated [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3231.3199999999997s)]
*  in other countries. But from the point of view of international NGOs, civil society organizations [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3238.3599999999997s)]
*  working on IFIs, we have been always critical of designing the economic program and then at the end [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3245.16s)]
*  attach to it something for safety net. And we always recommend that from early on when you design [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3252.52s)]
*  the economic program, there should be a component in the economic program, not an attachment. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3259.96s)]
*  Like how you look at the vulnerable groups and include them in the economic programs, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3267.0s)]
*  not at the very end after you finish everything, you put an attachment here. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3273.16s)]
*  Okay, thank you. Ayman, what about the issue of the medical syndicate? [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3279.08s)]
*  Well, okay. So first of all, we need to understand a little bit about the dynamics of how the [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3284.68s)]
*  syndicates work. This is actually a very bureaucratic entity. It is not uniform. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3291.7999999999997s)]
*  When a statement is produced by the syndicate, it requires the board of the syndicate to agree on it [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3297.56s)]
*  naturally. And in the end, this is an organization that represents young doctors who are in most [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3307.08s)]
*  cases employees in hospitals and senior doctors who are in most cases the employers and the managers [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3314.76s)]
*  of these facilities in the end. So it's quite difficult to really reach a consensus about any [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3323.24s)]
*  statement or any position in there. That said, with the current pandemic, there has been an [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3331.3999999999996s)]
*  increasingly alarming outcry against the protection needed to be done for the medical teams, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3338.92s)]
*  be it in their working environment or in the treatment and management of their cases if they [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3347.8799999999997s)]
*  got infected or even in terms of their financial remuneration. The syndicate hasn't really been on [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3353.08s)]
*  the table of the decision-making process during this pandemic. And this is a big defect. When [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3364.36s)]
*  the prime minister announced its willingness to create a high council for health to be able to [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3372.44s)]
*  have certain governance to the decision-making process, the syndicate actually submitted [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3381.32s)]
*  a counter proposal or some suggested modifications to the proposal for the new law that was [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3388.92s)]
*  communicated, which included in the formation of this structure more seats to the syndicate. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3394.92s)]
*  And that's it. No civil society, no other stakeholders, no patient groups, no nursing syndicates. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3402.52s)]
*  So in the end, of course, it is extremely important for the medical doctors to be represented in there, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3412.1200000000003s)]
*  but they're not the only parts in this equation. And this is why it is extremely important at this [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3419.0s)]
*  stage to look at the current situation as one that requires a whole-of-society approach. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3425.48s)]
*  We are not going to be able to go through this if we don't include the different parties in there. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3433.4s)]
*  Civil society is receptive to any needs or any requests submitted to it by the government or [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3438.44s)]
*  by service providers. And even the private sector, by the way, there have been numerous attempts and [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3447.96s)]
*  we have seen even the government thanking civil society and the private sector for the kind of [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3453.16s)]
*  donations and support they're trying to providing. But we need to understand that this has never been [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3458.92s)]
*  done because the government asked for something. It was always something that civil society or [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3464.2s)]
*  the private sector thought was needed, but the government never communicated what they actually [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3469.3199999999997s)]
*  need. Do we need personal protective equipment? Do you need ventilators? Do you need, do we need, [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3475.16s)]
*  you know, plans for field hospitals or makeshift hospitals? This was never communicated. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3481.16s)]
*  And this is really the problem that if we don't integrate society either by the government or [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3487.08s)]
*  the syndicate or any service provider, it's not going to work. We need to be able to embrace [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3494.2799999999997s)]
*  innovation and the way to do this is first to ask for what either the syndicate or the ministry needs [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3500.12s)]
*  and to be able to receive it. The kind of impact the demands of the syndicate can achieve if it is [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3508.76s)]
*  actually coupled and pushed by civil society and the private sector would be completely [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3517.64s)]
*  going into a different direction if it is some in comparison to something that is only promoted by [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3524.28s)]
*  the syndicate. Thank you. I mean, let me let me stay with you because we have a couple of questions [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3529.4s)]
*  from participants that frankly, you know, paint a bit of a darker picture of the medical situation [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3536.44s)]
*  than you have. One questioner, for example, says several people have told me hospitals are flooded, [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3544.44s)]
*  patients waiting for hours without a ventilator or even a doctor seeing them. Is this just poor [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3551.56s)]
*  allocation of resources or is capacity reaching its max? And let me give you the other question too [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3557.32s)]
*  is about death rates. Why are death rates in Egypt? It seems, although as you said, the numbers are [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3563.72s)]
*  three. I mean, the latest numbers that I've seen something are something like officially [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3572.52s)]
*  38,000 plus cases, 1,300 or so deaths. But the question is this, why is the death rate of [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3577.7999999999997s)]
*  corona cases recording in Egypt currently one of the highest in the Arab region and Africa? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3585.9599999999996s)]
*  So, what would you say about these two questions? So let me let me actually start with the second [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3591.7200000000003s)]
*  question and I will add to it like a mini answer to one of the questions I actually see [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3597.6400000000003s)]
*  regarding a rumor that was being communicated that the number of people who actually [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3603.4s)]
*  signed up to be donors for the new plasma treatment policy, which means that they have [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3610.1200000000003s)]
*  positive cases, is actually much more than the number of actual cases reported by the government. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3615.4s)]
*  So, first of all, the mortality rates are significantly more accurate than the number [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3621.88s)]
*  of people who get infected because the government is following in its reporting of death is a [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3629.4s)]
*  protocol that accounts for the different variations in there and that is significantly more accurate. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3634.84s)]
*  So, we look at mortality rates more seriously than the number of infected. This is why we have a [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3642.04s)]
*  higher rate of mortality because the first of all, the denominator, which is the number of [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3648.68s)]
*  infected cases is incorrect and this is directly stated by the government and we know it. So, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3654.3599999999997s)]
*  this is the first reason. The second reason is that people go to hospital at a late stage. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3660.68s)]
*  Many of the deaths that were reported by the government according to the government's own [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3666.9199999999996s)]
*  statements arrive at the hospital when they are already in a terminal stage or even in many cases [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3670.44s)]
*  they arrive at the hospital after the death has occurred. So, this is why we have a relatively [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3675.88s)]
*  high mortality rate. Now, to answer the first part of the question, which is, are we actually [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3680.76s)]
*  maxing out in terms of our capacity? Again, governance. What do we know? What is actually [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3687.4s)]
*  stated? According to the government's direct statements, we are not at the maximal capacity. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3692.92s)]
*  And since Egypt has an enormous physical infrastructure, at least of hospitals and [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3701.24s)]
*  hospital beds and such, we do not believe we have reached this level either. But the major problem [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3708.44s)]
*  is management, medical personnel, allocation of resources and actually having a central unit [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3715.24s)]
*  to make sure that a patient would know where to go if needed. We have received reports of people [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3725.16s)]
*  calling the hotline because they're suspecting an infection. Then the ambulance would arrive [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3732.84s)]
*  and they would tell them, you know what, we cannot transport the case. You have to carry them on your [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3738.68s)]
*  own because we do not want the infection. Then they put them in the ambulance. Then they go to [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3742.68s)]
*  the hospital. And when they go to the hospital that is normally part of the plan in a way, [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3747.8s)]
*  they end up not receiving the service that they get. The ambulance, which is a government entity, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3754.76s)]
*  has been transporting them to another government entity, which is the hospital, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3760.44s)]
*  without knowing that this hospital doesn't have this capacity right now to receive this case or [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3764.6800000000003s)]
*  to do this investigation. So, this is what I'm saying when it comes to management and to being [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3768.28s)]
*  able to direct people in the proper way. Who needs the government? And to answer your question, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3775.32s)]
*  why has the government actually not, why have they been very strict about who, which facilities do [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3781.0s)]
*  the tests? Why is it only the government that does the test in the end? At first, it was about making [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3789.4s)]
*  sure that all the cases are properly reported and that they have the source of information regarding [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3795.7200000000003s)]
*  the cases. As the disease has progressed and as the rates and the numbers of infections have been [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3801.8s)]
*  steadily growing, the government needed to create systems that would allow it to expand the number [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3807.6400000000003s)]
*  of tests that could be done to go beyond its own labs, but also to make sure that they are reported [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3815.7200000000003s)]
*  in the proper way. Governance, inclusion of the private sector, including of labs and civil society, [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3821.88s)]
*  in the end, this is how it works. I don't believe we have reached our maximum level, but we look and [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3828.44s)]
*  seem to be reaching that because of the poor management of the current situation. The number [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3836.52s)]
*  of cases that we know is not, that is being reported by the government, is not the most [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3841.08s)]
*  accurate one. This is why we have a relatively high mortality rate and people actually face [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3846.12s)]
*  severe problems in accessing the services that they need, so they end up going late in the end. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3852.76s)]
*  These are impending problems that we have been suffering from in terms of our health care system, [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3858.92s)]
*  even before the pandemic. Our hope was that the time that the coronavirus has allowed the government [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3865.32s)]
*  to actually be agile and innovative in the way it addresses this has not necessarily been sufficient [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3872.92s)]
*  for them to act swiftly in addressing these reforms. This is why civil society is interfering. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3880.2s)]
*  I'm personally managing an initiative where we actually direct people to tell them where they [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3887.24s)]
*  can get the service, not specifically to Corona, but in general. We have, according to the Health [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3892.52s)]
*  Insurance Organization, more than 50% of the population officially insured, but when we look [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3899.72s)]
*  at data from the demographic health survey, for example, you can see that only 8% of the women [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3905.4s)]
*  who are actually entitled to health insurance actually use its services. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3915.48s)]
*  The rest, the easier don't know, they don't trust in the quality or they get lost in the bureaucracy. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3919.88s)]
*  So we have a systematic failure in making sure that people are accessing the services and this [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3925.4s)]
*  is a role civil society can play an immense role in without creating parallel tracks, without [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3932.12s)]
*  building new hospitals. If the government at some point feels that, or according to its figures, [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3937.64s)]
*  it has reached the maximum capacity, it can build two or three hospitals, makeshift hospitals, [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3943.48s)]
*  in a limited amount of time with 300 or 400 beds and it will be able to easily address this. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3950.2799999999997s)]
*  But in the end, it's about management, it's not about resources in my opinion. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3956.8399999999997s)]
*  Thank you, Aiman. We're down to our last five, seven minutes here. I'm going to bundle together [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3961.08s)]
*  a few economic questions for you, Tim, but I also want to, we've had one very core question that's [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3968.7599999999998s)]
*  been submitted and I'm going to, I want to use this to end with, so I want to give all the speakers a [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3975.88s)]
*  heads up. And this is a question that comes to us from someone with the Hands Along the Nile [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3981.56s)]
*  Development Services. So that question that I think we should end on is, what should be the [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3986.84s)]
*  core agenda items for Egypt while recovering from COVID-19? Okay, so I'll give you all a chance at [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3992.2000000000003s)]
*  the end, just one minute to say what you think the top agenda items are. And here, of course, [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=3998.92s)]
*  we're talking primarily in the health and economic sphere. Tim, as I mentioned, there are a bunch of [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4004.92s)]
*  different economic questions. I mean, one of them, you know, just sort of points to the government's [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4011.16s)]
*  difficulty in trying to, you know, impose some sort of limited lockdowns, you know, while [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4017.72s)]
*  trying not to hurt vital sectors, such as real estate, and I would add tourism there. What about, [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4027.7999999999997s)]
*  also, there's another question about the mega projects, such as the new administrative capital. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4035.96s)]
*  You know, we've heard that the government agencies moving there has been postponed. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4042.52s)]
*  Do you expect that the economic effects of the pandemic are really going to slow down those [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4048.84s)]
*  mega projects and what effect does that have? And then there's another question about the informal [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4053.96s)]
*  the informal sectors. Sorry, I'm just going, just trying to find that question and whether we're [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4061.0s)]
*  going to be seeing, will we see changes to illicit economies, such as smuggling, illegal arms sales, [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4067.48s)]
*  terrorist financing, and so forth as a result of this. So if you could, you know, answer a few of [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4077.3199999999997s)]
*  those questions and then we'll give each of you a moment to say something about what you think the [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4083.64s)]
*  key agenda items should be for Egypt right now. Okay, so I mean, I think that we're, [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4089.4s)]
*  with the new administrative capital, for example, it's, the delay is to be expected. There's been a [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4097.32s)]
*  slowdown in construction activity in general. There's been an effort to maintain some movement [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4103.48s)]
*  on that, but not on the same scale as existed before the pandemic. So that delay is to be [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4107.16s)]
*  expected. The pace of recovery in terms of finishing that project is going to depend also [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4114.12s)]
*  on accessing financing and the appetite for people buying property in that area because that's, [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4119.24s)]
*  because a lot of the development there is a cashflow issue as well. If people aren't, [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4125.96s)]
*  people aren't speculatively buying units, then there isn't enough cash with developers to [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4131.96s)]
*  continue their projects. So it's kind of hard to predict that depending on how this kind of [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4138.36s)]
*  plays out in the long term. With respect to the government trying to balance [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4143.16s)]
*  lockdown with the economy, yeah, I mean, this comes back to the issue of inclusivity and resilience [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4151.0s)]
*  that I was getting at earlier. Without a proper infrastructure for social support, [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4156.68s)]
*  it's very hard to tell people stay home. Without a mechanism for getting cash in the hands of people [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4161.8s)]
*  safely, it's hard to even distribute benefits you'd want to distribute. There was a problem [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4169.32s)]
*  where people were showing up at post offices in large crowds to get the 500 pounds that informal [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4173.96s)]
*  workers were being offered. Most of the country doesn't have a bank account, so transferring funds [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4178.759999999999s)]
*  that way is not really feasible. There's a lot of infrastructure problems in terms of social [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4183.799999999999s)]
*  assistance that exacerbate the challenge for the government in terms of needing to keep people home [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4189.88s)]
*  at the moment. And then poverty, of course, compounds all of this. With a third of the [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4195.88s)]
*  population in poverty before the pandemic, and who knows how many now, there is an urgency for so many [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4201.96s)]
*  of those people to work every day. And so telling people stay home or reduce your economic activity [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4208.92s)]
*  or reduce going out and using public transportation is borderline impossible, which is why, while some [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4214.76s)]
*  people were calling for a more comprehensive lockdown, including many medical professionals, [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4221.5599999999995s)]
*  that I don't think was something that the government was prepared to pursue. And I think [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4226.839999999999s)]
*  the slower curve deterred them even further. They kind of took a little bit of comfort in that. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4231.5599999999995s)]
*  Because at that point, you'd have to be distributing assistance directly to the [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4238.759999999999s)]
*  entire population or much of it. Because while a third of the population is in poverty, [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4242.04s)]
*  around 60% of the world bank is very close to poverty or below poverty. So you have a huge [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4246.6s)]
*  number of people who just simply cannot survive for any duration of time without going to work. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4251.320000000001s)]
*  So yeah, these structural issues that frankly played Egypt before all of this have exacerbated [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4257.56s)]
*  the challenge for the government. I would say that on certain things, they acted very quickly, [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4263.64s)]
*  like shutting down schools and universities, shutting down tourism, which is something they [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4267.8s)]
*  definitely didn't want to do. They shut down the airport in mid-March, I know because I've seen [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4271.8s)]
*  a lot of the data they did. So I'm very sure about that. So I mean, compared to even the United [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4276.36s)]
*  States in that respect, they moved quicker. But yeah, on other things, there's been a lot of [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4283.88s)]
*  critical debate about the lockdown, about loosening the curfew during Ramadan to accommodate Iftar. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4290.76s)]
*  From an economic perspective, I don't understand it. Economic activity in Ramadan is already down [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4297.16s)]
*  anyways. I understand people would like to have Iftar with their families. But if you ever had [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4300.68s)]
*  an opportunity to minimize the cost of reducing movement, that was the time to do it. People can [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4305.0s)]
*  stay home at night, skip the group Iftar, skip the possibility of becoming a new cluster, [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4311.72s)]
*  and ride this out, as opposed to now we have a stricter curfew after Ramadan than we did before, [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4320.6s)]
*  which is the current situation. So I would have taken a different approach personally, [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4326.04s)]
*  given the priorities that the government was dealing with, the resources available. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4333.4s)]
*  But it's not my call, obviously. Tim, just on the final point about what should be the core agenda [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4337.719999999999s)]
*  items. I mean, you've made an argument here for, in looking at the economy, inclusivity, resilience, [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4345.0s)]
*  and sustainability. Is that your agenda for the core items for Egypt, or do you have anything [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4351.32s)]
*  else you want to add? My argument from the beginning has been that the pandemic, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4358.84s)]
*  while it has unique elements, has also just exposed the more structural problems that we've been [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4364.52s)]
*  talking about for a very long time. This crisis for Egypt, and frankly for a lot of countries, [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4368.360000000001s)]
*  including our own in the United States here, is an opportunity to really see very clearly, A, [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4375.08s)]
*  where the problems are. For example, in the United States, health insurance being tied to employment [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4380.6s)]
*  has obviously not worked out well, given the unemployment figures. But it exposes and shines [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4385.56s)]
*  a very bright light on the problems. And I think given how much financing will have to be brought [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4391.080000000001s)]
*  to bear to recover anyways, let's try to allocate it in a way that allows for a more inclusive and [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4397.8s)]
*  resilient economy that is sustainable. And I think that, I mean, I've outlined some of those [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4403.4800000000005s)]
*  things here today. I've outlined more of it in my writing. And I think that that needs to be the [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4407.240000000001s)]
*  focus of the conversation. And there are many different ways to do that. But I think that [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4412.28s)]
*  focusing on those objectives is crucial to Egypt being on a healthier path going forward, [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4417.24s)]
*  both economically and in terms of health. Thank you, Tim. Amy, how about you? What are your core [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4423.88s)]
*  agenda items for Egypt as it tries to come through this pandemic? I agree with Tim that the COVID-19 [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4429.96s)]
*  crisis was really a golden opportunity to highlight all the defects that we have in the system. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4438.68s)]
*  And now we need to evaluate what went wrong. So for example, Ayman was telling us a lot of stories [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4446.52s)]
*  to highlight the mismanagement of resources. It's not the lack of resources that the mismanagement [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4452.76s)]
*  and something needs to be done here. So I guess a governance issue and good management of resources [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4458.68s)]
*  should be the most important topic. And we have golden opportunity, as you said, Michelle and Tim, [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4467.16s)]
*  that now Egypt needs those international institutions. And we can really exercise [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4473.48s)]
*  pressure on them because they have leverage now more than ever. Ayman, your thoughts on the core [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4479.639999999999s)]
*  core items? Yeah, I mean, I definitely agree with all of that has been said. I would just add [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4487.4s)]
*  to it integration. So integration with the current plans, integration with the health insurance [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4494.76s)]
*  reform program. This is a golden opportunity for this to happen. Promoting participation and [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4502.52s)]
*  shared ownership, promoting the role of civil society and private sector and society and [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4509.16s)]
*  communities and localities in this equation. This is extremely important now more than ever. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4515.08s)]
*  And embracing innovation. What I mean by embracing innovation is first to ask, so to say, [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4520.68s)]
*  hey, dear civil society, dear private sector, we are facing this problem. What can you do to help? [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4527.24s)]
*  And then to actually be able to receive, to be able to provide these services the space [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4533.56s)]
*  that they need to actually present the kind of solutions that the government is needed. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4541.32s)]
*  And I think this is really what a whole of society approach means in this context. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4545.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. I really want to thank all three of you, Amy Akhdawi, Tim Calvas, [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4552.599999999999s)]
*  and Ayman Sabah for what I think has been a great discussion. I've really learned a lot. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4558.44s)]
*  And I want to thank all of our participants and remind you this is the first of three sessions. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4563.48s)]
*  This is a three part series on Egypt Faces the Pandemic. And the session one week from today, [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4569.96s)]
*  on June 18th, will deal with political and rights and global foreign relations aspects of the [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4576.2s)]
*  pandemic. And then the third session on June 25th, will deal with some of Egypt's enduring [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4584.36s)]
*  challenges, population growth, now water issues, and marginalized regions and communities. I hope [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4590.2s)]
*  you'll join us for all three of these. Thanks very much for being with us today. I apologize [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4596.84s)]
*  to those whose questions I couldn't get to, but please come back and engage with us the next two [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4602.04s)]
*  weeks. And thanks everyone and have a good day and keep well. Thank you. Thank you, Michelle. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4607.8s)]
*  Thank you, Tim. Thank you, Amy. Thank you. Bye. Bye bye. Have a good day. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALuCvYyWoZ8&t=4615.16s)]
