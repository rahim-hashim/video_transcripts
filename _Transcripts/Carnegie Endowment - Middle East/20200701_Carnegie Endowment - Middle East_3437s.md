Video Description: As of July 1, the Israeli government will be free under the terms of the current coalition agreement to annex and officially extend its legal authority over large parts of the occupied West Bank. This will leave Palestinians with neither a viable and sovereign state of their own nor political rights as citizens of Israel. What will be the Palestinian response to Israeli annexation? What does this mean for the future of the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization? How will the relationship between Israelis and Palestinians change? 

Join us for a timely discussion with the prime minister of Palestine, Mohammad Shtayyeh, on the way forward for the Palestinian national movement.

# The Way Forward for Palestine: A Conversation with Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [July 01, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s)
*  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this special event with His Excellency Dr. Mohammad Jadayyeh, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=0.0s)]
*  Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=15.36s)]
*  My name is Marwan Maasher and I'm the Vice President for Studies in charge of the Middle [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=18.56s)]
*  East program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=23.1s)]
*  Today is July 1st. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=28.02s)]
*  This is the date when Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has vowed to take steps to annex [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=30.06s)]
*  large parts of the West Bank in accordance with the U.S. Trump plan inappropriately labeled [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=35.3s)]
*  as the deal of the century. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=41.28s)]
*  The PNA has rejected the plan as well as annexation and has vowed to stop all coordination with [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=43.62s)]
*  Israel, basically ending what many people feel is an already dying Oslo framework. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=50.1s)]
*  Most people believe annexation will drive the last nail in the coffin of the two-state [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=60.86s)]
*  solution. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=64.72s)]
*  Jordan has taken a very strong stand against annexation as it believes the end of the two-state [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=66.26s)]
*  solution provides it with an existential threat. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=72.2s)]
*  The Arab world has so far opposed annexation but without any strong collective measure. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=76.78s)]
*  189 members of Congress wrote President Trump urging him to stop annexation and another [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=81.5s)]
*  18 members of the U.S. Senate also wrote to Prime Minister Netanyahu against annexation. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=90.34s)]
*  The EU High Representative Joseph Borrell has warned Israel that relations with the EU will [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=97.62s)]
*  be affected if Israel goes ahead with annexation and Boris Johnson wrote today urging Israel [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=103.62s)]
*  not to annex as well. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=110.66000000000001s)]
*  Today we are seeing indications that Israel may be postponing taking a decision on annexation [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=114.14s)]
*  under pressure from the U.S. as well as some domestic considerations. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=120.78s)]
*  Is that the case and does the timing and size of annexation change the overall picture? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=127.34s)]
*  With us to discuss all these issues and more is His Excellency Dr. Mohammed Jadiyah, Prime [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=135.3s)]
*  Minister of the Palestinian National Authority, a dear friend, a colleague if I may say so, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=141.7s)]
*  when we were together on the Jordanian-Palestinian joint negotiating team back about 30 years [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=148.34s)]
*  ago at the start of the Madrid and then of the Oslo process, Dr. Jadiyah is a member [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=155.66s)]
*  of the Fatah Central Committee. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=163.7s)]
*  He has been a central figure in negotiations on the Palestinian team for many, many years. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=165.5s)]
*  And I would like to welcome Dr. Jadiyah to this event. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=173.7s)]
*  I will also say before we start the discussion that after the discussion with Prime Minister [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=177.74s)]
*  Jadiyah and questions from myself and my fellow Carnegie scholars Zaha Hassan and Aaron Miller [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=183.66000000000003s)]
*  who are joining us on the screen now, we will turn to the audience for questions. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=192.74s)]
*  Please submit your questions at any time in the YouTube chat or privately submit questions [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=198.34s)]
*  to MiddleEast at CEIP.org. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=204.42000000000002s)]
*  Dr. Jadiyah, I'd like to start. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=208.78s)]
*  We only have an hour. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=215.7s)]
*  So and there are so many questions both from us as well as from the audience. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=216.7s)]
*  So I would like to jump right into this and ask you about the Palestinian strategy moving [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=221.26s)]
*  forward. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=228.86s)]
*  If Trump is reelected and Israel indeed moves forward with annexation with the full backing [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=230.42000000000002s)]
*  of the U.S. administration, at one point, does the Palestinian national movement pivot, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=237.42s)]
*  if at all, to a one bi-national state solution? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=246.7s)]
*  Is that on the cards at all? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=251.42s)]
*  What is the debate among the Palestinian leadership about this? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=253.82s)]
*  We just saw an article by your predecessor, ex-Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, calling for [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=258.34s)]
*  a new paradigm in which he includes a one state solution as one of the options that [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=264.5s)]
*  the Palestinians have. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=270.34s)]
*  And on the other hand, if Mr. Biden is reelected, does that mean that the two state solution [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=272.34s)]
*  is still viable, is still realistic? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=279.14s)]
*  And what steps are you going to take in order to revive this process? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=281.46s)]
*  Let me start with these two sets of questions and take it from there. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=290.18s)]
*  Thank you so much, my dear brother and friend Marwan. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=295.74s)]
*  It has been a long time. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=298.46s)]
*  It's good to see you. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=300.02s)]
*  Thanks for Zaha for organizing this. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=301.46s)]
*  And Aaron, my dear friend, so good to see you as well. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=303.58s)]
*  Your hair is getting gray as well as Marwan's and mine since we have been in this process [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=307.26s)]
*  since 1991. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=312.21999999999997s)]
*  And all of us now have kids at universities and we are getting old. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=314.58s)]
*  It's not only us, but the process is really aging. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=320.66s)]
*  Going back to your question, Marwan, I think you really hit the nail on its head. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=324.22s)]
*  Look, first of all, I think when it comes really to two states, there is a systematic [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=329.58s)]
*  destruction of the two state solution. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=335.5s)]
*  What Israel has been doing since early days of occupation, the construction of settlements, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=338.5s)]
*  expropriation, expelling people, the geographic demographic factors, the total isolation of [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=344.65999999999997s)]
*  Gaza, the whole city of Jerusalem, the also special measures in the Jordan Valley. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=351.74s)]
*  All these measures have been there. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=357.86s)]
*  They have nothing to do with annexation as it has been defined today. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=360.74s)]
*  There is a creeping annexation process that has started from the early days of occupation [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=365.09999999999997s)]
*  with the construction of Jewish settlements. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=371.90000000000003s)]
*  Now, the room for hope was still there, that there is a Palestinian consensus on two states, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=373.90000000000003s)]
*  there is an Arab consensus on two states. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=380.58s)]
*  The Arab BIS initiative has stated clearly that all Arabs are for that option and internationally [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=382.58s)]
*  there is this sort of consensus about two states. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=389.02s)]
*  The question is that you really don't have a partner in Israel for two states. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=392.66s)]
*  The problem today is that the debate in Israel that used to be between those who want to [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=397.7s)]
*  maintain the status quo and those who want to continue with the agreements, the debate [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=402.9s)]
*  today in Israel is between what to annex. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=410.9s)]
*  The debate in Israel today is not to annex or not to annex. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=414.42s)]
*  It's not between peace camp and war camps. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=417.7s)]
*  Unfortunately, the debate in Israel today is what to annex, the settlements or the Jordan [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=420.06s)]
*  Valley. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=426.3s)]
*  For the Palestinians, I will tell you that we continue to be committed to two-state solution, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=428.1s)]
*  yes, simply because of all this national consensus, regional consensus, international consensus. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=434.1s)]
*  And I think it is a viable solution. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=440.1s)]
*  Maybe it's not the best solution. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=443.02000000000004s)]
*  But on the other hand, when it comes to one-state solution, we live in one-state reality today [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=445.1s)]
*  because Israel fully and fully controlling all of Palestine from River Jordan to the [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=451.54s)]
*  Mediterranean Sea. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=457.62s)]
*  The question is also that Israel does really, Israel wants a one-state solution. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=458.62s)]
*  I think the answer is no. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=464.34000000000003s)]
*  I remember very well Vitzval Havel when he asked Ehud Barak, are you ready to live with [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=466.22s)]
*  the Palestinians? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=471.02000000000004s)]
*  Ehud Barak told him my mother came all the way from Poland not to live with the Polish. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=472.02000000000004s)]
*  For sure she will not be happy to live with the Palestinians. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=477.46000000000004s)]
*  So it's not there. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=480.54s)]
*  The two-state solution is not in the mind of the Israelis. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=482.54s)]
*  The one-state solution is not in the mind of the Israelis as well. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=485.54s)]
*  For us, to be frank with you, we are ready for any solution. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=489.54s)]
*  If the Israelis are ready for two states, we are ready for that. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=493.54s)]
*  The international community wants that. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=497.54s)]
*  We want that. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=499.54s)]
*  The Israelis are divided on this issue. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=500.54s)]
*  Unfortunately, the peace camp in Israel is shrinking those who believe in two states. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=502.54s)]
*  For us, the one-state solution, maybe this is the reality that we will see ourselves [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=508.1s)]
*  driven into. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=513.1s)]
*  Whether that is one state is about one man, one vote, equal rights, for sure not. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=515.1s)]
*  The one state that we live in today is an apartheid state. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=521.6s)]
*  And whatever one-state solution or one-state reality is going to be, it is going to be [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=524.6s)]
*  an apartheid state. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=530.5s)]
*  The issue here is one important issue that has to do with demography. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=532.22s)]
*  Today for the first time, my dear friend Marwan and the dear colleagues, today for the first [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=537.02s)]
*  time since 1948, Palestinians between River Jordan and Mediterranean Sea are more in numbers [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=541.22s)]
*  by 200,000 people. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=547.9399999999999s)]
*  There are 6.9 million Palestinians, West Bank, Gaza, including Palestinians in Israel, and [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=549.9s)]
*  there are 6.7 million Israeli Jews who live in the area. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=555.9s)]
*  So either Israel goes into this direction of two states, which we want, or we will be [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=560.18s)]
*  slipping into a one-state reality which nobody wants. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=566.5799999999999s)]
*  So therefore, for us, that is where we are heading. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=570.9s)]
*  There is a Palestinian consensus on a two-state solution, which we are committed to, which [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=575.18s)]
*  the Arab Peace Initiative has clearly spoken about that. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=580.6999999999999s)]
*  Palestinian National Council has explicitly stated that our goal is a two-state solution. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=586.02s)]
*  Let me follow up on that. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=593.5799999999999s)]
*  Let me follow up on that. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=595.38s)]
*  If, as you said, you are driven to a one-state reality, if conditions become clear that the [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=596.38s)]
*  two-state solution is no longer viable and you are driven against your choice to a one-state [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=603.38s)]
*  reality, does that mean that the Palestinian National Authority is ready to abandon the [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=609.38s)]
*  paradigm of Oslo and start calling for equal rights within the state it lives in, or is [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=616.38s)]
*  that off the table? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=624.38s)]
*  In other words, if we go to a one-state reality, will the question become then, is that one-state [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=626.38s)]
*  reality a democratic state or an apartheid state, or would the PNA not consider this [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=636.38s)]
*  option at all? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=642.38s)]
*  And I'll follow up with another question in the interest of time also. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=644.38s)]
*  If Israel today, if Mr. Netanyahu says, I'm not going to go for full annexation, I will [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=649.38s)]
*  go for a symbolic annexation today, does that change the equation or is the very concept [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=655.38s)]
*  of annexation anithema to the two-state solution regardless of the size and timing? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=662.38s)]
*  Would you consider resuming negotiations if Mr. Netanyahu goes ahead with a symbolic annexation [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=669.38s)]
*  rather than full annexation or not? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=677.38s)]
*  And if you can address the question of equal rights, that would be great. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=679.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=685.38s)]
*  Very important question. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=687.38s)]
*  Let me just shed some light on what if is Trump elected and what if is Biden elected, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=689.38s)]
*  referring to your first question, because that was important. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=696.38s)]
*  I don't want to miss that. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=699.38s)]
*  By all means, the Trump initiative we know. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=701.38s)]
*  We know that it has been born dead. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=704.38s)]
*  We know President Trump has no partners into this. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=707.38s)]
*  And we know that it's not only that we who rejected the Trump initiative, the Arabs, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=710.38s)]
*  as you said, the Europeans, the international community in general, and United States Congress, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=715.38s)]
*  some senators, United States intellectuals, many, many in the world have rejected this. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=720.38s)]
*  So one, if President Biden, if Mr. Biden is going to be elected, we hope it's a different story. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=726.38s)]
*  We hope that United States will reverse the decisions that has been taken by the Trump initiative on one hand. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=734.38s)]
*  And also, frankly, we hope that there will be some sort of American-Palestinian relationship [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=740.38s)]
*  that is not Israeli-centric. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=748.38s)]
*  The problem between in the Palestinian-American relationship that it is only focused on Israel. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=750.38s)]
*  We want an American-Palestinian relationship, a bilateral relationship that is not Israeli-centric. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=755.38s)]
*  And therefore, if Mr. Biden will be elected by November, the coming November, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=761.38s)]
*  we hope that it will be a totally different dynamic. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=767.38s)]
*  Now, coming to this, every American president has actually tried to solve the problem. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=770.38s)]
*  We have seen it with Bush, the father in Madrid, October 1991. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=777.38s)]
*  You were there, Marwan, I was there. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=781.38s)]
*  And we have seen it with actually all American presidents. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=783.38s)]
*  The problem is that none one single American president has been successful to solve the problem. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=786.38s)]
*  Why? Because Israel has pushed him to fail. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=792.38s)]
*  I remember what John Kerry said after 47 rounds of negotiations with us. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=795.38s)]
*  John Kerry stood up at the Israeli television channel too, and he said, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=800.38s)]
*  Well, look, for a country to continue building settlements on a territory that is supposed to be a state for the other side, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=806.38s)]
*  it means that that country is not really about, is not the intentions of that country are not about peace. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=813.38s)]
*  And I think that is how John Kerry was pushed to fail. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=820.38s)]
*  Now, so this is about the internal American elections vis-a-vis the question of Palestine and the peace process. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=823.38s)]
*  On your other question, my dear friend, we have to look at the Israel-Palestine conflict in the eyes of the settler colonial literature. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=831.38s)]
*  The literature that does describe the Palestine-Israel conflict is settler colonialism. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=843.38s)]
*  Why do I say this? I say this because either the issue becomes about liberation of land or about rights. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=850.38s)]
*  If you go from classical colonialism into internal colonialism, the case of Algeria, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=860.38s)]
*  the case of internal colonialism of South Africa and all the models that we have seen in the world. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=868.38s)]
*  Now, we are at the situation in which moving Israel, making this annexation in particular, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=874.38s)]
*  because this annexation is a serious existential threat for the Palestinian national project. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=884.38s)]
*  It's the whole idea of two states that we have been fighting for will fully be and totally eroded. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=890.38s)]
*  The erosion of a two-state solution has to do with the total isolation of Gaza, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=897.38s)]
*  has to do with the annexation of Jerusalem, which has taken place in 1980, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=902.38s)]
*  has to do with using 60% of the West Bank as geographic reservoir for the expansion of Jewish settlements. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=907.38s)]
*  And now talking about the Jordan Valley or extension of Israeli law over certain settlements. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=915.38s)]
*  By all means, what we are driven into with this annexation, whether Marwan, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=921.38s)]
*  whether it is a minor annexation or a large portion, you see, if somebody is stealing $1,000 [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=927.38s)]
*  and somebody else is stealing $1 million, both are thieves. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=934.38s)]
*  The issue is not about portion of annexation. You know, this is small and this is big. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=939.38s)]
*  We are totally against because occupation is illegal under international law and annexation is illegal under international law. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=944.38s)]
*  Not only that. We and the Israelis, we signed agreements. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=952.38s)]
*  And these agreements that has been signed explicitly states that the Palestinian domain of geography should be enlarging, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=958.38s)]
*  enlarge in an incremental way, i.e. area A should become larger and larger until all of the West Bank becomes under the domain of the Palestinian authority, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=967.38s)]
*  except for what they call the final status negotiations, which is Jerusalem, borders, settlements, water and refugees. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=980.38s)]
*  Now, the problem with what the Trump initiative, it does fully put off the table all the final, all the final status issues and bring us back into a situation in which the ultimate solution will become conditional upon performance of the Palestinian author. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=989.38s)]
*  Now, for us, what did we say? We are saying the following. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1008.38s)]
*  The bilateral paradigm of negotiation has not been the answer to this conflict. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1014.38s)]
*  Therefore, we have to go into serious paradigm shift from bilateral, which is shepherd. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1022.38s)]
*  The shepherd hood of this bilateral Israeli Palestinian is the United States does that does enjoy monopoly over the process. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1030.38s)]
*  We should. This monopoly has not been useful because United States is a biased broker into the process. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1038.38s)]
*  And we have seen it. There has been no progress on the bilateral track. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1047.38s)]
*  Now, what is the paradigm shift means? It means that we are ready to go from bilateral paradigm to multilateral paradigm. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1052.38s)]
*  And this multilateral paradigm, the core of it can be the quartet. Why? Because we also believe, which is true, that without United States, there will be no solution. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1061.38s)]
*  And with United States only, there will be no solution. So you need a wider forum. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1074.38s)]
*  And this wider forum can be the quartet plus Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, you know, certain European countries and so on. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1081.38s)]
*  So we are ready for negotiations. We are ready to go to a meeting called for by the quartet. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1090.38s)]
*  And we are ready to negotiate on the basis of international law, United Nations resolutions, or we can start back again into the agreements that has been signed. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1098.38s)]
*  If Israel is ready to say that I'm ready to fulfill my my responsibility of the signed agreement and respect them, we are ready to do so. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1111.38s)]
*  But we cannot repeat the same question, the same mistake every now and then. We know we are not going anywhere with that. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1120.38s)]
*  Thank you so much. Let me turn it over to Zaha for for her questions. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1128.38s)]
*  Hello, Dr. Shteya. Thank you so much for agreeing to take part in this conversation today. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1134.38s)]
*  I know you're busy given the moment that you're in. I have a couple of questions for you. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1141.38s)]
*  The first one I want to ask relates to Palestinians and the national project. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1147.38s)]
*  With the demise of the Oslo framework and its two state solution, it's clear that Palestinians need to convene a national dialogue to discuss the political platform that was adopted in 1988. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1153.38s)]
*  That forwent national liberation over the entirety of historic Palestine in favor of a Palestinian state in the 1967 occupied Palestinian territories. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1167.38s)]
*  Many Palestinians, however, particularly in the diaspora, did not support the start of Oslo peace process in 1993 because it legitimated Israeli presence in the occupied territories. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1178.38s)]
*  They failed to explicitly protect the rights of Palestinian refugees who constitute the majority of the global population of Palestinians. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1190.38s)]
*  And because it did not clearly identify a sovereign Palestinian state as the ultimate objective. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1198.38s)]
*  In fact, in 1995, following the signing of Oslo Interim Agreement, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin clearly stated before the Knesset that the objective of Oslo was to ensure that Israel would remain 80% Jewish and that the Palestinian entity, that's his his phrase, could be something less than a state. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1205.38s)]
*  And that's a quote from him. Something less than a state. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1227.38s)]
*  Following annexation, what mechanisms will the Fatah leadership agree to to ensure that all Palestinians may be part of the process to reimagine the Palestinian national project, recognizing that the PLO has never had direct elections and the factional representation system is outdated and no longer representative of the Palestinian body politic? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1230.38s)]
*  Well, thank you, Zaha. Thank you for organizing this and thank you for the questions. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1255.38s)]
*  Look, I mean, by all means, 1998 was actually the year of national consensus. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1264.38s)]
*  It is the year in which Palestinians for the first time accepted 242 and accepted and declared independence of an independent Palestinian state on the borders of 1967, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1271.38s)]
*  which consequently led to the two-state solution. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1283.38s)]
*  Now, the Oslo process, people, including myself, why did we accept Oslo as a process and the interim agreement of 1995? [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1287.38s)]
*  Why did we accept it? We did accept it because it did create a Palestinian interim authority. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1297.38s)]
*  The official name of the Palestinian authority is BISCA, Palestinian Interim Self-Governing Authority. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1304.38s)]
*  And the process was a gradual process. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1311.38s)]
*  The interim character of the Palestinian authority should have ended by May 4, 1999, which didn't. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1314.38s)]
*  And the problem is that all Palestinians who did support Oslo, we know what are the problems of Oslo. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1322.38s)]
*  We know it was an interim agreement. It was not a comprehensive agreement. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1332.38s)]
*  We know it should have been a comprehensive agreement with phased implementation and so on, all the problems of Oslo. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1337.38s)]
*  But what I'm saying is the following, that it has been agreed that the solution is incremental. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1344.38s)]
*  Unfortunately, Israel reversed the process. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1351.38s)]
*  The issue of the Palestinian refugees was a negotiation issue and Nabil Sha'ath, Yasser Arafat, Abu Mazen, all. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1354.38s)]
*  And maybe Aaron was there in Camp David. It was a negotiation issue. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1364.38s)]
*  The issue of refugees was on the table. The issue of settlements was on the table. Jerusalem was on the table. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1369.38s)]
*  These issues were discussed in Taba. The refugees with the Israeli foreign minister at the time, Shlomo Ben-Ami, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1375.38s)]
*  we reached some ground on the issue of right of return of refugees and so on. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1384.38s)]
*  Now, the Palestinians today, they're very disappointed of the process. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1389.38s)]
*  The process has not led to a two-state solution. And the fruits of the peace process is now dry. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1395.38s)]
*  Maybe most of the Palestinians didn't really see it. The situation has deteriorated. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1403.38s)]
*  Instead of the situation being improved, it has actually, on the contrary, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1409.38s)]
*  the number of Jewish settlers in the Palestinian territory has increased from 149,000 in 1991 to today, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1413.38s)]
*  720,000 Jewish settlers living in more than 220 Jewish settlements and so on. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1421.38s)]
*  So now, internally, we have actually had a Palestinian National Council meeting. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1428.38s)]
*  We have had a Central Council meeting that has elected a new leadership of the PLO. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1436.38s)]
*  We were hoping that our president, Mahmoud Abbas, has actually, last September or the September before, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1441.38s)]
*  he announced that we are ready for elections and we did prepare the ground. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1449.38s)]
*  Unfortunately, Israeli elections took more than expected and Palestinians, we were not allowed to vote in Jerusalem. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1454.38s)]
*  Now, the issue for the internal Palestinian front, unity is a must, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1461.38s)]
*  whether through signed agreements or whether through the elections. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1468.38s)]
*  Now, the PLO has always and will continue to be the last reference for the Palestinians, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1474.38s)]
*  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1482.38s)]
*  As long as there is a refugee problem, the Palestinian, the PLO, has to continue to live [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1485.38s)]
*  because that is the real representative of the people. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1492.38s)]
*  Now, the question is, again, which has to do with what you said, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1495.38s)]
*  can we really have elections for the Palestinian National Council? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1499.38s)]
*  The Palestinian National Council is a coalition. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1503.38s)]
*  It's not really you don't elect the members of the Palestinian National Council. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1506.38s)]
*  You don't elect them. They come from elected bodies. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1511.38s)]
*  For example, women's union elects its own representative to the legislative council, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1514.38s)]
*  to the BNC, to the Palestinian National Council, teachers union, doctors union, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1521.38s)]
*  but I've seen different factions have a quota. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1525.38s)]
*  So the BNC is not really, you cannot elect the BNC. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1528.38s)]
*  The BNC is a coalition of elected bodies, whether factions or trade unions or independent bodies that we have to agree about. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1533.38s)]
*  Now, where do we go from here? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1543.38s)]
*  And I think that if the election takes place, you have two scenarios for the Palestinians. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1545.38s)]
*  You have one scenario, which is to tell the Israelis, come and take over as an occupying power. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1554.38s)]
*  You are responsible for the daily lives of the people. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1559.38s)]
*  Or the other option is that 140 countries have recognized Palestine as a state. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1563.38s)]
*  And all what you need to do is manifestation of the state on the ground and say, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1569.38s)]
*  here we are, we want to defend it. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1573.38s)]
*  By all means, Palestinians, whether in the diaspora, in Gaza, in the West Bank, in the refugee camps of Lebanon, Syria, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1576.38s)]
*  we all agree on one thing, which is the PLO. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1584.38s)]
*  It's agreed upon. There are, of course, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, who are not members of the PLO, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1588.38s)]
*  but we are ready to engage them on the basis of what? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1593.38s)]
*  On the basis of accepting the political platform of the PLO, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1597.38s)]
*  because that is the international counterpart to the agreement with Israel. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1600.38s)]
*  That is the counterpart to the international community. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1605.38s)]
*  And that is the counterpart that has been recognized by the whole world that it is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1608.38s)]
*  So therefore, I think what the Palestinians are ready to accept is already the minimum justice for them. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1615.38s)]
*  The PLO continue to be. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1623.38s)]
*  The Palestinian Authority should transfer itself from it being an interim authority to it becoming a state, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1625.38s)]
*  whether under occupation or a state in the making, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1633.38s)]
*  and that the whole national liberation movement that has not achieved its goal, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1637.38s)]
*  it's going to continue its struggle through the different means in particularly [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1643.38s)]
*  and in reference to peaceful means of resistance that Palestinians have adopted as a program, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1648.38s)]
*  which, by the way, is agreed upon between all Palestinian factions, except maybe one. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1654.38s)]
*  13, 14 different Palestinian factions have accepted this. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1660.38s)]
*  All right. Can we move to Aaron from here? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1665.38s)]
*  Oh, thanks, Mr. Prime Minister. It's great to see you. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1668.38s)]
*  You remind me it's been 20 years since the Camp David Summit this month. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1672.38s)]
*  And on an additional 10 from Madrid and stunning 30 years, which is a long time. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1677.38s)]
*  I have two questions for you. They're not easy ones. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1685.38s)]
*  But I think they're important to ask. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1689.38s)]
*  Number one, you know, in the modern period, I don't think there's a precedent for a movement, a national movement, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1693.38s)]
*  negotiating its way out of occupation and building the institutions of self-government. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1700.38s)]
*  I've thought about it. I've looked at the historical parallels and examples. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1707.38s)]
*  I think what the Palestinian people are doing is basically unprecedented. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1712.38s)]
*  At the same time, most national movements that succeed [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1718.38s)]
*  at one point or another develop coherent strategies. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1725.38s)]
*  And it seems to me that the Palestinian National Movement is now more divided than ever. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1730.38s)]
*  And I wonder, is it? And again, I wonder as a friend, not as a critic, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1736.38s)]
*  whether or not aspirations and expectations to achieve statehood [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1742.38s)]
*  are realistic without a cohesion. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1748.38s)]
*  Call it one gun, one authority, one negotiating position. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1755.38s)]
*  Because without that, it seems to me, how do you maintain the respect and legitimacy [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1760.38s)]
*  of the vast majority of Palestinians, let alone your neighbors? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1766.38s)]
*  That's my first question. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1771.38s)]
*  Yes, by all means. You are 100 percent right. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1779.38s)]
*  We are really, of course, it's good to see you as well. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1784.38s)]
*  But we are really in a very ironic situation. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1788.38s)]
*  We are a national liberation movement that has not achieved its goals. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1793.38s)]
*  And we are an authority that is building institutions on the road to building a state. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1799.38s)]
*  And you have the international community fully supporting us financially, politically, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1806.38s)]
*  and others in order for us to be able to build a state. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1811.38s)]
*  Now, building a state and having an agreement with Israel, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1815.38s)]
*  that was the opening door for the national liberation movement. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1821.38s)]
*  But still, the process is ongoing. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1827.38s)]
*  This national liberation movement has not achieved its goals. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1829.38s)]
*  The problem is that, quote unquote, the Palestinian freedom fighters became civil servants. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1834.38s)]
*  And so therefore, there is some sort of change of mentality with certain people. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1842.38s)]
*  But still, the Palestinian political factions did not evaporate at all. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1848.38s)]
*  They are still there. And I think the spirit of resistance is still there in the hearts of people. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1853.38s)]
*  Now, you are right that the strategy in general, the strategy goal for the Palestinian struggle did not change. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1858.38s)]
*  What has changed is the tools of how to reach the goal. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1870.38s)]
*  The goal is about to Palestinian independent state on the borders of 1967 with East Jerusalem as its capital [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1876.38s)]
*  and the right of Palestinian refugees for return. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1883.38s)]
*  This has been the goal since 1998, as Zaha has referred to. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1885.38s)]
*  Now, the issue here is what has been changed is the tools. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1890.38s)]
*  We have gone from armed struggle into negotiations and from negotiations into state building. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1897.38s)]
*  And the state building is now facing a serious problem because the geographic base of this state is eroded gradually [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1904.38s)]
*  by the colonization process that Israel is employing. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1913.38s)]
*  Now, you are 100% right also that in order for us to be a responsible authority and a united front, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1917.38s)]
*  one machine gun, one policeman, one authority has to be there. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1930.38s)]
*  And that is why we have been working hard in order for us to have a Palestinian-Palestinian reconciliation and ending the split. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1935.38s)]
*  We did try hard with Gaza. We signed four agreements with Hamas, two agreements in Cairo, one in Doha, one in a shelter refugee camp. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1946.38s)]
*  And also we called for elections. Hamas recently accepted to go for elections. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1955.38s)]
*  We did work hard for that to happen. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1961.38s)]
*  Unfortunately, the Palestinians have not been able to do it because of the issue of Jerusalem. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1964.38s)]
*  So the aspirations of the people under all these circumstances, I think, are there. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1970.38s)]
*  The right of self-determination to people, it will never be shaken under any circumstances. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1978.38s)]
*  I remember very well when President Obama asked our president Mahmoud Abbas in the last meeting that has taken place, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1984.38s)]
*  he told him, Mr. President, what if there will be a peace process? What will you do with Gaza? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=1992.38s)]
*  Do you represent Gaza? Of course, we do represent Gaza because the negotiations all takes place under the auspices of the BLO. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2000.38s)]
*  It's not the Palestinian Authority that is negotiating. It's the BLO that is really negotiating. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2009.38s)]
*  So by all means, the strategy for Palestine, the goal continue to be the same. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2014.38s)]
*  There are new factors that has been taken in consideration. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2021.38s)]
*  And if this annexation is going to take place, for sure, the goal will not be the same. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2025.38s)]
*  For sure, there has been a serious departure from where we were heading into a new totally different direction. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2034.38s)]
*  And I am worried that what will change is not only the goal, but what might change is the tool as well. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2043.38s)]
*  Because today we are in control of the situation. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2052.38s)]
*  The question for us with no money, with no political hope, with all these sort of miserable conditions of poverty, unemployment, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2055.38s)]
*  all these sort of internal factors that really lead to desperation, desperate situation. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2064.38s)]
*  How long can you control the situation? [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2070.38s)]
*  So therefore, the security dimension of the internal Palestinian dynamic is very dangerous, not only for us, but for Israel as well and for the region. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2073.38s)]
*  And that is why Jordan was so important player in the preventing annexation and the statement by King Abdullah. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2083.38s)]
*  With all respect, it was a wonderful statement. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2093.38s)]
*  Jordan stood steady because the annexation is not only a threat for Palestine, it's a regional threat. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2096.38s)]
*  It's an erosion of two states. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2104.38s)]
*  And also, I think it will lead to a new dynamic, a new direction of things. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2106.38s)]
*  And my worry is that it will also lead, it might lead to a new tools of resistance. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2112.38s)]
*  Mohamed, thank you. One additional question, and that involves the very difficult challenge of self-criticism. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2119.38s)]
*  I mean, I've been gone from this process mercifully for 17 years now, and I spent a lot of that time looking in the mirror and trying to understand what the United States has done wrong. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2128.38s)]
*  And we have a lot to answer for. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2142.38s)]
*  And I made my views very clear on this. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2146.38s)]
*  There are many Israelis who have also looked in the mirror and tried to come to terms with the mistakes the negotiators, I mean, what mistakes they made. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2150.38s)]
*  Everybody makes mistakes. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2159.38s)]
*  There's not a political entity or organization in human history that hasn't made serious errors in terms of articulating strategy. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2161.38s)]
*  So my question is very simple. If you had to look back, and you've been associated with this process longer than I, if you had to look back and you had to identify the one fundamental transgression or mistake, the serious nature that Palestinians have made, what would that mistake be? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2171.38s)]
*  I have written a book of 261 pages of what sort of mistakes did we do in the last 100 years? [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2198.38s)]
*  I summarize them in five mistakes. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2208.38s)]
*  First, we didn't have a parliament. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2212.38s)]
*  The Legislative Council that was proposed by the British mandate was never fulfilled. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2217.38s)]
*  Second, the fragmentation of Palestinian leadership between 48 and 65. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2224.38s)]
*  Third important issue that most of the contributors to this, including Dr. Azhar Hassan, they realized they counted signing Oslo agreement was a mistake. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2231.38s)]
*  Why? Because it was an interim agreement. It was not a comprehensive agreement. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2249.38s)]
*  And I think one of the most serious mistakes that we allowed this split or this split has been allowed, not we. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2255.38s)]
*  This split between West Bank and Gaza, Hamas and Fatah. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2263.38s)]
*  I think this is a crucial vital mistake that is that continue to be there unless we handle this. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2266.38s)]
*  Now, also remember one important thing. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2273.38s)]
*  I think also this sort of trust of the United States is a big mistake, to be frank with you, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2276.38s)]
*  because we in every analysis that tells us we know this unique relationship between Washington and Tel Aviv, we know that. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2284.38s)]
*  And therefore, to have the United States enjoying a monopoly over the process for 30 years, this should not have been allowed. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2293.38s)]
*  And also to every time keep giving Bees a chance in the same way, in the same on the same negotiating table. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2302.38s)]
*  That was not a very wise thing to do. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2311.38s)]
*  There has to be one important thing, which I think we did compromise at a certain time. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2314.38s)]
*  One, a recipe for a successful Bees process has to do with the following. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2321.38s)]
*  You have to have an agreed upon terms of reference. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2326.38s)]
*  You and Marwan and Zahano very well that Madrid was possible because James Baker made it possible, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2330.38s)]
*  because there was an agreed upon terms of reference, because there was an agreed upon letter of invitation. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2339.38s)]
*  That's one. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2346.38s)]
*  Second, I think the moment we realized that instead of having confidence building measures, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2348.38s)]
*  Israel was from day one employing confidence destruction measures. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2356.38s)]
*  And I think that we should have noticed at very early time that the peace and colonization cannot go hand in hand. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2361.38s)]
*  Israel wanted to use the peace process as a camouflage for the continuation of the colonization program. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2371.38s)]
*  And also, I think the time frame there has to be, you know, Rabin used to say there are no secret dates. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2379.38s)]
*  Yesterday, General Gantz, he said about annexation, there are no secret dates. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2389.38s)]
*  Look, with the peace process, there has to be secret dates because it has to do with the lives of people. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2395.38s)]
*  We have been in this process, as you rightly said, at the very beginning for 30 years now. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2402.38s)]
*  Maybe this is the longest peace process in history. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2407.38s)]
*  And the most important thing is intentions. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2410.38s)]
*  We know, and I remember very well, and you do, Aaron, you remember that very well, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2415.38s)]
*  when Ishak Rabin was leaving Madrid and the plane to Tel Aviv airport, he said, I will keep them talking for 10 years. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2422.38s)]
*  We have been talking for 30 years. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2432.38s)]
*  So Shamir, Ishak Shamir, the intentions from day one, the intentions were not there. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2435.38s)]
*  How many rounds of talks did our President Mahmoud Abbas conduct with Prime Minister Netanyahu? [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2443.38s)]
*  Three rounds of 16 hours in Washington, in Sharm el-Sheikh, and at his house in West Jerusalem. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2451.38s)]
*  No way, no room for compromise. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2457.38s)]
*  Netanyahu never wanted to talk about borders, settlements, Jerusalem, refugees, water. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2461.38s)]
*  Netanyahu only wanted to speak about one single thing, which is security, security, security, without really wanted to talk about. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2466.38s)]
*  So these are indicative of indications of things that we should have not compromised. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2474.38s)]
*  Let me remind again the audience that you can ask questions. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2481.38s)]
*  You can write them to middle east one word at ceip.org. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2488.38s)]
*  Dr. Shtey, I have a question and Zaha also has a question, but I want to press you a little bit on some different scenario. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2493.38s)]
*  A lot of people are starting to say the two-state and you know, I'm talking of course as a two-stater just like you are. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2505.38s)]
*  A lot of people are saying the two-state paradigm has allowed Israel so far to keep on swallowing more of the land while the international community is sticking to a paradigm that is not working and has no mechanism of being implemented. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2513.38s)]
*  What is wrong about shifting this paradigm to a rights based approach that the international community today, particularly in a George Floyd environment, understands very well? [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2532.38s)]
*  What is wrong about the Palestinian saying to the international community, if you don't want to give us a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2545.38s)]
*  then we are going to ask for equal political rights within the state we live in and you as an international community cannot say no to a Palestinian state and no to equal rights because if you do that, you are saying yes to apartheid. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2557.38s)]
*  What is wrong with this argument from the PNA perspective? [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2574.38s)]
*  And in the interest of time, I want to have Zaha ask a completely different question and allow you a chance to respond. Please, Zaha. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2579.38s)]
*  Just to amplify your question as well, Marwan, we hear a lot in the U.S. what do the Palestinians want? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2588.38s)]
*  What do the Palestinians want? Because they hear one thing from civil society and the diaspora communities that engage with the solidarity community in the U.S. and elsewhere. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2599.38s)]
*  And they hear another thing from the Palestinian Authority or PLO representatives and getting around a singular message would be extremely helpful in terms of getting policymakers to engage on the Palestinian question. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2609.38s)]
*  Right now, policymakers don't know what Palestinians want, so I just want to amplify that question from Marwan. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2627.38s)]
*  My question, though, has to do with the COVID-19 response. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2633.38s)]
*  I mean, there has been a surge in COVID-19 cases in the occupied Palestinian territories before the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2638.38s)]
*  On May 22nd, there were around 600 total cases that had been reported in Palestine. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2646.38s)]
*  And yesterday, in just one day, there's 322 new cases, and we're starting to see more people in ICU and more people dying, including a 40-year-old, I think, yesterday. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2652.38s)]
*  So, you know, with the PA stopping coordination with the Israelis, this obviously is going to impact, you know, the health care coordination between the PA and Israel. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2663.38s)]
*  And there's a lot of concern about what this might mean for Palestinians on the ground that are going to be facing this surge in the pandemic around them. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2673.38s)]
*  So if you could address that as well. And also the PA's financial health writ large is in question right now. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2684.38s)]
*  And I know public sector employees aren't being paid, including health workers. So, you know, please address that as well. Thank you. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2691.38s)]
*  Okay. Yes, thank you, Marwan. It's fine. You repeated that question. It's good. Because look, at the end of the day, frankly, and here, I don't want to speak about myself as a prime minister. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2698.38s)]
*  As a Palestinian, what do I really want? I want a solution. If Israel is ready for one state, we are ready for one state. If Israel is ready for two states, we are ready for two states. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2712.38s)]
*  The issue is not about the international community, because my dear Marwan, look, if we go to the international community and say, well, look, it's about rights. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2727.38s)]
*  We want equal rights in one state. Help us with that. They will say, okay, because the international community has been saying, okay, we will help you on two states. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2736.38s)]
*  Today, the two states, as I was saying earlier, it does enjoy. You know, how long did it take us to create a consensus about two states? [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2747.38s)]
*  55 years. It took us 55 years to build a national consensus on two states, to build an Arab consensus on two states. If Gaddafi is still alive, he doesn't like it. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2757.38s)]
*  But all the Arab leaders of today, they do support this idea of two states. Europe, again, so the issue is really not what I said earlier, is Israel does not want two states. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2769.38s)]
*  Israel does not want state. Israel, obviously, is into a creeping annexation from our side, the Palestinian public, not Palestinian leadership. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2785.38s)]
*  Today, if you go to the Palestinians and ask them, do you want one state or two states? I don't think that average Palestinian, you know, wants really to make a big difference on whether this or that. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2796.38s)]
*  Palestinians are sick of the situation. Palestinians, they want a solution. Maybe Palestinians in the diaspora, most of them are from 1948 proper, but they did also at a certain time. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2809.38s)]
*  People are saying, look, you have been telling us for 30 years that this is going to work. It is not working. And why don't you try the other approach? That is where your question comes from. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2824.38s)]
*  The issue is about real politic. The issue is about what Israel wants to maintain itself as. The Israelis, they want to keep a majority of Jews in the state of Israel, and they want to create a democracy for themselves. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2837.38s)]
*  This one state about rights, this is a total erosion of the Zionist program, which we know that the Israelis will not accept. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2859.38s)]
*  So therefore, therefore, I am telling you as an average Palestinian, with one state I'm ready to live with, with two states I'm ready to live with. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2869.38s)]
*  But what is more realistic to happen is the partition of land and more than equal rights. So the issue of national liberation versus internal colonialism. That is what the way I see it. That is the way we see it. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2880.38s)]
*  Now, also, of course, if the Palestinians, whom we promised them to solve the issue of refugees on coming back to the state of Palestine, getting out of this misery of Lebanon and Syria, of course they will be happy to see that happening. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2899.38s)]
*  But the problem is that 30 years have not materialized peace and 30 years of negotiations did not really see, did not show the average Palestinian the fruits of the peace process. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2917.38s)]
*  And that is where the real frustration comes from. Now, coming to the question on Corona, the difference between the way we handle, it's we're the same people and the same prime minister who handled the same wave and handling this other wave. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2930.38s)]
*  The difference is the following. First of all, in the first wave of the Corona, our policemen were on the borders of 67. We were controlling entry points, and we were controlling exit points. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2945.38s)]
*  We were controlling the daily movement of workers into Israel. We have 200,000 Palestinians working in Israel. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2960.38s)]
*  So now we don't control that at all. But the moment we stopped coordination, security coordination with the Israelis, Israel immediately asked Palestinian police force to leave where they were stationed and the borders of 67 at the entry points and at the exit points. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2970.38s)]
*  Not only that, we were asked to leave by force area C and area B. So the Palestinian police force that is enforcing emergency situation is now in area A. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=2991.38s)]
*  One. Second important issue, this has coincided with the issue of annexation. The whole, the Palestinians were very frustrated of this issue of annexation. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=3005.38s)]
*  They wanted to express their rejection. So there were rallies, demonstrations, and so on, which is about bringing people together. Fighting the Corona is about pushing people away from each other. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=3017.38s)]
*  So we had sort of conflicting really situation in which you want people to rally against annexation and you want people to stay home with health measures and so on. More than that. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=3030.38s)]
*  The system has some loopholes that needs serious coordination, which unfortunately Israel has pushed things in a totally different direction. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=3044.38s)]
*  Now, the main reason for this wave has to do with movement of Palestinians from 1948 proper into the West Bank, especially in the Hebron area, where intermarriages are there, merchants are there, and we have no control over borders. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=3058.38s)]
*  That is why we are moving now. And today we are announcing, starting this Friday, we are announcing a total closure over the West Bank. There will be restricted movement inside the towns. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=3078.38s)]
*  There will be restricted movement between cities, between villages. And actually we are back to square one. This increased numbers of Corona virus patients is not only in Palestine. It is all over the world. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=3091.38s)]
*  I think the day before yesterday, it was a record all over the world. We are not, unfortunately, in a position to control fully our borders. We did control it at the very beginning when we were able to station our police at the entry points, at the checkpoints. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=3104.38s)]
*  And with 200,000 Palestinians commuting on daily basis, it is impossible to control it. Simply because, as I said, we were there and now we are not there. So our force, police force, it did shrink into the cities only, instead of them being at the entry points and at the exit points. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=3122.38s)]
*  I hope we will be able to re-control the situation. But again, this virus, nobody knows where is it. Nobody has seen it. There is no vaccine for it. There is no medicine for it. And we have to live with it. The numbers are worrying. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=3145.38s)]
*  I agree with you. But also the reality that has caused this is unfortunately a very, it's 100% political reality and not a failure on our side of this wave and a success on our side in the first wave. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=3159.38s)]
*  Dr. Shteya, Khalil Shikaki has just published his latest poll. And there seems to be a lot of support among Palestinians for armed resistance. What is the PNA's position on this? And aren't you sort of concerned about things deteriorating from a security point of view? [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=3175.38s)]
*  What if another question that came in is what if annexation doesn't take place? What strategy do you have to ensure that you don't go back to a prolonged status quo in which Israel keeps on swallowing more of the land? [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=3200.38s)]
*  And I think probably we have time for you to answer these and for any final comments on your part. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=3215.38s)]
*  Yes. Look, Marwan, again, this opinion poll, people, frankly, they want a solution. And under any circumstances, we are not going to go into bloodshed. This is not the answer. It's a very dangerous situation. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=3224.38s)]
*  I know the situation is a fluid and I know it is there is a serious frustration with the house demolitions, with all these land expropriations, with the 5000 Palestinians in Israeli presence, with 83 checkpoints, with the siege on Gaza, with all these measures. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=3244.38s)]
*  They are very frustrating. I know that. And people, they want an answer. And we are telling we have been telling the people peace is the answer. Unfortunately, we don't have a peace partner. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=3263.38s)]
*  But under any circumstances, this is a situation in which we will not allow that to happen. This is a very dangerous approach. And we will continue to seek passive resistance, peaceful, passive resistance. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=3274.38s)]
*  Now, how do you break the status quo? Look, I think it is important that we should break the status quo. The status quo is unsustainable and it is going to lead into dangerous situations. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=3288.38s)]
*  There are many things. One of them has to do with us. Other things it has to do with the international community. We called for an international conference. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=3302.38s)]
*  We are ready for peace. We are ready to sit down and talk. And we are ready to start negotiations from where they ended on the basis of the signed agreements. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=3312.38s)]
*  We are ready to accept an invitation by the Quartet. This is a situation in which you have to, as I said earlier, we need to move from a paradigm shift from bilateral to multilateral. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=3325.38s)]
*  That is, I think, the answer to this problem. We have to move from crisis management. The 30 years were not about negotiations. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=3338.38s)]
*  The 30 years, I don't know how many hours of negotiations were there, hundreds and thousands of hours, but it's not 30 years of really negotiations. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=3348.38s)]
*  It was 30 years of managing the crisis. And I think that is what needs to be broken. The international community is responsible for this. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=3358.38s)]
*  And I think the international community, they have to help us break the status quo either by recognizing Palestine or by bringing the parties into a multilateral forum. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJsup-5E7s&t=3366.38s)]
