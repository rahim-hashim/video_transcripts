# Wehrey on Building Libya's Security Sector
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [October 09, 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE)
*  This policy outlook really deals with building Libya's security institutions, meaning how [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=0.0s)]
*  does the international community and the Libyan government train, equip, and really build [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=15.9s)]
*  from the ground up Libya's army and police and the institutions that oversee those organizations. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=21.54s)]
*  What really inspired me to pursue this outlook was a number of trips to Libya since the revolution [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=29.24s)]
*  where it became apparent to me that the security situation was getting worse. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=36.16s)]
*  And there was a real hunger by the Libyan government and especially by outside powers, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=40.36s)]
*  the US and NATO, for solutions, for policy recommendations. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  Building Libya's security institutions is important because the absence of a functioning [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=50.94s)]
*  army has really created a security vacuum in the country over the past year that is [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=57.22s)]
*  impeding the country's democratic transition. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=62.7s)]
*  The militias are really their own law. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=65.46000000000001s)]
*  They have filled in the security vacuum. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=69.38s)]
*  In some cases they act as sort of neighborhood watch programs, but in other cases they've [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=71.7s)]
*  gotten into criminal enterprise. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=76.02s)]
*  They've pursued political agendas. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=78.46000000000001s)]
*  Recently they've stopped the oil production in the country. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=80.9s)]
*  And there's a real urgency to get the situation under control, to bolster the police and the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=85.1s)]
*  army so the country can move ahead. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=90.1s)]
*  Libya's problems are spreading across the region. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=92.33999999999999s)]
*  The country's poorest borders have enabled the free flow of arms to the south, to Mali. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=95.22s)]
*  Libyan arms are showing up in Gaza and even in Syria. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=101.66s)]
*  So getting a handle on the situation is crucial, not only for Libya's future but for the surrounding [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=105.06s)]
*  region. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=110.13999999999999s)]
*  We offer prescriptions for the United States and NATO in terms of how to train and equip [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=111.3s)]
*  the new Libyan army, how to equip the police, how to go about vetting recruits, how to ensure [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=117.97999999999999s)]
*  that there's civilian control and oversight over these institutions. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=124.14s)]
*  But we also argue for a political track. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=128.82s)]
*  In many cases the militia problem is really a political problem. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  And so we argue that there has to be a process of national dialogue. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=136.12s)]
*  There has to be a constitution. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=139.9s)]
*  There has to be a functioning parliament for these militias to feel like they have inclusion [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=141.74s)]
*  in the country. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  And so these two tracks have to work together. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU_E8bQfmwE&t=148.10000000000002s)]
