# Can Lebanon's New Government Save the Country From its Crises?
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [September 17, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc)
*  Lebanon finally has a government after 13 months of waiting. The last government [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=0.0s)]
*  had resigned at the aftermath of Beirut's horrific port explosion on August 4th [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=6.0s)]
*  2020 which left more than 200 people dead, more than 6,000 injured and blew up [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=10.32s)]
*  half the city. The reasons for this delay in government formation are both [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  external and internal. Internally the animosity between the political [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=22.8s)]
*  leadership, their unwillingness to compromise on issues they consider of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=29.2s)]
*  strategic interest to them, in other words placing the interests of [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=34.08s)]
*  their own particular ambitions over the interests, the broader interests of the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=41.44s)]
*  country, meant that decision-making on government formation was blocked [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=45.2s)]
*  repeatedly as they fought over portfolios over who has the right to which [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  ministry. In short there was no discussion of what kind of a strategic [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=58.16s)]
*  vision is needed to get the country out of the multiple crisis it is facing and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=64.16s)]
*  which for the first time are threatening the very identity of this country. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=70.36s)]
*  Externally the vested interests of regional powers, various regional powers [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  in particular Iran, in local political parties particularly Hezbollah, has meant [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=81.92s)]
*  that Lebanon has also become one pawn, one more pawn, and the regional chessboard [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=89.84s)]
*  and remains hostage to decisions that are being taken elsewhere. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=96.08s)]
*  The potential for this government to undertake the kind of serious medium to [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=105.28s)]
*  long-term reforms that would get the country out of the political quagmire [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=111.72s)]
*  it's in and the economic quagmire that it's in and on the road to recovery are [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=116.4s)]
*  almost non-existent. In part this is because the way the government was [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=122.44s)]
*  formed ensures that it has elements of its own implosion embedded within it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=129.72s)]
*  The government throughout this whole period of government formation, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=135.68s)]
*  discussion between the leadership was never at a strategic level as to how to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=140.32s)]
*  get the country out of the mess it's in, rather they focused on how they can [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  maximize their gains within the system and who gets what ministry literally. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  So the appointment of ministers to this particular government has been on that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=156.2s)]
*  basis. There are some competent ministers however most of their political [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  decisions will be privy to the wishes of that particular of the leadership that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=167.0s)]
*  named them. So the chances, the prospects for this government are more likely to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=172.72s)]
*  stem the collapse, hold hopefully the elections on time in 2022. Lebanon is [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=179.96s)]
*  looking towards a parliamentary election as well as a municipal and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  presidential election so the hope is that the government will actually carry [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=196.16s)]
*  these elections out in time and then after that we shall see. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkVXEiHRFRc&t=199.96s)]
