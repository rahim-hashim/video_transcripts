# Wehrey on Ending Libya's Civil War
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [September 26, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ)
*  Three years after the fall of Gaddafi, Libya is in the throes of a bitter civil war. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=0.0s)]
*  It's essentially split between two camps, two warring camps. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=13.0s)]
*  In the east, there's the forces aligned with Operation Dignity, which are comprised of [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=17.3s)]
*  eastern tribes, disaffected military units, and federalists. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=22.64s)]
*  In the west, there's a coalition of militias from the powerful town of Misrata and Islamists. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=27.32s)]
*  They've each declared their own parliament, they each have their own government, they [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=34.52s)]
*  each have their own army. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=37.68s)]
*  This really creates a quandary for international assistance because there's two claims for [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=40.0s)]
*  legitimacy in this divided country. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  The international community has recognized the parliament in the east, in Tobruk, and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=48.44s)]
*  there's talks underway through the United Nations to try to arrange some ceasefire. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=53.76s)]
*  The situation in Libya has really been compounded by interference by regional states. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=58.76s)]
*  Libya has become a battleground, a proxy battleground, between Egypt and the United Arab Emirates [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=64.28s)]
*  on the one hand, who are backing the forces in the east, the Dignity forces, and Qatar, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=69.24s)]
*  and Turkey, and possibly Sudan, who are backing the forces in the west, the so-called Don [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=75.36s)]
*  forces. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=79.88s)]
*  Now, what's essential to moving the situation forward is for these states to back off, to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=81.0s)]
*  stop sending arms and funding to the respective militia allies in the country. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=85.32s)]
*  Now, beyond a ceasefire, Libya needs an inclusive government. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=90.44s)]
*  It needs to expand its cabinet to include people from the west, from Misrata. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=94.11999999999999s)]
*  It needs a power-sharing formula. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=100.72s)]
*  But more importantly, it needs to build inclusive security institutions. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=102.67999999999999s)]
*  It needs to start demobilizing the militias. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  It needs to offer jobs and education opportunities to the young men who are filling the militia's [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=108.8s)]
*  ranks. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=114.19999999999999s)]
*  It needs to really recreate its entire army and its police in such a way that it's inclusive [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=116.19999999999999s)]
*  of all Libyans from different tribes and backgrounds. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  Libya's descent as a failed state will not just affect its own people, but it will affect [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=126.91999999999999s)]
*  the surrounding region. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=131.64s)]
*  There's a real danger that this country could become a base for foreign jihadists. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=133.28s)]
*  We know that Libyan weapons are showing up across the region. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=138.2s)]
*  They've destabilized Mali. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=141.84s)]
*  They're showing up in Gaza, in Syria. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=143.8s)]
*  So this is a crisis that affects not just the Libyan people, but the entire region. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kLkV5xuZQ&t=147.0s)]
