# Muasher on Jordan's Syria Policy
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [June 10, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2YEekqwkc)
*  The Syrian crisis is putting Jordan in an extremely difficult position. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2YEekqwkc&t=0.0s)]
*  On one hand, the continuation of the regime is resulting in severe economic, political, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2YEekqwkc&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  and security issues for the country, as well as an influx of refugees. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2YEekqwkc&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  On the other hand, an end to the conflict might either bring in a preservation of the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2YEekqwkc&t=23.66s)]
*  current regime, of which Jordan is highly critical, or the introduction of radical [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2YEekqwkc&t=28.78s)]
*  forces that would also pose a threat to Jordan's security. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2YEekqwkc&t=33.94s)]
*  It is not in Jordan's interest for the current Assad regime to stay on top. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2YEekqwkc&t=38.5s)]
*  Jordan has been highly critical of this regime even before the crisis, and any preservation [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2YEekqwkc&t=43.58s)]
*  of the regime is likely to lead to retaliation by the Syrian government against Jordan. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2YEekqwkc&t=49.260000000000005s)]
*  On the other hand, the introduction of radical forces, which may end up ruling Syria even [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2YEekqwkc&t=56.46s)]
*  in an interim way, will also pose security threats that the country cannot withstand. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2YEekqwkc&t=62.14s)]
*  The refugee crisis also is posing a number of threats to the country. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2YEekqwkc&t=69.34s)]
*  Already there are more than 1.3 million Syrian residents, refugees or otherwise, in the country, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2YEekqwkc&t=73.94s)]
*  out of a total population of 7.5 million. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2YEekqwkc&t=79.46000000000001s)]
*  That means more than 18% of the population is already comprised of Syrian refugees. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2YEekqwkc&t=82.94s)]
*  Jordan has few options but to, on one hand, work with the international community to encourage [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2YEekqwkc&t=89.7s)]
*  a political process, maybe work behind the scenes in efforts to support the moderate [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2YEekqwkc&t=94.7s)]
*  elements of the opposition, and also call upon the international community to increase [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2YEekqwkc&t=104.22s)]
*  its aid to refugees and to the Jordanian government and support it as it faces such a difficult situation. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2YEekqwkc&t=110.66s)]
