Video Description: In a crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood, their supporters and other dissenters, an Egyptian court put 638 suspected Islamists on trial for murder or attempted murder during riots last year. A day earlier, more than 500 suspected supporters of ousted President Morsi were sentenced to death by the same judge. Judy Woodruff talks to Michele Dunne of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

# Dissent in Egypt persists despite mass trials
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [March 25, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0)
*  Finally, tonight, the continuing crackdown in Egypt, this time in the courts. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=0.0s)]
*  Six hundred and thirty-eight suspected Islamists stood trial today on charges of murder or [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=5.68s)]
*  attempted murder during attacks on police stations back in August. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  No defense lawyers were present. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=15.4s)]
*  Yesterday, in a similar scene, more than 500 suspected supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=17.6s)]
*  were sentenced to death. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=23.48s)]
*  We explore these developments with former State Department Middle East Specialist Michelle [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  Dunn. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=29.32s)]
*  She's now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=30.32s)]
*  Welcome back to the NewsHour. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=33.2s)]
*  Thank you, Judy. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=34.2s)]
*  Michelle Dunn, what were the charges that the court said these people were guilty of? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=35.2s)]
*  Well, they said they were guilty of rioting that led to the death of one single police [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=39.84s)]
*  officer. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=45.6s)]
*  And they convicted, as you said, more than 500. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=47.36s)]
*  And there were about 147 of those people in custody. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=50.019999999999996s)]
*  So not all of them. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=53.84s)]
*  Many of them were absent. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=54.84s)]
*  Many of them are at large. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=55.84s)]
*  We're looking at nearly 150 people who could potentially be executed for the death of a [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=57.36000000000001s)]
*  single police officer. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=61.32000000000001s)]
*  And what kind of a trial was it? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=62.56s)]
*  It was less than a day, several hours long, no defense lawyers present. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=64.14s)]
*  There were two very brief sessions, two very brief court sessions over a couple of days, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=68.44s)]
*  I think less than an hour each. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=72.64s)]
*  There were apparently, there were lots of thousands of pages of evidence, but they were [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=75.44s)]
*  not reviewed. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=79.04s)]
*  The defense lawyers couldn't present their arguments. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  It was nothing that you would call a trial. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=83.8s)]
*  Who are the people who are being charged? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=87.08s)]
*  If you add it all up, it's over 1,000 people. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=88.75999999999999s)]
*  Who are they? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=90.96s)]
*  Well, by the way, these are not the only cases. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=91.96s)]
*  There are some other mass trials going on. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=94.52s)]
*  Because right now in Egypt, there are close to 19,000 people who have been detained since [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=96.8s)]
*  last summer. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=103.44s)]
*  About 2,500 or so of those are considered to be political leaders of the Brotherhood. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=104.72s)]
*  The rest of them are people who were picked up in demonstrations, demonstrations protesting [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=109.96s)]
*  the removal of former President Morsi last summer. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  So there are all kinds of people. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=118.14s)]
*  They're certainly not all Brotherhood supporters, and there are even small numbers of women [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=120.0s)]
*  and children among them. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  What is this system of putting people on trial, convicting them and sentencing them to death [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=125.5s)]
*  on the same day? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=131.56s)]
*  And we know in the second trial they said the sentencing will come a little later. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=132.56s)]
*  What does this say about the regime and power right now? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=136.68s)]
*  Well, there has been a massive crackdown going on since last summer against particularly [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=140.28s)]
*  the Muslim Brotherhood, but also against other forms of dissent, against some secular activists [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=145.72s)]
*  and journalists and so forth as well. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=150.84s)]
*  Now, we don't really know the sentencing that took place of over 500, whether this was the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=153.36s)]
*  initiative of a particular judge or whether it was a kind of an instruction from higher [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=159.08s)]
*  up in the Egyptian government. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=165.88s)]
*  But I would say there have been a series of steps that have attempted to close down dissent [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  in Egypt. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=171.62s)]
*  You will recall there was the very violent breakup of a sit-in in Cairo in which hundreds [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=172.72s)]
*  and hundreds were killed. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=178.0s)]
*  They passed a law outlawing demonstrations. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=179.56s)]
*  They declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization and said anyone who goes out [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=182.56s)]
*  to demonstrate in favor of Morsi could be sentenced to five years in prison just for [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=186.78s)]
*  showing up at a demonstration. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=191.96s)]
*  And then there have been a number of these harsh sentencings. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=194.12s)]
*  Just recently a group of students at El-Azhar University were given more than 14 years for [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=197.84s)]
*  destroying some university offices in which no one was killed. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=204.52s)]
*  And what effect is all this having, Michelle, on dissent in Egypt? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=208.32s)]
*  Well, it goes on. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=212.08s)]
*  So there are several things going on. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=214.08s)]
*  I mean, there's dissent. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=215.52s)]
*  There are still weekly protests protesting the removal of Morsi despite all these harsh [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=216.52s)]
*  measures. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=222.32s)]
*  And then there is terrorism. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  There are terrorist groups based in the Sinai who are attacking police officers and military [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=228.12s)]
*  officers. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=233.72s)]
*  And there are also a lot of small-scale, what I would call sort of revenge attacks on police [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=234.84s)]
*  officers, just someone on a motorcycle shooting. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=239.2s)]
*  So in Egypt nowadays there's almost a police officer killed every day. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=242.34s)]
*  But if you step out, if you participate in some of these, actually, basically what the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=246.64s)]
*  courts are saying is we're going to come down hard on you. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=251.88s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=255.2s)]
*  I mean, and I think they're sort of waiting to see whether these very harsh sentences [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=256.2s)]
*  will stick. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=261.48s)]
*  Now, there was a big outcry in the international community. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=262.48s)]
*  In Egypt, I think the sentiment about sentencing these hundreds of people to death is much [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=266.28s)]
*  more mixed. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=272.28s)]
*  There are supporters of the military who really want to see the Muslim Brotherhood eradicated, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=273.56s)]
*  and they spoke up in favor of these sentences. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=279.4s)]
*  So is it believed that the courts are going to carry out these sentences? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=281.88s)]
*  Well, there is a possibility of appeal. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=286.08s)]
*  And then the highest Muslim religious leader, the Mufti, has an ability to review these [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=289.08s)]
*  sentences. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=295.0s)]
*  So there are a couple of possibilities that they could be overturned or lessened. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=296.0s)]
*  Michelle Dunn, we thank you very much. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=300.28s)]
*  Thanks, Judy. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69CvJV1VbT0&t=302.84s)]
