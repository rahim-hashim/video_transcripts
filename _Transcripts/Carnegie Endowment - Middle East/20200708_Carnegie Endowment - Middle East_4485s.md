Video Description: In the wake of recent battlefield developments in Libya, regional and global powers are maneuvering for influence and supremacy, with far-reaching implications for Libyan sovereignty, stability, and cohesion. What are the interests and goals of these interveners and what prospects remain for peaceful settlement? How have these states weaponized media narratives to augment their military meddling, and what is the effect both inside Libya and abroad? 

A distinguished panel of scholars will offer insights into Russian, Turkish, Emirati, Egyptian, and French roles, as well as Libyan perspectives on foreign actors.

# The Scramble for Libya:  A Globalized Civil War at Tipping Point
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [July 08, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k)
*  Five. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning from Washington, D.C. I'm Fred Wary, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1.0s)]
*  for International Peace. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=17.0s)]
*  It's my pleasure to welcome you to this livestream panel discussion on the roles of global and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=18.0s)]
*  regional powers in the Libyan Civil War. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=23.5s)]
*  The last several months have seen dramatic battlefield shifts in the Civil War, with [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=26.92s)]
*  the factions on the ground and their foreign backers squaring off in the oil-rich central [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  region. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=35.64s)]
*  Contrary to some early expectations about a peace dividend from the coronavirus pandemic, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=37.040000000000006s)]
*  the fighting has actually escalated with increased flows of advanced weaponry and mercenaries. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  The stakes of this globalized standoff and the scramble for influence extend well beyond [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  the shores of Libya, affecting the entire Mediterranean basin and even the unity of [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=54.63999999999999s)]
*  the NATO alliance. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=59.559999999999995s)]
*  But most of all, it's ordinary Libyans who've suffered the worst of this foreign-backed [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=61.919999999999995s)]
*  conflict in the countless civilian deaths and thousands of displaced, as well as the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=65.96s)]
*  deep ruptures in the country's social fabric. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=71.28s)]
*  Beyond the headlines, a number of deeper questions emerge about the internationalization of this [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=75.44s)]
*  war. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=80.08s)]
*  What kind of settlement and political and economic order in Libya do these foreign countries [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=81.28s)]
*  want? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=86.48s)]
*  What kind of influence do they seek? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=87.6s)]
*  How is Libya linked to these countries' broader goals in other regions, in the Mediterranean, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=89.88s)]
*  Africa, Syria, the NATO alliance? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=95.04s)]
*  And finally, we're often rightly focused on the physical and kinetic aspects of this war, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=98.4s)]
*  but what about the informational realm? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  How has the weaponization of media and social media narratives by these foreign states [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=106.4s)]
*  or local proxies affected the conflict? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=111.68s)]
*  To offer insights into the internationalization of Libya's war, I'm delighted to welcome our [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  distinguished panelists who need no introduction to most of you. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=121.2s)]
*  Dimitri Trenin is the director of Carnegie's Moscow Center, who will speak on Russia. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  Sinan Ogan is a non-resident fellow at Carnegie Europe. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=131.12s)]
*  He'll talk about Turkey. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=134.52s)]
*  Jalal Harshali is a research fellow at the Klingendale Institute, who will cover the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=136.28s)]
*  Emirates, France, and Egypt. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=140.84s)]
*  And Khadija Ramali is an independent Libyan researcher who will close with a discussion [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  of the media war and also Libyan perspectives. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=148.98s)]
*  After brief presentations from our panelists, we will turn to the audience for questions. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=153.2s)]
*  Please submit your questions in the YouTube chat or privately submit them to MiddleEast [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=158.44s)]
*  at ceip.org. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=164.24s)]
*  Dimitri, we'll start with you. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=168.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=169.68s)]
*  Well, thank you very, very much, Fred. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=170.96s)]
*  It's great to be on this great panel. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=172.92s)]
*  Russia is in Libya for, I would say, less than strategic reasons, and yet the reasons [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=177.0s)]
*  are important enough. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=182.64s)]
*  In 2011, Russia let the UN Security Council resolution pass that allowed the use of force [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=184.44s)]
*  in Libya that ultimately led to the ouster of Colonel Gaddafi. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=192.56s)]
*  Russia felt shortchanged, felt deceived by its partners, Western partners, and is now [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=199.20000000000002s)]
*  active to regain a measure of influence in Libya. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  Libya, the intervention, the Western intervention in Libya, is often, was often criticized in [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=214.32s)]
*  Russia. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=222.44s)]
*  The results are believed to be a complete mess, and Russia feels moral, it feels it's [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=223.44s)]
*  morally right for it to come back and see what can be regained in that situation. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=233.84s)]
*  Russia is talking about the future of Libya as a unified country, unified state, a state [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=247.36s)]
*  that should be based on agreement among Libya's three main regions. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=260.24s)]
*  Russia supports international political solution. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=267.56s)]
*  Russia, it staged an ill-fated conference in Moscow at the beginning of the year with [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=272.96s)]
*  the Libyan sides and the Turks. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=281.2s)]
*  This failed. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=285.59999999999997s)]
*  Russia also took part in the Berlin conference. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=287.35999999999996s)]
*  It's been active more recently in trying to achieve some diplomatic success. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=291.71999999999997s)]
*  In the last few days, Russia has announced that it's reopening an embassy for Libya, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  not in Libya, but for Libya. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  And it's conveniently placed in Tunis, from which Russia will talk to both sides in the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=311.16s)]
*  Syrian conflict. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=317.72s)]
*  Russia's reentry in Libya comes against the background of Russian return to the Middle [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=321.48s)]
*  East as an active player after a hiatus of about two decades. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=328.12s)]
*  It's in the Eastern Mediterranean that the bulk of Russian interests are currently concentrated. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=333.96s)]
*  Of course, it's Syria, but Russia is looking also at, as I said, at the potential contracts [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=341.04s)]
*  that it lost with the ouster of Gaddafi in Libya. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=348.6s)]
*  It hopes to restore a relationship with Egypt to its former fairly impressive scope. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=353.91999999999996s)]
*  Many Russians took residence in Cyprus. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=362.47999999999996s)]
*  It's an important financial center for Russia. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=371.2s)]
*  Israel is a country where Russia has a lot of former citizens and keeps very close contacts [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=376.44s)]
*  with the Israeli government. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=384.64000000000004s)]
*  And let's not forget Turkey and also Lebanon. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=386.52000000000004s)]
*  That's the area where Russia is now active. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=390.52000000000004s)]
*  I think there's some considerations of maybe backing up the military facilities that Russia [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=396.40000000000003s)]
*  has currently in Syria by having something in Libya. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=402.84s)]
*  But at this point, I think it's just talk. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=408.03999999999996s)]
*  And Russia has learned the art of contacting and interacting with a lot of players in the [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=412.48s)]
*  Middle East after its reentry. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=422.0s)]
*  It's a very different player in the region compared to the Soviet Union. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=423.8s)]
*  It has become a master of geopolitical connectivity. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=428.44s)]
*  It would deal with really all relevant parties. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=431.72s)]
*  In Libya, Russia is practicing the art of competition and cooperation at the same time, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=437.68s)]
*  which is kind of normal mix for the Russians these days, particularly with the Turks. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=444.88s)]
*  Clearly Russia and Turkey are on opposing sides in Libya. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=450.76s)]
*  And yet Russia and Turkey talk at different levels from the top level to just in the last [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=456.9s)]
*  few hours even or last couple of days. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=462.82s)]
*  The chiefs of the general staff of Turkey and Russia had a conversation about Libya. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=467.97999999999996s)]
*  Russia is prepared to act on the basis of reciprocal interests and tries to strike the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=475.29999999999995s)]
*  right balance for itself. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=481.29999999999995s)]
*  It's learning to manage all those differences with the Turks, as I said, but it finds itself [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=483.98s)]
*  in a coalition of sorts with countries such as Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=488.7s)]
*  Arabia, and even France. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=496.58s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=501.06s)]
*  That sets Russia apart from Russia's policy in Libya, apart from its policy in Syria, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=502.06s)]
*  where it has a military contingent, where it's involved in military operations and all [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=510.54s)]
*  that. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=515.62s)]
*  And to wrap things up, Russia ostensibly is reaching to all parties, but I think the accent [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=516.62s)]
*  that Russia lays on different parties also differs. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=522.14s)]
*  For a period of time, Russia, I think, laid more emphasis on its relations with Field [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=525.26s)]
*  Marshal Haftar. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=531.14s)]
*  But the Field Marshal, I think, disappointed the Russians with his abrupt about face in [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=533.38s)]
*  Moscow during the negotiations that led to the failure of those negotiations. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=539.74s)]
*  And more recently, Russia has been reaching out to another person in Syria's east, Aguilar [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=545.02s)]
*  Saleh, the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies in Tobruk. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=552.14s)]
*  And it's also Russia is also talking to Faraj and his government in Tripoli, but that government [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=560.78s)]
*  is seen as one of the parties to the conflict, not the government of Libya. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=570.26s)]
*  And very finally, I see no significant Libya influence on Russian policy toward that country. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=576.62s)]
*  It's not that there are powerful forces within Libya that have a major impact on how Russia [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=583.5400000000001s)]
*  structures its policy toward that country. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=590.34s)]
*  So let me stop here. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=592.7s)]
*  Great. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=594.9000000000001s)]
*  Thank you for that excellent overview. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=596.9000000000001s)]
*  Sinan. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=599.42s)]
*  Yes, I will follow up with the blueprint laid down by Dimitri and try to explain Turkey's [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=601.42s)]
*  interest in Libya. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=609.9s)]
*  Very shortly, there's a historic dimension to this interest. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=611.38s)]
*  Not only the Ottoman era, but the modern Republic of Turkey has also had a very close relationship [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=616.6999999999999s)]
*  with Libya. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=624.9399999999999s)]
*  Let's remember that during the Gaddafi times when Libya was under the UN embargo, Turkey [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=627.66s)]
*  was one of the few Western countries that continued to have its embassy in Tripoli. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=633.26s)]
*  I know I served there during that time. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=640.2199999999999s)]
*  So that's the historical part. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=643.38s)]
*  Also with a lot of Turkish companies that were active in Libya. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=646.54s)]
*  The reentry again to borrow Dimitri's terminology happened because Libya became also the linchpin [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=652.18s)]
*  to Turkey's Eastern Mediterranean strategy lately. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=660.8599999999999s)]
*  A few words about that. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=665.3399999999999s)]
*  Turkey feels that a number of countries in the Eastern Mediterranean with Egypt, Greece, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=667.6999999999999s)]
*  Cyprus, and Israel are trying to impose their own viewpoint about how the Eastern Mediterranean [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=675.54s)]
*  should be partitioned. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=682.14s)]
*  And Turkey's been pushing back against that. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=684.06s)]
*  And it found an ally in Libya with the government in Tripoli, the Saraj government, and ended [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=686.66s)]
*  up signing in November of last year an agreement with that government over the delimitation [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=693.74s)]
*  of the maritime borders, which allowed Turkey to break the diplomatic isolation they were [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=700.74s)]
*  facing in the Eastern Mediterranean. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=706.66s)]
*  But as a key pro-call to the acquiescence by Tripoli to that agreement, there was a [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=709.1800000000001s)]
*  request for Turkey to provide military support, which at the time the Tripoli government was [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=716.9s)]
*  under siege by the Haftar forces. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=723.14s)]
*  So the Turkish military assistance did rise up to the occasion in a way and was so successful [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=727.26s)]
*  and perhaps surprisingly successful to turn the dynamics on the ground. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=736.7s)]
*  So the initial approach of the policymakers in Ankara was to do this military investment [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=742.5s)]
*  to protect Tripoli, to prevent Haftar forces from seizing Tripoli, from ousting the Saraj [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=749.66s)]
*  government and from also triggering a humanitarian disaster in Tripoli. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=757.06s)]
*  Not only was that accomplished, but with this, and I would say smart intervention, where [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=762.2199999999999s)]
*  Turkey borrowed a page from Russian policy in Syria. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=767.9799999999999s)]
*  This smart intervention with a minimal amount of military engagement, but a smart engagement, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=773.02s)]
*  assets like armed drones, Turkey was able to overturn the dynamics and in a way, maybe [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=781.62s)]
*  surprising even some people in Ankara, it led to the unraveling of the Haftar coalition [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=791.1s)]
*  in quite a surprising short span of time. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=798.22s)]
*  So today Turkey finds itself reconsidering its options in Syria. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=802.58s)]
*  And today it's not only any more about protecting Tripoli, that was the initial objective, but [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=807.42s)]
*  it's more about how Turkey could position itself strategically in Libya as part of this [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=813.5s)]
*  grander strategy of expanding its regional footprint, including in the area of security [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=818.9399999999999s)]
*  and military. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=824.74s)]
*  Now, when we look at this Turkish ambition, we've already seen signs of that with the [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=825.74s)]
*  military cooperation with Qatar and established forward presence in Qatar, in Somalia, Turkey's [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=831.82s)]
*  acquisition of an aircraft carrier from Spain, which was supposed to carry the F-35s. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=839.5s)]
*  Now that Turkey is not anymore going to get the F-35s, it's probably going to be armed [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=845.74s)]
*  drones. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=852.7s)]
*  So there's already, there had already been a strategy of Turkey acquiring a bigger regional [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=853.86s)]
*  footprint. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=860.42s)]
*  And now Libya is part of that plan. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=861.86s)]
*  So there are negotiations for a Turkish military outpost there, a permanent presence in the [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=865.54s)]
*  Vatia airbase, firstly, which was bombed a few days ago, incidentally. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=873.8199999999999s)]
*  So that's the objective in Ankara has somewhat shifted to allow Turkey to acquire that strategic [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=881.54s)]
*  presence in Libya. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=889.3399999999999s)]
*  Now, of course, and I'm sure we're going to talk a bit more about this, there's obviously a very [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=890.9s)]
*  important decision facing Turkish policymakers, which is what to do now, whether to push ahead [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=896.0999999999999s)]
*  with the military advantage, which is the rhetoric of the government, including Sirte and Jufra, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=903.2199999999999s)]
*  or whether to stop and give a chance to a political ceasefire and political negotiations. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=909.38s)]
*  Great. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=919.3s)]
*  Thank you, Sinan. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=921.6999999999999s)]
*  Jalal. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=923.06s)]
*  Thank you, Fred. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=924.06s)]
*  Thank you, Carnegie Endowment. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=926.0999999999999s)]
*  I'm deeply honored to be able to discuss Libya in this very exciting webinar. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=927.0999999999999s)]
*  The UAE and France, the two meddlers I wanted to describe today, form a dynamic and tight [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=931.2199999999999s)]
*  duo whose effect on Libya has been major and at the same time, unsuccessful. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=938.42s)]
*  Despite the Turkish setback this year, the two countries haven't changed their way of [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=944.62s)]
*  thinking at all. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=948.66s)]
*  That's why it's important to identify their reasoning and fundamental motivations. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=950.6999999999999s)]
*  Let's start with the UAE. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=956.02s)]
*  The UAE was dramatically disappointed in January 2011 when Washington let Husni Mubarak get [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=957.02s)]
*  toppled. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=964.54s)]
*  It saw and continues to see a lack of leadership on the part of the United States when it comes [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=965.54s)]
*  to the Middle East and Africa. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=970.02s)]
*  As a result, the UAE itself now feels responsible for the regional order that should prevail [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=971.8199999999999s)]
*  in the entire Arab-Sunni region. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=977.74s)]
*  It's of course a project that will take another couple of decades, but if you aspire to be [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=980.58s)]
*  a regional overseer, certain political ideas, certain modes of governance can't be tolerated. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=985.0200000000001s)]
*  You can't just accept any form of politics. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=991.6600000000001s)]
*  So which political dynamics are considered a threat by the UAE? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=994.5s)]
*  I would say all bottom-up phenomena writ large, whether they involve rather genuine, sincere [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1000.26s)]
*  forms of liberal democracy or perfectly manipulative form of demagoguery or even populistic [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1005.38s)]
*  authoritarianism like we see in Turkey, for example, with Erdogan. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1011.5400000000001s)]
*  Ideally, in each Arab-Sunni capital, Abu Dhabi would love to have a vertical form of tyranny [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1015.4200000000001s)]
*  where the only political initiatives allowed to exist happen to be in the form of top-down [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1021.58s)]
*  dynamic like in Egypt. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1027.66s)]
*  In that sense, the UAE is not really pragmatic. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1029.66s)]
*  It's absolutist. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1032.8600000000001s)]
*  Basically, in a country as important, as meaningful and rich as Libya, it wants to not contain [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1035.82s)]
*  but eradicate a set of opinions. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1042.3799999999999s)]
*  And that makes basically a very warlike actor. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1044.3799999999999s)]
*  And it allows you to understand the hundreds and hundreds of cargo planes filled with weapons [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1048.54s)]
*  that were in Libya this year and also the symbiosis with Wagner, for instance. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1053.1799999999998s)]
*  Let's get to France. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1059.1799999999998s)]
*  France has been quietly and enthusiastically backing the UAE there. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1060.3s)]
*  Paris supports the UAE regardless of what it does. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1065.74s)]
*  And I think the link between the UAE and France should be analyzed by political scientists. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1069.4199999999998s)]
*  If the UAE were to drop Haftar, France would drop Haftar in the next minute. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1074.54s)]
*  Since 2007, France has sought to play a bigger role in Africa. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1078.78s)]
*  It feels that the United States has become unreliable in that time zone. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1085.18s)]
*  So the same disappointment exists vis-à-vis other European nations. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1090.06s)]
*  For example, the French deeply resent the fact that the Germans refuse to engage in combat [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1095.1799999999998s)]
*  when it comes to the Sahel. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1100.1399999999999s)]
*  So in that kind of environment, the UAE, which has been a very special friend to Paris since [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1101.82s)]
*  the late 70s anyway, appears as the ideal Muslim ally. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1107.1s)]
*  It's Arab, it's Sunni, it sees political Islam as some gangrene, which is an opinion shared [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1111.82s)]
*  by many reporters in Paris these days, ignores idealistic considerations such as human rights [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1117.98s)]
*  and liberal democratic idealism. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1123.74s)]
*  The UAE is deeply interested in the northern part of Africa, which is a nice coincidence. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1125.9s)]
*  Of course, Abu Dhabi spends billions and billions of dollars buying French hardware, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1131.42s)]
*  and it helps Egypt do the same. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1135.8200000000002s)]
*  Abu Dhabi itself possesses a military discipline much greater than Saudi Arabia, for instance. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1138.14s)]
*  And its wealth also means that it spends a lot of money in the theaters that it interferes [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1143.5s)]
*  in. It's willing to violate international law as long as it has a prestigious Western friend that [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1147.74s)]
*  takes care of diplomatic immunity and diplomatic coverage. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1153.66s)]
*  And from that point of view, France feels that it's attaching itself to a winner of the next [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1158.54s)]
*  two or three decades, and that's the time horizon that we should keep in mind. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1163.9s)]
*  So my conclusion is that this duo, and in fact, I would expand it to a trio because there's a [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1169.26s)]
*  political will to get closer and closer to Russia, work with it very tightly, then that trio has to [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1174.14s)]
*  be taken seriously. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1179.5800000000002s)]
*  In that, because if the US does actually exit that time zone, it will be the only game in town [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1181.5800000000002s)]
*  beside Turkey. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1187.3400000000001s)]
*  Regarding Egypt, a few words on Egypt. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1188.7s)]
*  Egypt has been since 2013, often presented as a regional source of stability, not just stability [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1191.3400000000001s)]
*  inside the borders of Egypt, but beyond. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1198.0600000000002s)]
*  And the point I would like to make today is that effectively the territory in which Egypt is willing [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1200.54s)]
*  to actually play an official military role is a very tiny territory. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1207.1s)]
*  Of course, it's in the east of Libya, and it's just a sliver of land along the border of Egypt. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1212.3s)]
*  Egypt doesn't want to go to war in Western Libya, obviously. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1218.78s)]
*  We've seen this this year. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1221.74s)]
*  And even the western half of Syriana, it's conceivable that it will allow others to take care [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1223.4199999999998s)]
*  of it, and if it doesn't work, it doesn't work. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1231.26s)]
*  Politically, and that would be my last remark, Egypt plays a political role in Syriana and has [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1233.8999999999999s)]
*  huge sway. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1239.98s)]
*  It was the one that picked Haftar in 2014, and Egypt tends to have a huge influence politically, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1241.5s)]
*  especially in moments of difficulty. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1247.5s)]
*  And this year, it wants Haftar to hold as little political power as possible, and it's working [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1249.42s)]
*  closely with Russia in terms of installing as many figures loyal to Muammar Gaddafi as possible, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1255.3400000000001s)]
*  and that would be the new leadership in eastern Libya. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1262.38s)]
*  Terrific. Great. Thank you for covering three countries in very succinct fashion. Khadija. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1267.5800000000002s)]
*  Okay. Thank you, Fred. I'll try to be succinct as Shalel. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1273.02s)]
*  Basically, what I'll talk about is about the last year, year and a half of the Libyan media [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1285.1s)]
*  slash social media environment, where we've seen quite a lot of statements from Twitter and [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1292.06s)]
*  Facebook, a lot of pages taken down due to foreign interference. And even if you're an [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1299.66s)]
*  individual user on Twitter, you could probably see this in the last year. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1307.98s)]
*  So I'll start off with December 2018, which is at that point, Libya was thought to have elections [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1313.1000000000001s)]
*  by the end of 2019, and everybody was kind of like getting their campaign in order, and we see [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1322.3000000000002s)]
*  SAFE also come back into play, and a lot of people kind of promoting SAFE, a lot of media, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1329.66s)]
*  and some local movements. One of them was Mandela movement, that also started promoting him. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1337.5s)]
*  And then we have the conflict in 2019, April, where the first visible interference we saw [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1345.02s)]
*  was the Twitter golf kind of collusion of the online space, where you couldn't see anything [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1355.26s)]
*  from actual Libyans on Twitter. It was mostly run by Emirate accounts, Saudi accounts, Egyptian accounts. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1362.54s)]
*  And if you Googled or searched for any Libyan terms, that's all you would find. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1369.34s)]
*  And they're basically promoting Haftar and the LNA quite aggressively. And then that kind of [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1373.82s)]
*  went from social media onto actual media, something called hashtag laundering, where they would be like [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1381.02s)]
*  there is so much social attention from social media, and then report it on Arabia, report it on Sky [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1388.62s)]
*  News, the Arabian version, report it on their channels. And it would look like Haftar has [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1396.1399999999999s)]
*  regional support in the Arab region, Haftar has a lot of support, whereas the GNA is kind of like [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1404.3799999999999s)]
*  the ugly duckling, which nobody supports. And that continued quite a while, where you'd have a lot of [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1410.7s)]
*  mottos and narratives and trying to get the Amr Mokhtar image close to the Haftar image, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1421.9s)]
*  by saying that Amr Mokhtar fought the invaders and Haftar is also fighting the invaders as well. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1427.98s)]
*  And that narrative grew quite a lot until we get to about, let's say September 2019, where we find out [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1434.46s)]
*  the limits of the Russian interference in Libya from Facebook and from the dossier center and [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1442.46s)]
*  Daily Beast kind of articles that come out, where we find out that the two Russian operatives in, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1450.9399999999998s)]
*  we're caught in Tripoli, were actually working on kind of promoting safe and polling quite a lot [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1459.26s)]
*  in the Libya scene. And they worked on manipulating the would-be elections. Facebook took down [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1467.1799999999998s)]
*  a few Facebook pages that were promoting both Haftar and safe at the same time. They were [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1475.82s)]
*  run back through Egypt with connections to the pre-Gosian group. And that was kind of like the [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1480.2199999999998s)]
*  first time we see the extent of the Russian interference. I wouldn't say they were effective, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1488.14s)]
*  but they were clearly like a new element of the Libya battle space. And then we would find out, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1493.26s)]
*  I guess, in 2020 through other leaked documents that were found that Russia also [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1502.6200000000001s)]
*  financially invested in the Libyan media scene through the Al Jameiria channel and through [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1509.26s)]
*  equipping and updating their studios, training their team, and getting a new kind of staff in. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1515.34s)]
*  And for a while, if you look back, you see like the Jameiria channel was fully supporting the [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1523.58s)]
*  LNA and their campaign on Tripoli. And it's kind of like just a whole other type of interference [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1529.4199999999998s)]
*  and weaponizing the information space to basically push forward military goals and agendas. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1537.26s)]
*  And so that was two actors. You have the Gulf kind of like being very direct [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1547.5s)]
*  and not sneaky about it. And then you have Russia kind of choosing the holistic approach [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1552.7s)]
*  by using third-party actors both in Libya and in Egypt to kind of build a sort of organic [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1557.26s)]
*  movement, whether that was for safe or build capacity for the actual local media to do its [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1566.6200000000001s)]
*  bidding for it. And I think those two tools kind of developed and every single important Libyan [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1573.8200000000002s)]
*  incident, whether that be they tried to kind of sabotage the Libyan conference before the conflict, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1581.3400000000001s)]
*  if they tried to sabotage the Berlin conference and anything that comes from that, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1587.8200000000002s)]
*  they tried to sabotage many different Libyan kind of big political events. And the question [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1593.1s)]
*  that everybody always asks, is this effective? I don't think it needs to be effective. I think [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1600.78s)]
*  it needs to kind of like confuse the public opinion enough for nobody to know what's going on, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1605.7399999999998s)]
*  mislead and provoke kind of different actors in the Libya scene. And it goes beyond, is this true [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1611.7399999999998s)]
*  or not? It becomes who's the loudest in the room and who can get their points across. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1620.78s)]
*  Let me see what else. Yeah, so basically in Libya, as we found and other researchers have found, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1627.8999999999999s)]
*  it's not about sure we have the fake videos from the front line, like the Wotia hit, nobody was [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1635.74s)]
*  sure. Everybody was saying, oh, it was this country that hit it. It was that country that hit it. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1642.54s)]
*  But I think that's the point that these foreign actors want us to get to, in that nobody knows [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1647.5s)]
*  anything. So you can basically push whatever you want. And we saw that happen with the airstrike on [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1654.78s)]
*  the military cadets, where it got to a point where people were saying, this is a deep fake. No, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1659.8999999999999s)]
*  it's not true. This did not happen. This airstrike did not happen. Just to kind of round about why [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1665.42s)]
*  this is important for Libya politics. I think the major thing I've seen is Libyan actors and Libyan [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1671.98s)]
*  militia members and even Libyan tribes have woken up to the fact that, okay, we have a direct link [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1679.66s)]
*  to anybody that is on the Libya scene through whether that be Facebook, whether that be just [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1686.7s)]
*  Twitter or YouTube. You upload a video, say your statement, and then you have a direct link to [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1694.14s)]
*  everybody else who wants to work with you, whether that be Russia or the Gulf. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1700.94s)]
*  That was terrific. Fascinating close to our discussion, a really undercover dimension of [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1708.46s)]
*  all this. We've got a lot of questions in the queue, so I'm going to jump to the audience. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1714.3s)]
*  You can submit your questions, as I mentioned, through YouTube chat or through the email address. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1721.26s)]
*  Let's start with a question for Jalal, actually, on this French-Emeradi duo that you mentioned. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1726.86s)]
*  This question says that Libyans are actually more concerned about the French-Emeradi [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1735.34s)]
*  axis than Russian influence. What action is NATO taking against that French-Emeradi [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1742.86s)]
*  axis? Well, NATO is not really a military object anymore, and to bear that in mind helps you [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1750.54s)]
*  understand the frustration of the French. A lot of the frustration that you see emanating from [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1756.3799999999999s)]
*  Paris is really meant for the U.S. and NATO in general, because French, you should never forget, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1762.3799999999999s)]
*  has been struggling in the Sahel. It's cost roughly a billion dollars to get to the Sahel. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1768.9399999999998s)]
*  It's been going on since January 2013, and so this frustration of the French allows you to [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1775.5s)]
*  understand that NATO has become basically just a political topic. In terms of action, nobody [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1780.54s)]
*  seriously expects any kind of action that would be taken in harmony between, you know, that would [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1787.1000000000001s)]
*  include both Turkey and France, obviously, on a theater like Libya. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1793.9s)]
*  Great. There's a question on Russia, moving to Russia for Dimitri. What is Russia's bottom line [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1797.42s)]
*  in its negotiations with Turkey over Libya, and then to what extent can Libya be part of a [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1806.78s)]
*  grand bargain between Ankara and Moscow over Syria? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1813.66s)]
*  Well, I think that's a very good question. I think that's a very good question. I think [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1818.46s)]
*  Ankara and Moscow over Syria. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1825.02s)]
*  Well, as we were speaking, Fred, I got a flash on my iPhone that Foreign Minister Lavrov has [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1828.54s)]
*  just announced that Russia and Turkey were working hard to bring about a ceasefire in Libya. I think [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1836.38s)]
*  like in Syria, Russia and Turkey, or Russia, I will not talk for Turkey, but Russia will seek [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1844.22s)]
*  to split the difference with the Turks, who are the main actor on the other side, if you like, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1852.06s)]
*  mostly on the basis of reciprocal interests, a balance of interest, and that kind of thing. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1860.22s)]
*  Russia has learned to deal with Turkey that it regards as a very important country just [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1866.86s)]
*  south of Moscow, a country with an increasingly independent foreign policy, with increasingly [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1873.4199999999998s)]
*  big regional ambitions. So you have to learn to deal with that. It would be very bad for Russia [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1882.1399999999999s)]
*  if Turkey were to become hostile to Russia, but certainly yielding to Turkey every step of the way [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1889.8999999999999s)]
*  is not something that Russia would engage in. So I think Syria, as you mentioned, is a good example. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1896.78s)]
*  Russia seeks to strike deals with Turkey that would take care of what the Russians would regard [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1905.26s)]
*  as legitimate interests of Turkey, and yet preserve some things that Russia holds important [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1918.06s)]
*  for its policy in Syria, or in this case, in Libya. At the failed Moscow talks a few months ago, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1925.9s)]
*  Russia and Turkey tried to reach a deal on Libya with the Libyans in the room and the Russians and [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1935.34s)]
*  the Turks managing the negotiating process. That failed then, but I think that the idea is to [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1943.26s)]
*  continue doing that, and we'll see what happens. Great, thank you. Sinan, we've got a question to [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1949.98s)]
*  you that we actually, I think, already know the answer to, so I'm going to tag on another question. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1960.94s)]
*  Are allegations that Turkey is subcontracting its military efforts in Libya to Syrian mercenaries [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1968.3s)]
*  correct? And I'll just add another question, but what is Ankara's long-term thinking about these [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1974.78s)]
*  mercenaries in Libya? We hear a lot of talk about their composition, the impact that the [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1982.3s)]
*  deployment in Libya is having on the Syrian opposition in Syria. What's Ankara's long-term [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1991.02s)]
*  plans for these Syrians? Yes, let me start with the second part of your question. I don't think [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=1996.86s)]
*  that there is a long-term thinking about those proxy elements. So far what we've witnessed is [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2005.26s)]
*  really some opportunistic approach to how Turkey manages proxy wars. That's something of a novelty [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2012.7s)]
*  actually for Turkey to rely on these proxy elements. There has been a learning curve of this in Syria [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2021.66s)]
*  since 2012, and now Turkey is exporting some of that know-how to Libya. But that doesn't mean [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2031.5800000000002s)]
*  that there is really any long-term thinking about this. I haven't come across really also any sort [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2042.38s)]
*  of conceptualization or, you know, doctrine about how this should happen within the Turkish [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2048.3s)]
*  doctrinal order of battle. And therefore the answer is it's going to continue to be, you know, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2056.2999999999997s)]
*  this opportunistic use of these proxy elements. It is true that Turkey has relied on these proxy [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2064.2999999999997s)]
*  elements. However, it's debatable whether it was those elements that actually changed the nature [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2072.7799999999997s)]
*  of the dynamics on the ground. I tend to think that it's more Turkey's strategic assets that were [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2080.06s)]
*  deployed there. And, you know, the military know-how through Turkish military advisers [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2085.34s)]
*  to recombine the Saraj forces and essentially mainstream them towards the combat areas. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2092.94s)]
*  Only, you know, a certain perhaps less consequential part of that strategy is due to [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2102.38s)]
*  those proxy forces. That's how I would contend at least. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2109.82s)]
*  Very good. Thank you. Khadija, we've got a question for you on Libya, specifically the [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2116.86s)]
*  political ideological dimension that has assumed a great importance for golf meddling. How would [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2125.42s)]
*  you characterize the Muslim Brotherhood in the ongoing international struggle for Libya? So [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2132.6200000000003s)]
*  I guess their presence in Libya and then also, you know, as a factor in the international arena [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2138.94s)]
*  and perhaps also their linkages to Turkey. I'll just answer with what I see on how they're being [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2145.66s)]
*  utilized on the kind of media scene and the regional media scene. And that I think the Muslim [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2154.46s)]
*  Brotherhood is a friendly bogeyman that everybody knows in the region. And it's easy to kind of [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2160.06s)]
*  frame your arguments within, OK, J&A is connected to the Muslim Brotherhood, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2167.26s)]
*  Muslim Brotherhood is bad. Look what they did in XYZ countries. So it's kind of like a really easy [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2172.0600000000004s)]
*  target to put on the golf media. It's an easy target to push into international media. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2179.0200000000004s)]
*  So I'm not surprised. Like a lot of the videos and like programs that they do which attack the J&A [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2192.6200000000003s)]
*  are always focused on their links with different Muslim Brotherhood members. And then they go and [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2201.5s)]
*  create bios of these members, look at their links with terrorism, blah, blah. So it's a good, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2207.9s)]
*  it's kind of like a good narrative to push everybody's on board. Even somebody who's not [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2213.5800000000004s)]
*  familiar with Libya is familiar with the regional brawl. It's kind of like it goes, it buys into [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2218.38s)]
*  their own biases with regards to the Muslim Brotherhood. So that's why I think it's kind [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2224.86s)]
*  of been a really successful one to push that Western Libya is overrun with Muslim Brotherhood [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2229.6600000000003s)]
*  interference. And it goes into like the Erdogan evil Muslim Brotherhood kind of origin where they [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2235.26s)]
*  have these really dramatic cartoons where they put the picture of Erdogan next to the picture of [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2242.38s)]
*  like Siraj and they're like yes the Muslim Brotherhood's evil hands kind of stretching [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2252.06s)]
*  to Libya as well. So yeah I think that's why it's kind of been pushed and the whole Turkey element [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2258.78s)]
*  just makes it even more for people to these audiences. Great thank you. Jalal back over to [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2265.5s)]
*  you. A question on French-German relations over Libya. You referred to French frustration with [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2273.42s)]
*  the lack of military support by Germany and the Sahel impacting our cooperation in the MENA region. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2281.98s)]
*  How was the German initiative for a political negotiated settlement in Libya received in France [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2288.62s)]
*  against this backdrop and is there a chance that this framework can facilitate any progress [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2294.14s)]
*  on the ground? Well the initial idea from the Germans back in early September 2019 [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2299.8199999999997s)]
*  had all the ingredients to really alarm the French because the main goal was to not just address the [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2308.54s)]
*  Turkish flow of weapons but also the Emirati which is a no-go from a from Paris perspective. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2315.66s)]
*  So but but in the end Germany turned out to be quite malleable and the French made it their [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2323.42s)]
*  mission to actually shape and transform that agenda make it more mellow softer and less dangerous [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2330.7000000000003s)]
*  from an arms embargo violation perspective and in the end Germany turned out to be [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2339.98s)]
*  quite also concerned in terms of maintaining its warm cordial friendship with with the Emirati. So [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2345.6600000000003s)]
*  this idea that Germany is fundamentally different from France when it comes to Libya to me is a myth. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2353.7400000000002s)]
*  The the Sahel disagreement is very very profound, very philosophical, very ideological. Germany [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2360.2200000000003s)]
*  would love to be able to alter the way of thinking of France in the Sahel but at the same time doesn't [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2366.3s)]
*  want to do the the single thing that France would like it to to do which is to get your [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2372.94s)]
*  hands dirty and go to war. So I don't think you know I don't think this [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2378.06s)]
*  you know difference between Germany and France is going to help [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2384.86s)]
*  France change in the end over time. I think a country like Germany would be more and more accepting [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2388.78s)]
*  of this new vision that France has been peddling and I really don't think that it's a fad that is [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2395.02s)]
*  going to pass. I think you know Macron is very serious in terms of rapprochement towards Russia [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2402.14s)]
*  which means in Libya that you effectively accept everything almost that Russia does and that's the [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2407.98s)]
*  reason I've talked about the trio earlier. Good and actually there's another question that's best [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2413.8199999999997s)]
*  directed to you from Nabi Habulos. There are reports on Israel's involvement in Libya presumably [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2420.7s)]
*  helping the UAE in combat operations in support of Haftar. Have you encountered [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2428.54s)]
*  any evidence of this Israeli involvement in terms of weapons etc.? Well regarding this topic every [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2434.3s)]
*  time there's an article that says there's a sympathy from Israel towards Haftar that's [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2442.22s)]
*  considered as a big discovery. I would like to say that Israel funded the Haftar program in Chad in [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2447.42s)]
*  the 80s so this is really nothing new. I really don't think that it's big. I think it exists. I [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2453.58s)]
*  think you have the training program for some elite forces. I think there's also this profound [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2460.22s)]
*  agreement between the UAE and Israel when it comes to the security of the overall area but I think [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2467.98s)]
*  it should be studied. I don't think it can possibly be big. Just meaningful it's interesting but that's [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2474.62s)]
*  it. Okay so Sanan and actually perhaps Jalal as well. The question how serious is the risk of a [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2480.78s)]
*  naval clash between Turkey and France in your view? So this notion of what's happening in the [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2491.6600000000003s)]
*  in the Mediterranean. Sanan? I think Paris will need to decide whether they want a naval clash or [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2498.0600000000004s)]
*  not. If they want to escalate with Turkey then there may indeed be a risk for a naval clash [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2506.78s)]
*  but what we are seeing after the incident two weeks ago [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2516.6200000000003s)]
*  is that the reaction in Paris has been a political one firstly by calling the EU member states [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2525.34s)]
*  for a special meeting that will take place a week from now to deliberate about Turkey. So [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2535.3399999999997s)]
*  France wants to get the support of the EU member states to impose new sanctions. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2544.14s)]
*  I don't think that they will get any such support within the EU also because many of the EU countries [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2551.74s)]
*  are critical of the French position in Libya. So ultimately I think France will refrain from [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2559.98s)]
*  generating a naval incident in the eastern med and close to the Libyan shores with Turkey. I [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2569.1s)]
*  think their reaction has so far been on the political sphere and of course you know they [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2578.06s)]
*  might we still don't know who is really responsible for the attack against the [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2585.26s)]
*  air base but it seems that it may be a French plane used by the UAE that took off from Egypt. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2593.6600000000003s)]
*  So that in itself shows that there's also a French element in the reaction to the Turkish strategy in [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2601.5s)]
*  Libya. I would like to agree with this over the short term but my job here I think is to highlight [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2609.02s)]
*  how stubborn France is and if it could possibly get an incident like this time like last time [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2618.06s)]
*  but a little bit bigger a little bit more dramatic it would be absolutely perfect for political [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2626.14s)]
*  purposes and I don't think we should rule it out. I think we'll have something because Turkey has to [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2630.14s)]
*  do a lot using bullying using force in the Mediterranean and France is deeply committed to [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2636.62s)]
*  helping Greece in that regard so there's going to be plenty of opportunity to have a redox [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2643.8199999999997s)]
*  of that and if it could be just a little bit bigger that would be absolutely ideal from the [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2650.7799999999997s)]
*  French perspective. I think it might happen in terms of incident, violent incidents. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2654.38s)]
*  Great Khadija we've got a question for you. How do Libyans both military and civilians view the [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2660.22s)]
*  Syrian mercenaries on both sides of the conflict so those with the GNA and then also with the [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2667.66s)]
*  Heftar forces? Well it's been used as it's been weaponized by both sides most recently if you've [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2672.3799999999997s)]
*  seen the LNA ad that went viral on Twitter that basically chose how the LNA views [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2679.74s)]
*  Syrian mercenaries in Tripoli where they had like Libyans stopping at a checkpoint, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2687.2599999999998s)]
*  Syrians stop them and then they start to harass the woman in the car and this was seen as so [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2695.2599999999998s)]
*  insulting but that's the kind of view that each side has where the LNA makes jokes about how [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2701.1s)]
*  Tripoli is overrun by Syrians and how they're taking over Libyan people's homes [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2709.18s)]
*  and they basically do what they want. At the same time the GNA has also accused the Heftar side of [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2715.1s)]
*  recruiting Syrians but they're not as obvious as the use on the GNA side so I think Libyans view them [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2722.7s)]
*  as it's kind of like an insult and it's been weaponized and I would say creating harmful [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2730.54s)]
*  stereotypes about Syrians overall in Libya and there's a lot of hate towards it so yeah [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2737.02s)]
*  does that make Syrians in Libya if there are any civilians left a target for sure but I think [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2744.06s)]
*  it it'll just continue to be like a harmful stereotype that grows over time with this conflict [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2751.5s)]
*  and it's used as an insult by both sides. So while I've got you a question [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2757.58s)]
*  I guess you your own analysis but then also the perception of Libyans on the future of Libya as [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2766.7799999999997s)]
*  a federal state and you know we hear a lot of talk about you know partition that's long been [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2773.9s)]
*  a proposed sometimes as a solution so you know I guess what are Libyans thinking about this [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2782.46s)]
*  you know notion of a federalism and this notion of partition? From what I see like I don't think [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2788.06s)]
*  it's such a huge thing with Libyan audience I do think it's planted a lot for actors to seem bigger [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2794.78s)]
*  than it actually is. I saw immediately a week ago something about partition and it was blown [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2802.38s)]
*  out of proportion as in that's not what I see on the Libya scene and I don't see Libyans wanting [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2808.06s)]
*  partition and I don't see Libyans kind of wanting federalism but there are huge grievances and there [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2813.82s)]
*  are like micro aggressions that have been growing with regards to distribution of wealth of the oil [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2819.7400000000002s)]
*  where everybody's saying I want my piece of the pie and I think that's not been addressed for the [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2826.7000000000003s)]
*  past nine years. I think the partition discussion kind of brings about okay we need some sort of [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2832.06s)]
*  governance where everybody gets their resources and I think we see that more clearly with the [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2840.7s)]
*  south right now which has the COVID outbreak that are basically crying to both governments [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2845.58s)]
*  the east and the west saying we need resources but nobody's really listening. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2851.58s)]
*  Yeah and my own opinion would be the same like I don't see partition of federalism as being that [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2856.22s)]
*  thing as certain media sites make it out to be but I do think there is a possibility for [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2862.7s)]
*  these sort of grievances to grow out of proportion within like the next 10 years and maybe then we'll [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2870.14s)]
*  get to a point where okay maybe it's normalized that much that it might be a potentially good idea. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2876.4599999999996s)]
*  Yeah excellent that's a good point. We've got a question for [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2882.54s)]
*  Dimitri. The deployment of Russian combat aircraft to Libya was this a significant turning point or [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2890.94s)]
*  just another chip that Russia was playing a continuation? How do you assess that you know [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2900.94s)]
*  deployment which obviously got a lot of attention not least from AFRICOM. How does that fit into [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2907.42s)]
*  Russia's broader strategy? Well I think it was a turning point but a minor one. I think it's [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2913.1800000000003s)]
*  certainly a case of Russia raising its stakes militarily in the conflict. Russia is not [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2919.58s)]
*  formally engaged in combat in Libya and I do not think that Russia will be engaging in a conflict [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2929.98s)]
*  formally in Libya but certainly this deployment of aircraft which still has a lot of questions [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2938.2999999999997s)]
*  unanswered is an important element. I think that basically it's the way I see it. It's more of a [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2948.22s)]
*  Russian response to the Turkish use of drones so that Russia tries to balance the situation on the [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2961.1s)]
*  ground in preparation I imagine of some kind of a deal with Turkey but I do not see that this [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2970.3s)]
*  presages Russia's military intervention Syria style in Libya. I see no chance of that. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2978.78s)]
*  Great and another question to you Dimitri. You noted there's no significant Libyan influence on [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2989.5s)]
*  Russian policy in Libya but what are your I guess reflections on Russia's relationships with the [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=2996.06s)]
*  former regime elements in Libya? Well I think that for the Russians there's not much difference [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3002.7s)]
*  between the former people the new people. Russians take a much more call it cynical view of [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3011.9s)]
*  the entire region and it knows that there are no good guys versus bad guys. You have to deal with [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3020.62s)]
*  people who are part of that culture and Russians have learned to deal with those people. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3032.94s)]
*  So I think that there's no special attachment that the Russians feel for the people from the [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3040.54s)]
*  Gaddafi era. Gaddafi was someone who was considered to be a quasi-ally because he was [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3047.42s)]
*  or rather to the extent that he was anti-US during the Cold War but he was always seen for what he [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3055.82s)]
*  was a very maverick kind of a dictator and you only could get so far with with Gaddafi [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3062.46s)]
*  with Gaddafi. So I think it depends on on people on individual people we're talking about. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3076.14s)]
*  I believe that the Russians have some preference for people with experience. So if you [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3084.7s)]
*  if you have to choose between the managers of the old regime and the fiery revolutionaries [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3094.7s)]
*  the Russians would go for the former. That's the basic attitude. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3102.38s)]
*  Great. Jalal we've got a question for you and obviously in regards to France but other European [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3110.78s)]
*  countries. To what extent are European policies toward Libya driven by a desire for arms sales [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3120.78s)]
*  to Middle East buyers? Well you know I always force myself to think of Qatar which buys a lot [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3126.86s)]
*  of weaponry from France and it has no ideological influence in Paris at all. So I think it's [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3136.86s)]
*  always important to recognize the importance of that business. I think it's basically the starting [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3145.02s)]
*  point and it really mattered a lot the multiple billions that were spent in the years 2014, 2016 [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3151.74s)]
*  but we should always qualify the importance of that very you know cold-hearted realistic parameter. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3159.74s)]
*  It's I think the atmosphere here in Paris and I would say even across all of Western Europe [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3167.8999999999996s)]
*  there is a populistic tendency to flirt with anti-liberal ideas and you know there's a big [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3174.7s)]
*  identification from the philosophical perspective between the French decision makers here and those [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3185.5s)]
*  in Abu Dhabi. So I really would go as far as predicting that over the next several years [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3192.22s)]
*  you'll have other France's in Europe in terms of thinking that yeah in a troubled area like the [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3199.58s)]
*  northern part of Africa we should have sissies everywhere and we should have assads everywhere [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3205.74s)]
*  and this is only going to grow over time so it's not all about you know doing good business and [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3210.86s)]
*  collecting the dividends from a very realistic perspective. There's a lot of ideological [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3217.2599999999998s)]
*  enthusiasm here across all of Western Europe. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3221.74s)]
*  Good. Sinan this is a bit of a sort of military technical question. Is it possible [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3227.1s)]
*  is there a possibility for a direct attack using Turkish air force assets for instance F-16s with [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3235.98s)]
*  refueling capability to the Jufra base and I guess we could sort of expand that about [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3242.7799999999997s)]
*  you know Turkey's capacity and willingness to deploy its air force in the Libyan theater. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3249.1s)]
*  Yes. Theoretically yes Turkey can do that because it has air refueling capacity. It would not be an [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3257.58s)]
*  easy operation because of that but Turkey has that capacity. Of course what Turkish authorities would [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3267.5s)]
*  like to get is some you know forward-facing you know temporary or permanent forward-facing opportunities [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3276.14s)]
*  for the Turkish air force that as far as we understand is now being negotiated with [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3285.02s)]
*  the Tripoli government. So in the near future Turkey could get that but obviously Turkey has [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3291.8199999999997s)]
*  to secure that area as well so it's one you know politically Turkey could be granted that [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3298.7s)]
*  sort of permanent basing but it would force Turkey to invest much more [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3305.9s)]
*  in terms of air defense assets in there and we saw that that is still not the case given the hit [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3313.98s)]
*  to the air base 10 days ago but ultimately that's where we're heading it seems. If you know if the [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3323.8199999999997s)]
*  direction of travel of the Libyan conflict in military terms continues as such Turkey is very [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3334.38s)]
*  likely to end up with an air base and enable the Sinistrata as a result of its help to the Saraj [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3341.34s)]
*  government. Great thank you and just just a follow-up question is splitting Libya a viable option [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3350.62s)]
*  for Turkey considering its maritime agreement with the GNA and its broader economic interests in [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3362.46s)]
*  in Libya? That is not what you know that's not Turkey's political objective at least until now [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3370.06s)]
*  there is you know first issue the Turkish authorities have always iterated support for [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3379.7400000000002s)]
*  the territorial integrity of Libya but obviously things could change if we end up in a situation [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3386.3s)]
*  where you know both sides can't agree and war drags on at some point at least some people in [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3393.42s)]
*  Ankara might entertain the idea of a split where you know the the western part would be under [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3402.78s)]
*  Turkish influence versus an eastern part which would be under Russian, Emirati, French influence [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3412.22s)]
*  or Egyptian influence but we're still a long way from that because even that scenario is not you [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3418.54s)]
*  know a recipe for stability so that would be would be naive to think that that is what you know Turkish [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3424.7799999999997s)]
*  authorities want. I think we may move there or not but today the focus is on consolidating the gains [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3432.7799999999997s)]
*  and pushing for a ceasefire and an eventual political settlement that you know allows Turkey [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3442.46s)]
*  to keep the influence and the positioning that it has in western Libya. Great Khadija the [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3449.3399999999997s)]
*  the media environment you described you know got obviously a lot more toxic around [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3459.2599999999998s)]
*  with the advent of elections do you think it's even possible or advisable to have elections [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3465.3399999999997s)]
*  you know given this this media environment that you've described and especially the foreign [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3472.3799999999997s)]
*  foreign influence? I think last time they didn't really I mean we had a toxic environment last [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3477.18s)]
*  time we just didn't understand the effect of foreign players and I think we really need to [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3485.02s)]
*  kind of get to a sort of national understanding first before we enter any political elections [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3490.3799999999997s)]
*  because all of these little localized sort of things where people can well foreign actors can [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3498.94s)]
*  basically utilize this to kind of widen social divides can be used in any sort of political [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3506.7000000000003s)]
*  elections so I think it's not wise I don't think it take that into consideration but I do think [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3512.54s)]
*  we need some sort of national agreement or national values that we need to agree upon before [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3517.98s)]
*  entering any new sort of elections I don't not that it can make a big huge help but it's something [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3525.26s)]
*  that we it's a foundation that we can build upon entering into this sort of chaotic political [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3531.6600000000003s)]
*  elections environment. Good so back to you Jalal do you see any of the parties that you study I mean [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3538.7000000000003s)]
*  namely the United Arab Emirates and France are they changing their foreign policy [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3549.74s)]
*  in reaction to the losses current losses in Libya and projected losses and I'll just throw out [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3556.22s)]
*  another you know question specifically with regard to the United Arab Emirates there's a lot of talk [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3564.22s)]
*  about the post-pandemic economic crunch in the Gulf countries having an effect on their foreign [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3569.4199999999996s)]
*  policy adventurism could you speak to that with regard to Libya? Yeah I mean when I was preparing [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3576.46s)]
*  for this talk I wanted to have a couple more paragraphs specifically to address this stubbornness [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3586.78s)]
*  aspect because I see a lot of commentary every couple of months that indicates that France is [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3591.9s)]
*  going to revise its opinion, distance itself from the UAE, the UAE is going to distance itself from [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3597.34s)]
*  the LNA and you basically keep hearing that every three four months and there is a political [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3602.7s)]
*  science answer to why this change is completely a figment of some commentators imagination [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3609.5s)]
*  is because they are those actors especially not the UAE doesn't think in terms of conventional [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3619.02s)]
*  security it thinks about ideological security so it just thinks more about perception messaging [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3624.62s)]
*  reputation how to demonize the other actor it doesn't really think in terms of military [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3632.7s)]
*  capability demography geography balance of power and this is going to stay this is not going to [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3638.94s)]
*  go away because those are the very origins of the very reason of Emirati's involvement in [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3646.54s)]
*  in Libya and as I said France is married to this engine and it hasn't been working out [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3655.02s)]
*  but because of the reasons I just said it's not perceived as a failure you know there's a tendency [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3663.58s)]
*  to see see we told you that the Turks were horrible we told you that political Islam was horrible look [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3668.2200000000003s)]
*  what's happening so it's more self-reinforcing than anything else and there's no change in the way of [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3673.26s)]
*  thinking in Paris and certainly not in Abu Dhabi regarding the economic shock first of all those [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3679.5s)]
*  things happen always with several months of time lag and I you know I think at the end of the day [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3686.06s)]
*  I think the the experiment the Libyan experiment from Abu Dhabi's perspective is probably a [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3692.86s)]
*  one billion dollars a year roughly that's digestible I you know and again from their [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3699.98s)]
*  perspective Libya is just important too important the location is perfect the potential economically [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3706.22s)]
*  is perfect from a port's perspective it's also ideal the population is small any ideology could [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3711.8199999999997s)]
*  succeed if you let it alone you leave it alone you know the enemy is going to pop up and send [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3717.3399999999997s)]
*  the wrong message to a much wider area so that is absolutely unacceptable good and a follow-up [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3722.9399999999996s)]
*  question for you as well the likelihood that Egypt could actually go into Libya [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3730.54s)]
*  if the GNA pushes into certain you already mentioned this what you call the sliver of [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3735.82s)]
*  territory that it could conceivably go into but if you could expand on that and then also the domestic [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3740.46s)]
*  impact for Sisi politically if he were to do this could he pull it off politically I guess [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3746.46s)]
*  I think the the image problem of that Sisi has been trying to address is more international than [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3753.9s)]
*  internal internally the Egyptians are grappling with much more tangible issues than whatever is [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3760.1400000000003s)]
*  happening in Libya I would like to also mention that the secure the legitimate security threat [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3766.54s)]
*  that Egypt faced in 2014 out of Benghazi was much more serious than some Turkish presence that is [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3773.1000000000004s)]
*  focused on the oil croissant really but to to prevent the partition that we were discussing [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3780.54s)]
*  just a few minutes ago so this idea that you'll have like a you know radical isomist installed by [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3785.82s)]
*  Turkey and Jabob right at the border is not really part of what Turkey wants Turkey actually wants [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3791.5s)]
*  to demonize the UAE and and achieve some kind of a reasonable relationship with Egypt live with what [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3798.6200000000003s)]
*  like what it has already with Russia and Egypt it feels philosophically much more much closer to [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3805.34s)]
*  Russia than the UAE in moments of difficulty like this so all in all I see the worst case [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3811.26s)]
*  maybe not the very worst case but most likely some kind of an official symbolic stepping into [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3819.34s)]
*  the eastern half of Saryanakia the part that Turkey actually doesn't want you know whether it's [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3826.94s)]
*  Adana or Tobruk or even Benghazi and then it would also be an opportunity to kind of push the LNA to [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3831.98s)]
*  go fight in search which it hasn't been doing in large numbers by the way beyond that there's no [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3838.46s)]
*  desire and economically we're talking about the economic limitation here does it's a very very [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3843.58s)]
*  tangible one it's it's not something that Egypt would like to jump into. Great and while we're [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3848.94s)]
*  on the topic of Saryanakia Khadija there's a question for you a very detailed one on the [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3858.62s)]
*  the social fabric and political fabric of that region is there a rift between the Qadhafis [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3866.54s)]
*  and the Barqawis people of eastern Libya is that present in the east and this question states the [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3873.2599999999998s)]
*  fact that there are rich Qadhafis presumably from Tarhuna that are buying property in Benghazi so [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3882.7799999999997s)]
*  any comments on rifts in the east and specifically with the Qadhafis? [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3889.42s)]
*  The short answer would be no I don't think so and I think in the past couple of years there's [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3896.86s)]
*  actually been like they've been trying to attract former Qadhafi supporters and the language of all [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3901.26s)]
*  the major kind of influencers the major east influencers and the media channels media reporters [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3908.14s)]
*  have all been kind of soft towards the Qadhafi supporters kind of like saying okay you can [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3917.26s)]
*  you can get your green flag out and you can support whoever you want we want everybody to be able to [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3924.5400000000004s)]
*  be comfortable in who they support as long as you don't kind of go over your limits I would say no [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3931.7400000000002s)]
*  um there isn't really much of a divide between um easterners and the Qadhafi supporters I think it [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3937.7400000000002s)]
*  does get politicized in that the ones that the Qadhafi supporters have other sort of um goals [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3946.86s)]
*  who have money and who want to kind of get in into the political zone those you will have like sort of [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3956.1400000000003s)]
*  um kind of frustrations and they don't align on the goal align on the goals and we saw that in [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3965.34s)]
*  some of the media in about march 2020 um where a lot of them started to move away from [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3971.18s)]
*  supporting after any lna but on the citizen level on the population level of people moving towards [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3977.98s)]
*  to the east and buying property um I don't think that's an issue at all and and even in the south [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3984.54s)]
*  like the Qadhafi supporters at the moment seem to be quite free and where they go and um and what [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3991.8999999999996s)]
*  they do there's been a kind of loosening of that sort of stereotype on the greens um yeah [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=3999.18s)]
*  very good good uh Dimitri uh back over to you um is part of Russia's interest in Libya related to [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4008.2999999999997s)]
*  leverage over western Europe uh vis-a-vis migrants and also natural gas [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4016.46s)]
*  I think I would be negative on the migrants issue but uh I would be uh I would support the argument [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4022.7000000000003s)]
*  that part of Russia's involvement in Libya is about natural gas it's uh we talked about the [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4030.46s)]
*  eastern Mediterranean as the focus of Russia's policy in the Middle East and this is in no small [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4038.62s)]
*  in no small measure due to the gas deposits in that area absolutely and I let me reiterate [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4047.58s)]
*  that Russia's motives for involvement in Libya are primarily uh pragmatic and opportunist [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4056.46s)]
*  opportunistic it's not so much about strategy it's not so much about uh you know threatening [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4064.94s)]
*  either NATO or Europe from the south it's about some more practical things and gas is one of those [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4072.94s)]
*  things as far as migration is concerned from the Russian perspective uh the best obstacle to [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4080.54s)]
*  uncontrolled migration into Europe was the Qadhafi regime destroyed by uh the domestic upheaval and [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4088.78s)]
*  the NATO involvement [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4096.7s)]
*  Good um now a question I guess for all the panelists um on the issue of the oil blockade [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4101.179999999999s)]
*  any assessment about when that will be lifted if it will be lifted and then also importantly how [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4110.7s)]
*  can there be any political solution without movement on the oil blockade issue [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4116.0599999999995s)]
*  Should I begin? Yeah go ahead Jalal. I think that uh even that process and it should be really uh [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4121.42s)]
*  completely done in a neutral economic way but even that is even after like almost seven billion [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4131.58s)]
*  dollars worth of uh opportunity cost since January it's still going to be seen politically by foreign [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4138.9400000000005s)]
*  states because uh now that Turkey is here to stay in the west um this uh some characteristic of the [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4147.1s)]
*  the financial system in Libya which is the this almost structural guarantee that every dollar [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4155.9800000000005s)]
*  collected in terms of revenue goes automatically to triple and this was painful before April 2018 [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4162.54s)]
*  and now that Turkey is in town it's even more painful and um and Turkey is by the way is not [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4169.42s)]
*  excellent when it comes to managing this kind of risk it's better with military execution and and [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4175.42s)]
*  strategy and tactics but here this is what I would call a diplomatic risk and the enemies of Turkey [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4181.5s)]
*  are definitely absolutely determined to seize this very legitimate negotiation to revive the exports [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4187.9s)]
*  uh and seize it as an opportunity to set a precedent and and have dollars go elsewhere for [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4195.58s)]
*  the first time in decades of history and if that happens and it might uh it will be considered as a [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4202.3s)]
*  as a victory and it will be utilized uh for the purpose of actually strangling Tripoli now that [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4208.7s)]
*  Erdogan has won it so I would really like to highlight the politic the politicization risk [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4215.58s)]
*  of this process that should should be allowed to happen without that kind of interference but [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4222.06s)]
*  unfortunately that's not the case. Very good um and very briefly less than less than one minute [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4228.06s)]
*  if you can manage this because I think you're the best uh qualified to address these but but the role [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4235.740000000001s)]
*  of Tunisia and Algeria in the in the conflict perhaps playing a role in mediation and then [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4241.34s)]
*  separately very briefly Italy's role. Well Tunisia is just too uh too small and and too weak and I [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4248.14s)]
*  would even say the same thing about Algeria. Algeria is is going to speak a lot about Libya [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4256.22s)]
*  because there's a populistic atmosphere right now in Algiers which also is busy with a very very [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4261.02s)]
*  severe economic crunch and if it could just distract the population with with a topic like [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4267.58s)]
*  like Libya which scares people in Algeria then uh then it will be done it doesn't mean that it's [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4275.58s)]
*  going to be taken seriously it doesn't mean that there's going to be a follow-up similar to what [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4281.42s)]
*  Algeria was able to pull off five or six years ago and so you'll see periodically uh some kind [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4285.66s)]
*  of diplomatic initiative by by Algeria it has good potential it is actually perceived as neutral by [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4292.78s)]
*  many Libyans but unless a power like Russia uh you know marries uh its own efforts with all the [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4298.78s)]
*  potential of Algeria. Algeria is just going to you know be vocal from time to time and not accomplish [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4306.0599999999995s)]
*  anything it's just too weak for that. In terms of Italy I think uh Italy is busy going back into [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4311.02s)]
*  bed with the GNA and uh but it's again it's too small compared to the the French dynamic that I [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4316.700000000001s)]
*  was describing so it's not going to change the the European picture that I was giving earlier. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4322.22s)]
*  Good so we're almost out of time but we've got a couple questions related to the um US role and [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4327.820000000001s)]
*  and I want to I can certainly offer my take on that but I do want to address it to the panelists [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4333.740000000001s)]
*  and specifically to Sinan um the your sense of the US position vis-a-vis Turkey and Libya I was [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4338.22s)]
*  on a panel yesterday on with some Europeans and there was a sense about the paradox that [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4346.14s)]
*  there was a tacit US support for Turkey and Libya and yet the US was also backing the uh you know [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4351.740000000001s)]
*  eastern Mediterranean gas deal with Turkey's rivals so your sense of the US position um I guess on [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4357.66s)]
*  Turkey in Libya? Well we're also actually trying to understand uh how much of an appetite there is [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4364.94s)]
*  you know in Washington to get involved in Libya and so far you know there isn't much it seems [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4375.0199999999995s)]
*  and it's understandable you know so close to the elections I don't think that any US government [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4381.66s)]
*  will have an inclination to invest heavily politically militarily in in Libya so that [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4387.58s)]
*  impacts obviously you know how Turkey looks at the US however given that we've had our share of [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4396.0599999999995s)]
*  difficulties over the past few years and I won't name them there's so many really. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4404.3s)]
*  Libya possibly is an area either for the Trump administration or an incoming [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4410.14s)]
*  at the Biden administration is an area where Turkey and the US could actually have convergent [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4415.66s)]
*  objectives one of them due respect to Dimitri would be to limit Russian influence as to NATO [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4422.7s)]
*  allies so that could be indeed an area of collaboration between Turkey and the US [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4429.82s)]
*  and I think it would be fair to say that Washington and Ankara are really in need of some of some [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4437.0199999999995s)]
*  convergence on foreign policy aspects and Libya could be one going forward. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4443.18s)]
*  Excellent I think that's a good note to close on we are all watching the elections in US and of [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4449.34s)]
*  course it may have an effect on Libya but I want to thank our panelists for a very rich [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4456.54s)]
*  discussion very succinct discussion covering multiple countries multiple dimensions of a very [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4462.22s)]
*  conflict complex civil war thank you all and thank you to the audience [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4467.5s)]
*  for some very intriguing and compelling questions as well thank you everyone. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6wsHomH-k&t=4472.62s)]
