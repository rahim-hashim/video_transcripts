Video Description: Lebanon’s political economy has long been described as exceptional. The trope of a “Lebanese economic miracle,” in which Lebanon is a paragon of economic success, was long amplified by the ruling elite in order to maintain a status quo.

The 2019-2020 crises not only swept away this idea but also made blatant another kind of exceptionalism in the country—its record-high income and wealth inequality, which is perpetuated by the corrupt political economy. Extreme inequality is not a new phenomenon, however; rather it was brushed aside by the ruling elite, which largely consists of the nation’s wealthiest.

How can Lebanon create a new economic model that would put social justice at its core? Did the 2019 revolution create the opportunity to think and design policies that could decrease inequality levels? Join us for a conversation with Lydia Assouad, Toufic Gaspard, Haneen Sayed, and Gregg Carlstrom to discuss Lebanon’s worsening inequality and Assouad's latest paper, Lebanon's Political Economy: From Predatory to Self-Devouring, on Friday, February 19 from 5:00-6:00 p.m. Beirut (10:00-11:00 a.m. EST).

# Is Now Finally the Time to Discuss Inequality in Lebanon?
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [February 19, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s)
*  Okay, good evening, everyone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you for joining us on a Friday evening, no less, for this panel discussion about inequality [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=5.28s)]
*  and poverty in Lebanon. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=10.52s)]
*  My name is Greg Karlstrom. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=12.06s)]
*  I'm a Middle East correspondent for The Economist. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=13.24s)]
*  I'll be moderating this talk for the next hour. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=15.88s)]
*  Before I get to my introductory remarks, let me just first introduce our three panelists. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=19.0s)]
*  We have three excellent speakers joining us this evening. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=24.68s)]
*  I'll speak for a couple of minutes and then I will get out of the way and let them do [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=27.96s)]
*  the talking. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=32.4s)]
*  So joining us first, we have Lydia Aswad, who is an economist at the Paris School of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=33.4s)]
*  Economics and the World Inequality Lab and the former Riyan Fellow at the Malcolm H. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=37.68s)]
*  Kerr Carnegie Middle East Center. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=43.72s)]
*  Second, we have Taufit Gaspard, who is a former senior advisor to the Lebanese Ministry of [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=45.84s)]
*  Finance and an advisor to the International Monetary Fund. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=50.6s)]
*  And finally, Hanin Sayed, who is the lead human development specialist at the World [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=54.96s)]
*  Bank. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=59.32s)]
*  Of course, thank you to all three of you for being here as well. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=60.32s)]
*  The topic again tonight, inequality and poverty in Lebanon. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=64.2s)]
*  I think by way of introductory remarks, I'll just talk quickly about the title of the panel, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=67.92s)]
*  which is now finally the time to discuss inequality in Lebanon. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=73.92s)]
*  The word now sort of doing two things. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=78.6s)]
*  On the one hand, we're talking about the current economic situation in Lebanon, the profound [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=82.16s)]
*  economic and humanitarian crisis that the country finds itself in, a state and a financial [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=88.75999999999999s)]
*  sector that are both essentially insolvent, a currency that has lost more than 80 percent [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=93.8s)]
*  of its value over the past 15 or so months and has become really untethered from any [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=99.16s)]
*  underlying economic reality, which is certainly a discomfiting experience for many people [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=106.08s)]
*  not knowing the value of their money. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=111.66s)]
*  But it's gone beyond that and it's become, of course, for many Lebanese, a profound economic [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=113.97999999999999s)]
*  and humanitarian crisis. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=118.82s)]
*  People who were previously in the middle class who had fairly comfortable lives find themselves [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=121.5s)]
*  suddenly pushed into poverty. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=125.62s)]
*  People who were poor before now finding themselves barely able to survive, wondering how long [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=128.76s)]
*  they'll be able to provide for their families and provide basic necessities. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=136.42s)]
*  And then looming in the background of all of this, the possible reduction or cessation [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=141.29999999999998s)]
*  of subsidies by the central bank, which could send inflation numbers, which are already [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=145.38s)]
*  above 200 percent year on year, 400 percent for food, 500 percent for clothing. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=150.82s)]
*  The sort of looming end of subsidies threatens to push all of those numbers even higher. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=156.5s)]
*  So all of this is the current economic situation in Lebanon. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=160.83999999999997s)]
*  But the topic here, this issue of inequality, of course, did not begin in October of 2019. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=165.62s)]
*  Inequality has been part of the Lebanese economy, Lebanese society for perhaps as long as there [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=172.98000000000002s)]
*  has been a sovereign Lebanon. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=178.02s)]
*  And government policies, economic policies from the Lebanese government have sustained [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=180.38000000000002s)]
*  and exacerbated levels of economic inequality that are some of the highest in the world. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=184.74s)]
*  So we're going to be talking not only about the current situation in Lebanon, but also [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  about the broader context here of how Lebanon arrived at such a level of economic inequality [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=194.38s)]
*  and perhaps some policy recommendations that might help to ameliorate that in the future. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=200.54s)]
*  We are going to start, I think, with Lydia, but I'm not sure if she's still on the call. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=207.5s)]
*  I think she may have logged out and may need to log back in. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=211.5s)]
*  Do we know if she's going to be back soon or should we go to one of our other panelists [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=215.62s)]
*  first? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=220.18s)]
*  OK, I'm not sure. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=224.42000000000002s)]
*  So, Hanin, I'm sorry, it's going to fall to you then to speak a little earlier than you [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=225.70000000000002s)]
*  thought you were going to speak. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=230.94s)]
*  All of this, I mean, Lydia will, of course, go through her research. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=233.74s)]
*  This panel is based on research that she has done and a paper that she has done, which [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=236.38s)]
*  is available on the Carnegie website. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=241.42000000000002s)]
*  She will, when she rejoins us, summarize that research and summarize her paper. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=243.34s)]
*  But, Hanin, if you can talk to some of these issues of poverty, of inequality, of the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=248.02s)]
*  underinvestment in basic social services that has been a systemic problem in Lebanon. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=253.06s)]
*  Of course, you work for the World Bank. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=258.42s)]
*  These are issues that are of the utmost importance to the bank. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=259.74s)]
*  So if you could give us your thoughts on this issue of inequality in Lebanon. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=263.34s)]
*  Thank you, Greg. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=269.9s)]
*  And please just confirm that you can hear me. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=270.9s)]
*  Thumbs up. You can hear me well. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=274.34000000000003s)]
*  OK, great. Thank you. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=276.3s)]
*  And I certainly will not take Lydia's place and I hope that she gets back quickly. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=278.1s)]
*  Her paper is extremely interesting and in a way can be a breakthrough in providing [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=283.70000000000005s)]
*  another look of how to identify, calculate or measure inequality in Lebanon. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=291.06s)]
*  And I say this because the first thing that strikes you about Lebanon is a lack of [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=297.46000000000004s)]
*  adequate data, especially the kind of data that is needed to have a time series on [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=303.14s)]
*  inequality or poverty, which basically we don't. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=309.42s)]
*  So I really like the work that she is doing. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=314.78000000000003s)]
*  And I hope that she obviously she will come back in and have a chance to explain more of it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=317.66s)]
*  And using more tax data, fiscal data, macro data is what is a methodology that she uses. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=324.34000000000003s)]
*  I think the story, however, is consistent with whatever we know first from looking at [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=331.94s)]
*  whatever exists in terms of some poverty information and even some inequality measures, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=337.86s)]
*  as in Gini coefficient that have been attempted in the 1960. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=343.14000000000004s)]
*  And we do see that essentially poverty, even in 1960s, was high and remained high. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=347.22s)]
*  Somehow it was kind of stuck at a level of at 30 percent high upper poverty line, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=354.74s)]
*  10 or 8 percent the extreme poverty line. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=362.53999999999996s)]
*  So this continues to be the case going into the crisis. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=365.65999999999997s)]
*  However, when the crisis is hit and of course, in Lebanon, we all know that there are [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=371.02s)]
*  multiple crises that we are dealing with, the economic financial one, the covid pandemic [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=375.98s)]
*  and then the port of Beirut blast on August 4th. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=382.34s)]
*  Our estimate from the World Bank is that poverty has almost doubled since 2012, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=386.26s)]
*  which is the only series or data that we can say is comparable and we are measuring. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=392.58s)]
*  So we have from 2012 to 2020 using now casting and forecasting techniques. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=398.97999999999996s)]
*  Again, I said in the beginning, I qualified that, you know, new household budget surveys [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=405.94s)]
*  are not available, but using techniques that utilize the previous data shows us that [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=410.62s)]
*  extreme poverty has increased from 10 percent to 22 percent. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=417.7s)]
*  This is what we call food poverty, i.e. anybody who is below that level or that threshold [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=422.46s)]
*  is not able to be provided with the basic food needs, their daily caloric intake. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=429.9s)]
*  And the upper poverty line also has increased dramatically since 2012 from 22 percent or 23 percent now to about 45 percent. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=437.82s)]
*  And you hear a lot of different numbers on poverty in Lebanon anyway now. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=449.34s)]
*  Esquad has also produced some numbers, but just for everybody to know that none of these are based on new surveys. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=452.94s)]
*  Essentially, we are trying to squeeze as much as we can the previous survey using the household budget survey, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=460.02s)]
*  but not getting into any technicalities. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=465.21999999999997s)]
*  I think the point to be made is that, yes, poverty and inequality has been high and it seems that it has doubled since the crisis. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=467.26s)]
*  So these multiple crises that have hit Lebanon since October 2019 are very severe in terms of people's welfare. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=474.42s)]
*  I want to say a few things about digging down, kind of decomposing what this poverty and inequality drivers are. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=484.58s)]
*  And I want to focus in on the human development aspect, which is, yes, it is my area of work, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=494.58s)]
*  but also we all know that investing in good quality human capital is a big driver for productivity and for economic growth. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=500.18s)]
*  So the World Bank, we produced in 2018 a human capital index. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=512.5s)]
*  It is different from UNDP and World Economic Forum human capital development indices. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=518.14s)]
*  This one is different in the sense that it actually measures productivity and therefore economic growth. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=524.14s)]
*  And it basically did this analysis, this index for all countries of the world, almost, for which there is data. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=530.7s)]
*  And it's almost we had more than 100 countries where this index was calculated from zero to one. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=538.1800000000001s)]
*  Lebanon is at 52 or 0.52. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=543.74s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=546.38s)]
*  It means that a child born today in Lebanon, when she reaches full maturity age of 18, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=547.3s)]
*  i.e. has finished your basic set of education levels and has had health interventions as well, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=556.26s)]
*  is only 52 percent as productive as she can be given the current state of health and education. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=564.06s)]
*  So the Human Capital Index of the World Bank focuses on health and education. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=572.14s)]
*  And as I said, with a 52 percent only of what a person born today in Lebanon can reach if nothing changes in the system. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=577.5s)]
*  That's like 48 percent loss of productivity. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=589.8599999999999s)]
*  That's essentially how you can look at it and a really significant loss in economic growth. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=592.74s)]
*  And this index, which we've calculated it, recalculated it for the past two years, has shown a decline. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=598.9399999999999s)]
*  So since 2018 and in 2020, there's actually been a decline for Lebanon in terms of its human capital index. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=606.1s)]
*  All very disconcerting. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=613.1s)]
*  And the main drivers of this decline in the index actually is the education. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=614.78s)]
*  So on health indicators, Lebanon tends to be OK as measured by stunting and other health indicators. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=622.46s)]
*  But for education, one in terms of years of education, it is around 10 years of education compared to what is considered the full frontier. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=631.0999999999999s)]
*  It's 14 years because it's 12 years plus two years early childhood, which is an important investment. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=641.3399999999999s)]
*  So even with the high enrollment rates that we have in Lebanon, you have this 10 years. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=646.42s)]
*  But then if you do a quality adjustment years of learning, this is a technique that the World Bank team has developed using quality [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=651.8199999999999s)]
*  measures as in international exams like Tim's and Pisa. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=660.7s)]
*  The learning adjusted years of education for Lebanon for a child today in Lebanon is six years. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=665.46s)]
*  So it drops from 10 years to six. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=673.58s)]
*  So effectively, that's what they're learning six years by the time they graduate from high school. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=675.5s)]
*  That is definitely not good. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=679.34s)]
*  And then when we decompose it by trying to compose it by socioeconomic status, we do see that [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=681.38s)]
*  essentially for those in the lower income, their situation is even their adjusted years of learning is even maybe half of the six years. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=690.22s)]
*  So huge inequity in terms of access to education, but more important access to quality education. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=701.6600000000001s)]
*  And this is quite interesting because everybody's notion is that Lebanon, its education system is what has kept this country and so on and that. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=708.22s)]
*  But what I want to say here, and this comes into the theme that Lydia is speaking about, this is a huge inequality. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=717.1s)]
*  So, yes, you have top tier schools and universities and people who graduate in those and make it to the best universities and so on in the world. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=721.6999999999999s)]
*  But really, the system itself is hugely inequitable. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=731.14s)]
*  I'll give another example on human capital inequality. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=734.5s)]
*  And here I will stop so that passed to Lydia after this in social protection, which is an area that I've also been working on for some years [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=737.18s)]
*  here in Lebanon. If we look at the social insurance or the pension scheme of Lebanon, you have a totally bifurcated system, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=746.62s)]
*  one which is for the public sector, i.e. the civil servants and the military, and then a non-existing one actually for everybody else. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=755.9s)]
*  Those that are in the private sector, let alone nothing for the informal sector, of course. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=764.38s)]
*  So just to give you one figure, the public pension scheme covers barely 12 percent of the labor force, which is roughly the military and the civil servant. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=768.74s)]
*  But it costs the country every year four percent of GDP. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=781.6999999999999s)]
*  So that is a huge inequity in and of itself, because, as I was saying, the private sector pretty much doesn't have a pension scheme, has a lump sum [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=786.5s)]
*  and the service indemnity when they leave the workforce, they get a lump sum, which is very inadequate. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=795.78s)]
*  And then you and that's only half of the labor force. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=802.22s)]
*  The rest is informal and have almost nothing. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=804.86s)]
*  Again, huge inequities in the way the social protection system has been has been. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=807.3399999999999s)]
*  And this is relevant because when Lydia is going to talk about tax reform and how Lebanon needs to, yes, spend more, but spend differently. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=812.62s)]
*  It needs to address this inequity in expenditure in human capital. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=826.78s)]
*  There's similarly in the health sector. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=832.3399999999999s)]
*  We can also talk about that. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=833.9s)]
*  But let me stop here and turn back to you, Craig. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=835.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=840.4599999999999s)]
*  OK, thank you, Hanin, both for the insightful comments and for being a good support about being put on the spot all of a sudden. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=842.1s)]
*  Lydia is back with us. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=849.8199999999999s)]
*  And so I'm going to to pass it to her now. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=851.14s)]
*  As I said before, this discussion based partly on a paper that you've done, based on research that you've done, a paper that's available on the Carnegie website. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=854.42s)]
*  And so perhaps you can summarize for us what you found in your research, what you've written about, not only relating to the the current economic crisis in Lebanon and its impacts on poverty and inequality, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=864.02s)]
*  but also about the broader scope of its history and the government policies that have exacerbated and sustained inequality in Lebanon. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=877.26s)]
*  Hi, can you hear me now? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=901.4200000000001s)]
*  Can everyone hear me? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=902.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=907.42s)]
*  OK, sorry. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=907.82s)]
*  So, sorry, I don't know what happens with my connection, but thank you very much for the introduction, Greg. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=908.5s)]
*  And it's a great pleasure to be here to discuss with Hanin and Toufik. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=915.86s)]
*  It's a great honor. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=920.98s)]
*  And so unfortunately, I won't be much more positive than that. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=921.98s)]
*  Because talking about poverty and inequality in Lebanon is quite tough, as you will see. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=927.58s)]
*  So I think I'll have some slides if they can be shared and hopefully there won't be any other technical issues. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=933.22s)]
*  So I don't know if. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=944.18s)]
*  The slides are visible now. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=947.58s)]
*  Yes, perfect. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=954.9399999999999s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=958.98s)]
*  So, yes, so I will start with one first observation. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=959.98s)]
*  If we can move to the next slide. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=967.98s)]
*  So the first observation I want to start with is the fact that Lebanon is really truly exceptional in terms of income and wealth inequality and also about poverty, as Hanin said. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=970.94s)]
*  So, I think that's a great point. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=984.26s)]
*  Lebanon is really truly exceptional in terms of income and wealth inequality and also about poverty, as Hanin said. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=987.46s)]
*  So what does this mean? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=995.86s)]
*  So thanks to newly available micro fiscal data, I was able to estimate the entire distribution of the national income in Lebanon. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1000.9399999999999s)]
*  So I was able to track how the total income produced in a year was distributed among the population. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1010.58s)]
*  And what I can find and what I found is quite disturbing. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1018.26s)]
*  So if we look at the first year. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1022.34s)]
*  So if we click on the so now on the previous slide, no, not before. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1027.6200000000001s)]
*  So I should have. So if we click on figure one, yes, perfect. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1033.02s)]
*  So we can see the main results that shows the distribution of the national income. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1036.7s)]
*  So basically, the top 10 percent richest adult in Lebanon receives approximately 55 percent of the total national income, while the bottom 50 percent of the population. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1042.3s)]
*  So so half of the of the population receives approximately 10 percent of the total national income. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1054.3400000000001s)]
*  And then the middle 40 percent, which broadly corresponds to the middle class, is left with approximately 34 percent of the total national income, which is way less than the top 10 percent. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1061.42s)]
*  We just so this places Lebanon among the country with the highest levels of inequality in the in the world. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1075.26s)]
*  So as we can see, we go back. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1083.38s)]
*  And go on figure two, we can compare the top 10 percent income share of Lebanon with the one of other countries in the world. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1087.9s)]
*  So so Brazil or South Africa, which are usually seen as the most unequal countries in the world, are just above Lebanon. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1098.74s)]
*  And Lebanon is most more unequal than Russia or the United States over the 2005 and 2014 period. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1110.1s)]
*  So if we go back. Sorry. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1119.3799999999999s)]
*  So so this is what is important to say that this is absolutely not new, although the data is only available from 2005 to 2014. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1124.1799999999998s)]
*  And basically the so-called Lebanese economic miracle, which was a narrative that was really widespread, according to which Lebanon was sort of a model of economic success in the region, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1136.14s)]
*  a country that could resist most of the political shock and ensure to its citizens a relatively higher average income for its citizen was actually false. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1147.3000000000002s)]
*  And this high average income was driven by a very small group at the top, which largely coincide with the ruling elites. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1161.62s)]
*  And obviously, the crisis since 2019 have all likely would increased. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1169.1s)]
*  Inequality and poverty. So if we go to the next slide. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1179.22s)]
*  So we can talk more about the causes of why we have such an unequal redistribution of resources in the country. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1187.7s)]
*  I explained in the paper that it's basically something systemic that we can track to the institution of the country, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1196.14s)]
*  in particular, the consortium of democracy and the sectarian based mode of governance. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1203.5800000000002s)]
*  And we can talk more about it. But one consequence is that it has allowed the ruling elite to maintain strong link with the business elite and basically to maintain a status quo, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1209.82s)]
*  to pass laws that protect their economic and political privilege. And this has had many consequences. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1222.82s)]
*  One of them was to have a very, very protective fiscal laws for the riches. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1230.34s)]
*  So Lebanon is a country with very low fiscal capacity, which means that it has very low tax revenues compared to other countries in the world. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1242.02s)]
*  15 percent of the total growth domestic products against an average of 34 percent for the OECD countries. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1252.1399999999999s)]
*  And what is important is that the tax system relies mostly on indirect taxes. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1264.9s)]
*  That is, taxes that do not depend on people's income are the same for everyone. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1269.54s)]
*  And so that are very aggressive. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1285.54s)]
*  That is, the poor pay a higher share of the income than the government's WhatsApp. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1295.74s)]
*  And the system is part of the entire system, the very low rates compared to other countries. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1320.22s)]
*  So we don't see it. Can we go to the figure? Thank you. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1327.98s)]
*  So here you can see the evolution of what we are what is called the top marginal tax rates. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1334.42s)]
*  That is the rates that the richest individual are paying on their income. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1339.1s)]
*  And we can see that Lebanon has a relatively lower rate historically compared to France, the United Kingdom or the United States. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1345.2199999999998s)]
*  And actually, the same conclusion can be made if we compare Lebanon to countries from the global south. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1356.4599999999998s)]
*  And finally, if we come back to. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1364.38s)]
*  So now that we have said this, what what can we say? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1369.3000000000002s)]
*  So, yes, we can move to the next slide. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1376.5800000000002s)]
*  So, yes, all this to say that Lebanon has a very large margin of maneuver and can really improve largely about its fiscality. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1381.74s)]
*  And in the paper, I propose several reforms that you can discuss in more detail, but in particular, establish a general income tax that taxes all income sources together and at progressive rates, which is not the case currently. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1393.46s)]
*  Given the urgency and emergency of the situation now, it would be good to implement an exceptional wealth tax on billionaires and millionaires that are doing quite well. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1408.14s)]
*  And for an example, just a 10 percent tax on the billionaires wealth could yield three percent of the total national income. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1422.3799999999999s)]
*  And if we click on the figure, we can see that actually billionaires in Lebanon are doing quite well. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1428.62s)]
*  So this is the the share of billionaires wealth compared to the total national income. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1435.3799999999999s)]
*  And in Lebanon, this ratio is quite high of 30 percent of national income. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1442.86s)]
*  So comparable to to the oligarch in Russia and other extremely unequal country. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1448.8999999999999s)]
*  So so there is something to tax here, like a quite a large base. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1454.4599999999998s)]
*  But more generally, if we go back, yes, please. Thanks. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1459.74s)]
*  I think Lebanon can think about implementing a more compressive and progressive wealth tax, given most of the economy is based on the real income tax. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1465.74s)]
*  And really. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1479.02s)]
*  OK, unfortunately, I think we're we're losing Lydia's connection again, but she got through, I think, most of her presentation, which is a lot to take in. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1488.62s)]
*  So Taufi will turn to you for your comments. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1497.86s)]
*  And obviously, you have the floor for a few minutes. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1501.1799999999998s)]
*  Take them in whatever direction you would like. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1503.9799999999998s)]
*  But perhaps also as someone who has advised the Lebanese finance ministry, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1506.8999999999999s)]
*  who has perhaps worked on or thought about some of these issues surrounding inequality or taxation or any of the other issues that Lydia and Haneen highlighted. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1513.26s)]
*  If you could perhaps also give us a bit of a not only a response to the paper, but maybe a bit of an inside view on these issues vis a vis the Lebanese government. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1523.5s)]
*  Thank you, Greg. I hope Lydia is listening because most of my comments are on her paper. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1533.8999999999999s)]
*  Is she? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1542.86s)]
*  She's still connected. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1546.6999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1548.1399999999999s)]
*  OK, I would have to compliment first. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1550.1399999999999s)]
*  I would like to compliment Lydia on her paper. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1554.02s)]
*  I mean, the effort is remarkable. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1557.1s)]
*  It takes a lot of effort to work to publish something on the issue of income in Lebanon. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1559.62s)]
*  And especially, she also brought in a new factor that few talk about. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1566.4599999999998s)]
*  And nobility between classes. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1572.78s)]
*  So having said that, I would like to bring in some critical comments. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1576.2199999999998s)]
*  So I hope Lydia, you take it in the spirit of improving. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1580.58s)]
*  Now, all these results are déjà vu. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1587.5s)]
*  You mentioned it. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1590.54s)]
*  I mean, the distribution of income and wealth in Lebanon has always been very skewed. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1591.4599999999998s)]
*  And the skewness is even more exacerbated in periods of recession. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1598.98s)]
*  I'm not talking about the recent collapse crisis now. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1604.1399999999999s)]
*  So the point is to say, well, what's new? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1608.1799999999998s)]
*  Two things you may have mentioned. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1612.98s)]
*  One, there has been a paper in February 2017 by UNDP team at the mercy of finance. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1614.9s)]
*  Excellent. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1621.38s)]
*  Using micro-fiscal data about half a million taxpayers, about the distribution of private income. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1622.5400000000002s)]
*  So that should have been included in your paper as well. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1630.7800000000002s)]
*  In my book as well, I have several tables that took me a month to establish about the distribution of income [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1634.38s)]
*  and physical and financial wealth from the early 50s until the late 90s. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1640.8999999999999s)]
*  And I calculated Gini coefficients and using the data as they are without using correction factors, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1647.02s)]
*  as some of the world data do. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1655.06s)]
*  So these can be very useful for you. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1658.1399999999999s)]
*  And then you can see since the early 50s. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1661.06s)]
*  In fact, it was not the first was not Irfan. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1663.1s)]
*  There have been a few studies in the early 50s, one by the famous Churchill, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1666.46s)]
*  who wrote an important study on Beirut in the early 50s. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1671.78s)]
*  So these have given us still give us very important insights on the distribution of income and wealth in the early 50s. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1675.3400000000001s)]
*  But the bottom line is that nothing has changed. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1683.0600000000002s)]
*  Nothing has changed. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1687.78s)]
*  So what's new? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1689.38s)]
*  What's new? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1691.22s)]
*  Two, my major comment I have is on your recommendations, Lydia. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1693.1399999999999s)]
*  You talk about political economy, ruling elite, ruling class, the looting of the treasury, these nice expressions. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1698.58s)]
*  And then all your recommendations are about tax reform. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1706.9399999999998s)]
*  I mean, what's I don't see the link. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1709.9399999999998s)]
*  You talk about all these political problems and all the corrections have to do with taxation. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1714.6599999999999s)]
*  I understand that you work the Paris School of Economics with Piketty and Saz [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1721.74s)]
*  because Piketty's and Saz work is essentially on taxation reform in very advanced economies. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1727.18s)]
*  This does not necessarily mean they apply here, especially in most developing countries. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1733.1s)]
*  Like, for instance, you talk about direct taxation, progressive taxation. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1738.54s)]
*  I think this would be totally useless in Lebanon. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1742.58s)]
*  You should know that in practically all developing countries, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1745.34s)]
*  fiscal basis is usually in direct taxation, not because they prefer direct taxation, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1749.82s)]
*  but because administration and fiscal management is usually underdeveloped to the point that they cannot really rely on direct taxation. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1755.54s)]
*  So trying to recommend the model of advanced economy, especially one like France or Britain or Germany or Japan or the US, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1765.42s)]
*  to say, OK, let's do as they do that, then I don't think would be useful at all. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1775.18s)]
*  Some other comments in the paper, for instance, you say the financial collapse was inevitable. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1783.6200000000001s)]
*  Why inevitable? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1790.14s)]
*  We had 15 years of war, 79 to 90. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1792.9s)]
*  And the banking system remained the strongest. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1800.78s)]
*  I use the word strongest by using it on facts. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1805.1399999999999s)]
*  You know that during 15 years of war, the dollar liquidity of banks on average was 90 percent, sometimes 100 percent, something not seen anywhere. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1807.86s)]
*  So this tells you that financial collapse that you mentioned several times is not inevitable, was not inevitable. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1821.3s)]
*  It's a manmade collapse. It's a manmade collapse. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1829.1s)]
*  Two, you impute it to fiscal. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1833.4199999999998s)]
*  I'm sorry to say it's incorrect. It's incorrect. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1836.86s)]
*  Because the collapse has two sides. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1840.86s)]
*  One is the banking collapse. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1843.78s)]
*  The other is the exchange rate collapse, which is really minor. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1846.58s)]
*  When the exchange rate collapse in the late 80s in Lebanon, the pound lost more than 90 percent of its value in less than 12 months. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1851.02s)]
*  Banks remain very strong. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1859.78s)]
*  So perhaps it's better if you want to touch on this. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1861.86s)]
*  You have to go more into details. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1865.62s)]
*  I don't know whether there is scope in your paper for that, but I don't think it's appropriate to say that it has been it was inevitable, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1867.3s)]
*  and especially to impute it to all fiscal fact. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1874.8999999999999s)]
*  You have forgotten monetary policy, which to my mind, not general monetary policy, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1879.18s)]
*  the policy of the central bank of Lebanon, of the government, of what we call the central bank council, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1885.3400000000001s)]
*  it was support of banks, especially as illustrated by Panache and Girin, is the culprit, the culprit, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1893.38s)]
*  the criminal behind banking collapse. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1902.26s)]
*  And I proved it in a paper using official data. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1906.06s)]
*  So this is if you want to talk about financial collapse. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1909.74s)]
*  It's not the system that produced financial collapse. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1912.58s)]
*  It's specific policies. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1916.62s)]
*  Fiscal policy brought the collapse of the exchange rate with unsustainable debt level. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1919.1s)]
*  But monetary policy has brought the collapse of the banking system. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1925.62s)]
*  The two are different. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1929.78s)]
*  Also one detail. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1932.8999999999999s)]
*  You say that there has been a neoliberal shift, I think, in the 90s. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1934.1s)]
*  Lebanon has always been the epitome of neoliberalism since its creation. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1939.74s)]
*  Do you know that for more than 30, 40 years, it was the only laissez faire economy in the world? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1945.3799999999999s)]
*  Probably the only economy with free exchange rate and free capital movement. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1952.22s)]
*  So neoliberalism did not come to Lebanon recently. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1957.26s)]
*  In fact, whether we talk about political policies or economic policies, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1962.74s)]
*  Lebanon has systematically adopted the same stand since its independence. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1968.3s)]
*  I mean, when you talk about looting of the treasury, very high interest rates, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1978.46s)]
*  I would recommend that you substantiate this. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1982.18s)]
*  We can prove it. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1988.0600000000002s)]
*  In the book I put between 1993, 2002, I calculated so-called looted. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1990.3400000000001s)]
*  I don't call it looting. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1995.66s)]
*  I told it excessive interest rates of about $10 billion plus other ways of $6 billion. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=1997.46s)]
*  So I would recommend you stay away from these unless we have data to support it. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2004.58s)]
*  Overall, I really would like to compliment you on this paper. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2013.42s)]
*  But definitely, definitely, I mean, with all this work and you talk about political economy [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2017.7s)]
*  and the ruling elite, and then you end with just some improvement on tax system, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2025.18s)]
*  I would strongly recommend you reconsider and don't forget that our model is very different [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2033.82s)]
*  from that of the Paris School of Economics. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2040.82s)]
*  Not that it's bad, no, but it applies to a different environment, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2042.74s)]
*  different context and different economic structure. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2047.06s)]
*  Final comment on the situation, now what we can do. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2051.5s)]
*  I'm an economist and I strongly believe, I firmly believe, I said it publicly in the media [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2055.7s)]
*  and I wrote it, there is absolutely, absolutely, totally no solution in Lebanon, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2062.42s)]
*  no economic or financial or whatever you call it solution. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2069.78s)]
*  Before first we address the issue of occupation of Lebanon by Iran through their local arm, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2073.86s)]
*  Hezbollah. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2081.82s)]
*  A country under occupation cannot operate normally. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2082.86s)]
*  In fact, the only option that remained, which is the so-called Macron Plan. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2088.74s)]
*  What is the Macron Plan? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2094.62s)]
*  Macron Plan is saying, keep your political system as is, leave Hezbollah, stay with Iran, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2095.74s)]
*  but at least let's stop the collapse, let's maintain the collapse at least at the same level. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2101.3399999999997s)]
*  In other words, he was saying, if you are in a hole, stop digging. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2112.46s)]
*  Other than that, it's a waste of time. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2117.66s)]
*  Lebanon's fundamental problem is not economic. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2120.2999999999997s)]
*  Lebanon's fundamental problem is political. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2123.38s)]
*  It's a country that has been under occupation for half a century. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2127.54s)]
*  This is a fact. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2133.42s)]
*  It is as if when in Paris, in France, under German occupation, they would talk about fiscal reform. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2134.62s)]
*  Economically, we can talk, okay, let's see that this is a country under occupation, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2142.46s)]
*  but let's see what we can to make things not worse. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2147.7400000000002s)]
*  But the problem is not economic. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2154.1s)]
*  Tofi, I can stop you there just because we're more than halfway through the panel now, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2155.94s)]
*  and I want to have time to get to a few questions. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2161.1800000000003s)]
*  So in the course of a rather heated critique of Lydia's paper, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2165.14s)]
*  you raised some broader points about inequality in Lebanon, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2170.74s)]
*  the administrative capacity of the Lebanese state, the economic model in Lebanon. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2175.22s)]
*  So I have a question for all of you, but first I should say to everyone who is watching, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2181.4199999999996s)]
*  we've gotten a couple of questions already. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2186.7s)]
*  Please feel free to submit more via YouTube or Facebook or however it is you're watching this, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2188.66s)]
*  and I'll be reading out the questions that you've submitted as we go along for the next 20 or 25 minutes. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2195.06s)]
*  But to come back to this issue of taxation, which Lydia, of course, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2201.4199999999996s)]
*  this was one of your central recommendations in your paper, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2204.54s)]
*  and Tofi, you spoke about that at some length here. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2207.8199999999997s)]
*  A question for both of you, and Hanin, feel free to weigh in on this as well. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2211.98s)]
*  For Lydia, okay, so as you said, there are fundamental issues with tax evasion in Lebanon, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2217.2999999999997s)]
*  tax avoidance in Lebanon, a tax system that is structured in a somewhat regressive manner. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2222.3399999999997s)]
*  And you've suggested overhauling this, but that then begs the first the political question of how you accomplish that, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2229.5s)]
*  given the, let's say, political constraints that exist in Lebanon. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2236.26s)]
*  But then also a question of perhaps almost trust in the system and this issue of [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2241.02s)]
*  people don't really believe that their taxes are going to be spent well in Lebanon. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2249.38s)]
*  So not only overcoming the political problems at a government level, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2252.74s)]
*  but also overcoming this issue of trust on a popular level. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2256.82s)]
*  And for Tofi, if you dismiss the idea of a rolling the tax system in Lebanon as a means of addressing economic inequality, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2261.02s)]
*  what would you propose instead? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2270.9s)]
*  What? Sorry, what would I propose now in terms, frankly, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2275.7400000000002s)]
*  Macron's, if we abstract from the political considerations and we say, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2281.34s)]
*  fine, there is nothing we can do, what can we do to improve things? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2288.46s)]
*  Fine, that's a relevant question. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2293.6200000000003s)]
*  It's a practical question. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2295.5800000000004s)]
*  My answer is the following. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2297.6600000000003s)]
*  Macron plan, Macron plan is really aiming not to improve situation. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2302.5s)]
*  It is aiming to stop the deterioration, which is a good approach because by bringing in a government that is, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2308.54s)]
*  if you may say, apolitical, Lebanon could get some aid and stay for a while. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2318.2599999999998s)]
*  But this is politically unrealistic because effectively what it is saying, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2324.62s)]
*  it is telling Lydia's ruling elite, it is telling them, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2332.14s)]
*  listen, we are going to take the reins, do with the economy, whatever we want, and you watch us. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2336.22s)]
*  It will never happen. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2342.3399999999997s)]
*  It will never happen. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2344.02s)]
*  We can speculate at Noseyam about all these issues, about this income policy, that tax policy or that monetary policy. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2345.3799999999997s)]
*  It I'm afraid it won't be useful. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2355.7799999999997s)]
*  It doesn't help. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2359.3399999999997s)]
*  The chicken have come home to roost. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2361.62s)]
*  What we have witnessed is the biggest banking collapse in modern history. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2364.9s)]
*  It has happened about a year and four months ago. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2372.1000000000004s)]
*  What did the authorities do so far to address it? [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2375.82s)]
*  Zero. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2380.02s)]
*  This is remarkable. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2383.26s)]
*  Yes, I think we all agree on this. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2384.6200000000003s)]
*  I think we do all agree on this and I think I say this very upfront in the paper. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2388.2599999999998s)]
*  So I think Greg actually asked the core and the true question, and I don't give an answer in the paper, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2395.3799999999997s)]
*  is that of course, increasing tax revenues is necessary. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2401.94s)]
*  We need money now in Lebanon and a way to do it is not to wait for outside aid, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2406.7799999999997s)]
*  but actually try to find money within the country. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2413.2999999999997s)]
*  But then once we collected more money, what do we do with it if we give it in the hand of people that are corrupted [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2416.26s)]
*  and that never invested in good investments and that actually have the population? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2422.5s)]
*  It won't be better. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2430.1400000000003s)]
*  So this I don't have an answer about this. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2431.38s)]
*  And that's what I say in the paper is that the entire system is corrupted, is deeply flooded. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2433.82s)]
*  So we really need to create a new virtuous circle where there is more trust, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2440.82s)]
*  that citizens are agreed to pay more taxes to give it to a government they can trust in [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2446.86s)]
*  and that will invest it in efficient policies for the common good. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2451.6200000000003s)]
*  I don't have like this must be decided politically, democratically. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2458.38s)]
*  I am not the one who can say what's the form of the political transition and what can happen. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2461.82s)]
*  What I can say as an economist and specialist about fiscal and inequality is that one good point, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2468.98s)]
*  if we need a bullet point of reforms and to rethink the economic model is that with regard to taxation, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2474.7000000000003s)]
*  like there is a large margin of maneuver, obviously, and I think it is said clearly in the paper, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2483.1s)]
*  this is not the panacea. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2490.26s)]
*  It's not tax reform that will help Lebanon now. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2491.78s)]
*  It's not like if we increase the tax rate that all the problems will be solved. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2494.82s)]
*  I think no one believes this and I clearly didn't say this. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2499.5400000000004s)]
*  But now the big question is to create a new state in Lebanon, a new social contract. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2504.34s)]
*  And taxation is key. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2509.34s)]
*  I mean, taxes is really the definition of a stable and long term state and a state that cannot tax its citizen [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2510.46s)]
*  and its richest citizen in particular cannot last long. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2518.1000000000004s)]
*  So that's why tax reform must be one of course, a set of policies and a way mostly to find money [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2521.94s)]
*  within the country now, especially when we look at the tax bases of the richest. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2531.02s)]
*  And if I can very quickly answer a bit to the comments to fix that. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2536.3s)]
*  Thanks a lot for your feedback. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2540.14s)]
*  And actually, I agree on many of what you said. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2541.7400000000002s)]
*  Like inequality is not new at all. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2544.1s)]
*  I never said this. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2546.2200000000003s)]
*  We don't have data before 2005, but I agree with you that probably we have a country with [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2547.18s)]
*  like extreme inequality since the 60s before the civil war. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2553.1s)]
*  And I actually say this, that the neoliberal policy is not something new. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2558.2599999999998s)]
*  It was reaffirmed in the 90s, but the country has always opted for laissez faire, etc. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2564.2599999999998s)]
*  So I completely agree. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2570.5s)]
*  And that's what I say in the paper. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2571.3799999999997s)]
*  It's really not new. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2573.1s)]
*  We have like dynasties in Lebanon for quite some time. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2573.9s)]
*  And if I can quickly answer to what you said before taking the question. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2578.98s)]
*  And that no, like there was no actually. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2594.9s)]
*  So it's not like what is new is to have actually figures that track the entire national income. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2603.14s)]
*  The one of the in the 60s, the one you're quoting was only for the roots. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2613.94s)]
*  It's where like fine confirm from the World Bank, both can have a public data like the [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2617.7000000000003s)]
*  Gini coefficient on income was low, but because we know that the survey data is not good and [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2623.7s)]
*  the World Bank knows it very, very well. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2628.74s)]
*  So on this, like I disagree, but perhaps we can take more questions. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2631.62s)]
*  Yes. And if we can also bring Hanin back in, because I feel like she's just been sitting [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2639.62s)]
*  there quietly for the past half hour or so. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2645.06s)]
*  First of all, a question that was submitted in the comments asking about maybe this is [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2648.3399999999997s)]
*  something you can speak to about the explosion, the explosion in August and whether that's had [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2653.54s)]
*  any impact on economic inequality in Lebanon. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2659.06s)]
*  Don't know why that just popped up on the screen. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2663.7799999999997s)]
*  And then also a question on my end, which is what you talked about with under investment [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2666.74s)]
*  in education, for example, you mentioned that Lydia mentioned that you can go down the list of [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2674.9s)]
*  basic services in Lebanon and many of them are underfunded and under supported. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2681.86s)]
*  And I would imagine it becomes a vicious cycle vis-a-vis economic inequality. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2685.62s)]
*  What are the and it's going to get worse in the coming years as budgets are crimped and [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2692.02s)]
*  as the Lebanese government has less and less money to spend on these services. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2696.66s)]
*  What's the impact of this in the medium term, in the long term, if there isn't some kind of [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2700.9s)]
*  concerted action to support again, things like education? [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2705.54s)]
*  Thank you, Greg. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2711.94s)]
*  I mean, to answer your question immediately, impact could be very devastating. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2713.38s)]
*  We know that when households or families for any for economic reasons or whatever, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2720.42s)]
*  put their children out of school because of increased poverty, that this has a generation [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2726.1s)]
*  effect and down the road, Lebanon's human capital for whatever it was, will just continue to [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2731.46s)]
*  deteriorate. So this needs to be arrested now. I mean, addressed now because it has long term [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2738.42s)]
*  impacts. So the answer is that absolutely it's a very urgent matter. And this is something that [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2743.62s)]
*  with World Bank, we have a new program that will be addressing exactly that. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2749.06s)]
*  The dropout of children from school. But I think you're right. I mean, right now, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2756.1800000000003s)]
*  the whole fiscal situation is very difficult. And where do you cut? I think what the [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2760.5s)]
*  authorities need to think about is where to spend better. So within the education sector, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2768.18s)]
*  within the health sector, where you can have efficiency gains in the kind of spending that [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2775.3799999999997s)]
*  expenditure that the government is doing. This is something that and there are, I mean, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2785.62s)]
*  there's huge inefficiencies in the sectors. But I mean, I also want to agree a little bit with [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2789.46s)]
*  Dofi that it's going to require political consensus. Each of these reforms are very [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2796.58s)]
*  difficult, even in normal times. Pension reform, education, universal health, social protection. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2801.06s)]
*  And we need strong leadership, a very, you know, tough measures have to be taken, but people have [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2809.46s)]
*  to be consulted. The whole, the big question that has been discussed for past years about the [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2818.98s)]
*  distribution of losses. I mean, indeed, the poor need to be protected, even, you know, lower [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2826.5s)]
*  middle income households need to be protected from this adjustment. And somehow, that, you know, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2832.42s)]
*  contribution to the losses has to be looked at from maybe, you know, other more wealthier segments. So [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2839.38s)]
*  it's going to be difficult next few years, five to 10 years. Lebanon hasn't even started on the [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2847.14s)]
*  reform agenda. So and time is passing. So to say that absolutely this is, it's a very critical [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2852.66s)]
*  moment that can have long term impact. One question about the impact of the Beirut blast on inequality. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2861.14s)]
*  So we really don't have figures on that. The only thing we were able to estimate was in terms of the [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2867.06s)]
*  impact of the Beirut blast was that it added because of the loss of the physical stock from [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2873.06s)]
*  the port primarily, but also from the housing and the like, another point four to point six percent [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2878.9s)]
*  of GDP to be negative on top of what already was a decline. But it's hard to really figure out if [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2886.6600000000003s)]
*  there's any impact on further inequality. Thank you. Thank you. We have a couple of questions here [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2893.78s)]
*  that are related to politics, which I guess we can just lump together and ask for any of you. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2903.38s)]
*  What is possible, is anything possible vis-a-vis economic inequality, addressing economic [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2913.62s)]
*  inequality without meaningful political or constitutional or electoral reform in Lebanon? [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2918.42s)]
*  Well, at the most fundamental level, any improvement would have to come with economic growth [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2925.14s)]
*  in the sense of more income growth, more job opportunities. Other than that, it's very [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2939.2999999999997s)]
*  difficult to imagine specifically in the case of Lebanon, other positive scenario, especially [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2947.46s)]
*  the situation. So the resumption of economic growth would need some, definitely it's a prerequisite, [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2953.62s)]
*  financial cleanup. And the financial cleanup usually is associated or has an important component, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2963.22s)]
*  which is fiscal cleanup that Haneed was talking about that. And therein lies the problem, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2972.58s)]
*  because the political system is one of sharing of spoils, not increasing the spoils. So in other [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2977.7799999999997s)]
*  words, when there will be fiscal or financial reform, whatever it is, they're going to come [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2985.7799999999997s)]
*  against the problem of this political system where the authorities are more interested in sharing [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2990.8199999999997s)]
*  the spoils than anything else. But reducing inequality, any reduction in inequality, well, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=2998.3399999999997s)]
*  time has sold out, so not only in Lebanon but also elsewhere, we need some economic growth, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3006.3399999999997s)]
*  which I don't see in the foreseeable future. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3013.62s)]
*  I mean, I disagree with this because now we've known that since the 80s, everywhere in the world, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3019.62s)]
*  is everywhere in the world, including in Lebanon, growth has been captured by [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3032.18s)]
*  the richest. So now we know that the theories of the trickle down is that if there is growth [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3039.22s)]
*  and if everyone increases and if the richest get richer, everyone benefit from it. We know [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3044.42s)]
*  now that is not true. It's not the case. So increasing growth now in Lebanon, so I repeat [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3051.06s)]
*  what you told me, but actually I really think that the problem is clearly political. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3058.9s)]
*  And like under the constitution, like that needs to be a political transition. I don't know the [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3062.7400000000002s)]
*  form that this would take, but alone right now by simple, like isolated policies, economic policies, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3068.1s)]
*  it won't be enough. The economic alone cannot be enough now. So the answer should be political. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3075.62s)]
*  But then again, like this must be decided collectively. So it's tough to know what form [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3084.42s)]
*  it will take. So Haneen, we have a question here asking if free university tuition or tuition [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3091.7000000000003s)]
*  ceilings would help with the decline in human capital development and education. Lydia, a [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3100.58s)]
*  question for you asking if progressive taxes are sustainable in the Lebanese context. And then a [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3107.2200000000003s)]
*  question for me, also Lydia, for you. One thing that hasn't come up is the question of subsidies [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3113.86s)]
*  in Lebanon. Of course, as we said at the beginning, there's sort of this looming deadline [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3120.82s)]
*  beyond which the central bank may not be able to sustain them anymore. Do they have any role or [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3126.9s)]
*  have they had any role in the issue of economic inequality in Lebanon? [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3132.1s)]
*  So if you want me quickly to take some of that, the question about what a free university tuition [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3137.6200000000003s)]
*  or tuition ceilings help the decline. I mean, you certainly want to help those who don't have [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3142.98s)]
*  the means to be able to reach, you know, to continue with their investment in education. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3149.54s)]
*  So programs like scholarships and what have you, yes, are would help and are needed. And [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3156.6600000000003s)]
*  I mentioned earlier the program that we're now putting in place for social assistance, social [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3163.94s)]
*  safety, and it has a big focus on also trying to make sure that this is for pre-tertiary, but that [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3167.86s)]
*  all costs of education are paid for families among poor income levels. The question will be [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3175.14s)]
*  how to finance it. I mean, this is where Lebanon is today, any programs, they're all needed, but [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3180.66s)]
*  how is it going to be financed? And this is where one starts to talk about the financial crisis. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3186.42s)]
*  One starts to talk about a macro framework, fiscal framework, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3192.58s)]
*  in a reform package, which all has to be done. But I do want to maybe point to something also that, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3197.06s)]
*  yes, you need economic growth, you need job creation. Lydia is right in the sense that in [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3204.58s)]
*  the past economic growth in Lebanon has not necessarily meant poverty reduction because [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3210.1s)]
*  we haven't seen that virtual cycle through job creation. Most of the jobs that got created in [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3216.5s)]
*  Lebanon were low productivity, low income jobs, nevertheless kind of informal jobs. So it hasn't [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3221.14s)]
*  really added to this increase in welfare of households. So there is something to be, you [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3227.8599999999997s)]
*  know, economic growth is almost necessary, but it's obviously not sufficient. And there are policies, [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3237.62s)]
*  as I was alluding to in capital human development, social assistance programs. I mean, cash transfer [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3242.74s)]
*  programs have been proven across the world through serious evaluations that especially in times of [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3249.06s)]
*  crisis, if scaled up and well targeted to reach the poor can help them through these difficult [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3254.58s)]
*  times, can help in reducing poverty and over time can help to reduce inequality. This is the Latin [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3260.82s)]
*  American experience in Brazil, for example, inequality actually was reduced strongly by [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3266.1s)]
*  social assistance or cash transfer programs. So there are ways and we are working on trying to [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3274.1000000000004s)]
*  put in place some of these programs, at least at this period of very critical crises that Lebanon [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3282.26s)]
*  is going through. Over. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3288.5s)]
*  Lydia, sorry, anything from you on either this question about the sustainability of [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3298.02s)]
*  progressive taxation in Lebanon or about subsidies and where economics or government [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3302.98s)]
*  subsidies fit into the question of inequality? [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3309.78s)]
*  Yeah, sorry, there was again a connection problem. So I didn't hear the end, but just to answer the [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3320.58s)]
*  question that were asked about. So, yes, about the progressivity, I think there is a large, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3328.9s)]
*  that's what I was saying. There is a large margin of maneuver in Lebanon in the sense that you do [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3335.86s)]
*  not need to be a radical leftist to believe about the reforms I propose. Lebanon is really doing [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3341.46s)]
*  quite badly in this regard. So just improving a little bit would just make it really is possible. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3351.14s)]
*  And actually also actually an answer to what to fix that earlier. It is actually possible to do [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3360.9s)]
*  this new research by Julien Alonso Nouvelles, for example, fascinating research about Colombia [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3368.02s)]
*  showed that actually introducing a wealth tax in a developing country can be effective. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3373.94s)]
*  Do we have an efficient, even if the context is not like you could think that it would not be [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3381.3s)]
*  efficient because of corruption. So, so no, I think it's doable. Again, conditional on having [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3388.1s)]
*  the right political system around and about the subsidies. So I'm not an expert actually on the [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3395.54s)]
*  subsidies and the one that exists in it's not necessarily something bad if it helps that the [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3403.62s)]
*  poorest, but something more general and systematic and making the richest pay more would be much [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3410.18s)]
*  fairer. And now we know that social justice really needs to be a priority given the level [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3416.98s)]
*  of poverty Hani was talking about inequality that I presented. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3422.3399999999997s)]
*  Okay. I think we've gotten through most of the viewer questions and unfortunately, we've also [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3426.66s)]
*  gotten through most of our time. It feels like a lot of these conversations about whether it's [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3435.46s)]
*  poverty, whether it's inequality, whatever economic problem one is discussing in Lebanon, [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3441.8599999999997s)]
*  like they become these frustratingly circular conversations where economic change or economic [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3446.2599999999998s)]
*  reform becomes impossible absent political reform. But at the same time, when you have a country [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3453.7s)]
*  that is plunged into the sort of economic crisis that Lebanon is in at the moment, it also may [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3459.22s)]
*  serve to reinforce the current political system and therefore make economic change even further [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3466.2599999999998s)]
*  away. It's just feels like again, it's hard to even know where to start this question of can you [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3474.1s)]
*  have economic reform without political reform? It's almost like you have to somehow be able to [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3480.18s)]
*  do both at the same time. Okay. So with that, I think we're going to wrap up. Thank you very much [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3484.66s)]
*  to all of our panelists, Lydia Aswad, Taufik Gaspard and Hani Ensayed. Thank you to all of [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmFA1Bi35s&t=3492.74s)]
