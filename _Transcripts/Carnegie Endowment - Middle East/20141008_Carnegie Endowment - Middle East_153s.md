# Brown on Egypt’s Resurgent Authoritarianism
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [October 08, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XDT5Ntijg)
*  It's been clear for some time that Egypt is not moving in a democratic direction. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XDT5Ntijg&t=0.0s)]
*  What's become clear over the last few months is the shape of authoritarianism that is emerging. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XDT5Ntijg&t=15.8s)]
*  What President Sisi is doing right now is issuing a series of laws that will allow the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XDT5Ntijg&t=22.0s)]
*  Egyptian state tremendous discretion to operate as it sees fit through the regular legal channels, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XDT5Ntijg&t=28.04s)]
*  through regular institutional channels, rather than construct this entire side system outside of the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XDT5Ntijg&t=35.32s)]
*  law. Egypt has a very set of very strong state institutions, a judiciary, bureaucracy, security, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XDT5Ntijg&t=40.96s)]
*  apparatus, and military, and so on. And they're basically just used to running the show. They're [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XDT5Ntijg&t=47.32s)]
*  used to coming up with their own definition of what the national interest is and pursuing it, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XDT5Ntijg&t=51.72s)]
*  guided by a very, very strong presidency. Now, all that system came under severe challenge in [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XDT5Ntijg&t=56.32s)]
*  2011 with a mass popular uprising. And what's happening right now is that those institutions [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XDT5Ntijg&t=61.84s)]
*  are basically trying to find a way to reestablish their authority after that popular uprising and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XDT5Ntijg&t=67.44s)]
*  after a period of Muslim Brotherhood rule, which challenged it in some different ways. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XDT5Ntijg&t=73.08s)]
*  In the past, a lot of the way that Egyptian authoritarianism operated was you had a normal [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XDT5Ntijg&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  set of laws and institutions, and then you had ways that were recognized by law of basically [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XDT5Ntijg&t=82.04s)]
*  moving outside that system. So you had a state of emergency that was in near continuous effect [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XDT5Ntijg&t=87.80000000000001s)]
*  that allowed the officials, if they wanted to get a case out of the normal legal system, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XDT5Ntijg&t=92.64s)]
*  to put into a special system. What's going on right now is a different set of laws that are [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XDT5Ntijg&t=97.28s)]
*  being written that essentially will be permanently on the books. They won't be exceptional measures. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XDT5Ntijg&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  They will be ways of giving very, very broad latitude to officials to do as they see fit. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XDT5Ntijg&t=107.08000000000001s)]
*  Egypt doesn't have a parliament right now. What President Sisi is doing right now is using that [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XDT5Ntijg&t=115.04s)]
*  constitutional vacuum to issue a whole series of laws on really some fundamental matters that will [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XDT5Ntijg&t=120.04s)]
*  then be submitted to the parliament, but a parliament that will be unlikely to be able to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XDT5Ntijg&t=126.12s)]
*  muster a majority against them. So the effect is basically to lay down the fundamental structures [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XDT5Ntijg&t=131.04000000000002s)]
*  of the Egyptian state apparatus while there is no parliament, and basically so the president [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XDT5Ntijg&t=136.84s)]
*  is giving the state institutions all these authorities while there is no real oversight. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XDT5Ntijg&t=142.52s)]
