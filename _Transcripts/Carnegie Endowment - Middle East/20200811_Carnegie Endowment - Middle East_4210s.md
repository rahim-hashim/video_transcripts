Video Description: A massive explosion in Beirut shattered glass miles away, killing more than 100, wounding thousands, and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless. Now Lebanon finds itself in a severe political, economic, and humanitarian crisis. How can the people of Beirut rebuild their lives while still sheltering from a global pandemic? What are the immediate political and economic implications of this pivotal moment in Lebanese history, and what political change is necessary for true recovery to be possible? 

Join us on Tuesday, August 11, for a panel conversation with leading Lebanese experts Ishac Diwan, Paul Salem, Maha Yahya, and Kim Ghattas as they discuss the way forward for the people of Lebanon and their political future.

*  A week after the devastating explosion at Beirut port that killed 200 people, injured [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=25.88s)]

*  There have been protests, there's been violence. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=43.120000000000005s)]

*  I'd like to point out also at the onset of the conversation that we're going to go on [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=113.32s)]
*  a little bit beyond the hour so that we can bring you all in to hopefully hear what will [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  happen at 6.06 in Beirut, at Beirut time, one week after the terrific, the horrifying [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  explosion at Beirut port. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=130.16s)]
*  The church bells in Beirut will toll and the call to prayer will sound to commemorate those [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=132.12s)]
*  who died in this horrific event. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=137.48s)]
*  I want to start, Maha, with you here in Beirut. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=140.44s)]
*  You were here when it happened. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=143.48s)]
*  Your offices at Carnegie in downtown were shattered, luckily. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=145.56s)]
*  Everyone was safe. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=150.76s)]
*  There were some injuries. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=151.76s)]
*  But we want to hear from you first about how it feels a week later. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=153.67999999999998s)]
*  How does Beirut feel? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=158.16s)]
*  Tell the world, tell those who are listening in. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=159.48s)]
*  There's been protests, there have been protests, there's been anger, there's talk of revenge. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=161.12s)]
*  What did this explosion do to Beirut and to Lebanon? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=166.84s)]
*  It's hard to capture, Kim, in so many words. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=171.76s)]
*  First, hi, everybody. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=177.28s)]
*  It's good to see good friends on the screen. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=179.0s)]
*  It's very hard to capture in words. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=182.72s)]
*  It's been an incredibly hard week emotionally, mentally and physically on all fronts. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=184.44s)]
*  The city is in an aftershock mode. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=192.44s)]
*  I don't think people have yet processed what happened. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=195.72s)]
*  Everybody just jumped in immediately into a rescue mission. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=201.04s)]
*  So what has truly been remarkable are two trends that are actually long-time trends [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=205.52s)]
*  in Lebanon, where the moment there is a crisis, everybody jumps in and you see this amazing, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=211.44s)]
*  amazing sense of social solidarity. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=220.0s)]
*  People taking the initiative, going down to the streets, kids, parents, grandparents [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=224.08s)]
*  from all walks of life, from all parts of Lebanon, coming together to try and heal the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=230.96s)]
*  city, help the wounded, find the missing and do what they can. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=238.76000000000002s)]
*  And that's part of the reason the state has been absent, isn't that right? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=245.56s)]
*  We haven't seen... [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=248.96s)]
*  That was the second trend. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=249.96s)]
*  That was the second trend, which is this has been complemented by a total absence by state [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=252.44s)]
*  of state institutions. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=257.6s)]
*  They simply are not there. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=259.08s)]
*  The municipality is barely visible. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=262.36s)]
*  None of the ministries have been around. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=266.52s)]
*  Even the rescue mission has been botched up by the government to the point where it's [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=269.28s)]
*  actually cost the lives of a few more people, people who could have been saved. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=276.64s)]
*  So the absence of the state and the presence of people is something that I think is not [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=281.64s)]
*  unique. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=287.47999999999996s)]
*  I mean, it's been very clear at this particular moment and in a jarring way because of the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=288.47999999999996s)]
*  nature of the crisis. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=295.52s)]
*  And there's an explosion that damaged almost half the city. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=296.84s)]
*  It's the best, I mean, not the best, but it's an example of the kind of criminal neglect [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=301.76s)]
*  this political class has had and the way in which they've handled not only this particular, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=310.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, having almost 3000 tons of ammonium nitrate in the heart of the city, Beirut grew [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=319.0s)]
*  around its port. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=325.52s)]
*  This isn't some remote area. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=327.08s)]
*  So in the middle of residential areas in the heart of the city, but also the way they've [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=329.4s)]
*  handled the country in general, there's this complete disregard. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=334.79999999999995s)]
*  And in this case, it borders on criminality and we see that every level and the way they've [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=339.36s)]
*  dealt with the economic crisis and the way they've handled the question of political [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=345.96s)]
*  legitimacy. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=350.36s)]
*  So everywhere you look, the sense of not caring for the population is very palpable. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=351.8s)]
*  The anger is there. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=362.2s)]
*  The anger is this, this I think was a kind of a tipping point. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=364.48s)]
*  So you have a government that was to my mind already a lame duck government, has been a [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=369.92s)]
*  lame duck government for some time because it just was not delivering. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=374.4s)]
*  It couldn't take any kind of leadership role on anything. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=378.36s)]
*  The explosion, I think, just accelerated the process of its demise because at this point, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=382.92s)]
*  people said enough is enough. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=388.92s)]
*  I mean, those that hadn't said it were now saying it. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=390.2s)]
*  And the anger is just so much stronger because the sense is, you know, we either fight for [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=393.36s)]
*  this country or that's it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=400.64s)]
*  There's really nothing left and accountability. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=402.72s)]
*  So much to unpack in that one answer that we'll go through during the conversation. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=408.72s)]
*  Can you tell us very briefly where things are at with the investigation? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=414.44s)]
*  Because it's becoming clear that everyone at the highest levels knew about the presence [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=419.08000000000004s)]
*  of this ammonium nitrate at the port. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=425.0s)]
*  They certainly knew it emerged as of the last couple of days that the actually report was [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=428.64000000000004s)]
*  filed and sent to both the president and the prime minister detailing the fact that these [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=435.04s)]
*  the three almost three thousand tons of ammonium nitrate were in the port badly stored and [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=442.28s)]
*  what that actually apparently one of the one part of the report says if this explodes, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=449.2s)]
*  it will wipe out the city. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=455.64s)]
*  So that was already there. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=457.12s)]
*  The investigation is ongoing. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=459.4s)]
*  There are too many loopholes in the narrative, which has actually opened the story to [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=461.44s)]
*  multiple interpretations, a lot of theories floating around in terms of both what caused [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=467.88s)]
*  them the flare, the explosion itself. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=473.84s)]
*  Was it a missile? Was it an accident? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=478.64s)]
*  What was it? But also there are loopholes in the story of why was this ammonium nitrate [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=480.79999999999995s)]
*  at the port to start with? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=487.2s)]
*  This was a ship that was not meant to come to Lebanon and yet ended up in Beirut's port, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=489.08s)]
*  unloaded this valuable cargo million dollar. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=494.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's worth a lot of money and yet it's become an orphan cargo. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=497.24s)]
*  Nobody's asked for it in the last six, seven years. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=500.76s)]
*  It's very bizarre. So we have there are lots of unanswered questions that we have to wait [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=503.64s)]
*  for. As I want to turn to you to discuss the assessment of the immediate economic impact. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=509.03999999999996s)]
*  We'll talk a little bit later on about the macro picture and everything that Lebanon's [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=518.92s)]
*  already been going through and the economic and financial crisis that it has endured over [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=523.16s)]
*  the last year almost. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=528.36s)]
*  But can you give us an immediate assessment of the impact, the losses calculated so far, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=530.68s)]
*  the humanitarian needs? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=537.04s)]
*  And that's, of course, the human loss and the trauma that this country is living is [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=538.5600000000001s)]
*  huge on its own. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=543.96s)]
*  But tell us more about the immediate losses and the humanitarian needs. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=545.24s)]
*  And how should aid be channeled when people on the streets are very clearly saying they [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=549.0799999999999s)]
*  don't trust the government to handle the channeling and the disbursement of the aid [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=556.52s)]
*  money that may be coming in? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=562.52s)]
*  Well, thanks, Kim. These are exactly the right questions on people's mind. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=564.7199999999999s)]
*  And hello, everyone. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=568.92s)]
*  Assessments are ongoing. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=570.4399999999999s)]
*  So I think it's too early to say some hard numbers. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=571.8s)]
*  Some numbers have been floated by. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=575.24s)]
*  But civil society is really very active on the ground right now, not just clearing the [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=577.36s)]
*  debris, but also assessing what's happening. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=583.1999999999999s)]
*  The unions of engineers and architects, schools association, health associations, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=586.64s)]
*  microcredit traders are getting organized to think about exactly those questions, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=594.04s)]
*  assessing the needs and then how to get organized so that the help goes directly. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=599.72s)]
*  And is managed properly from from the work that's going on. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=604.6800000000001s)]
*  I think we can classify losses and needs for compensation, perhaps in six categories [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=608.96s)]
*  very quickly. The human hurt, you know, people dead, wounded, of course, but also those [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=615.08s)]
*  displaced, those that have lost their jobs. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=622.92s)]
*  How would that process deal with them? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=625.6800000000001s)]
*  Second, our assets destroyed, of course, the port, which is the heart of Lebanon. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=629.2s)]
*  But also several neighborhoods, housing, businesses, 37 schools. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=634.1999999999999s)]
*  Docs and four major hospitals, electricity connections. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=642.04s)]
*  No, many public goods have been destroyed as well. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=647.8s)]
*  Third, business losses. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=651.48s)]
*  These were areas with lots of small businesses and a lot of the creative businesses and [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=653.8s)]
*  doctors, dentists and others that that are that [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=659.68s)]
*  where the offices have been destroyed, but also that have losing income and are not [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=665.72s)]
*  going to be able to restart their businesses without support. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=670.6s)]
*  Fourth, there is very important disruption to trade, given that 80 percent of the trade [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=674.72s)]
*  goes through that port, which would increase prices. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=679.28s)]
*  They'd have to go to smaller ports without inflation. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=682.96s)]
*  Fifth, there are fiscal losses, very important revenues going to the government, accruing [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=686.8s)]
*  from the ports. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=691.7199999999999s)]
*  And finally, there is a very important cultural heritage in that area that also needs to [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=693.64s)]
*  be repaired. So civil society is thinking about how to get involved. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=699.4399999999999s)]
*  There are two important missions on the ground right now from the World Bank and from the [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=704.12s)]
*  UN agencies. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=708.28s)]
*  Last Sunday's donor met and already put together a package of two hundred fifty million [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=710.4000000000001s)]
*  dollars for emergency aid, food, shelter, health and the like. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=715.6400000000001s)]
*  But the big donor conference is planned for September. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=720.9200000000001s)]
*  A priori, they would disperse through UN agencies and the World Bank is talking of [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=725.2800000000001s)]
*  putting together a multi donor trust fund to pool these funds. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=729.84s)]
*  And I think there's a major challenge there to organize the governance of these funds. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=734.2s)]
*  So that civil society plays a key role in deciding the principles of compensation and [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=739.44s)]
*  distributions, but also the channels through which it goes, we will execute on the ground [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=746.5200000000001s)]
*  and also, very importantly, how to prevent clientelistic groups from kind of infiltrating [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=752.96s)]
*  in this movement to benefit from from that manner coming to Beirut. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=758.84s)]
*  So talking to civil society groups right now and really paradoxically, there is hope [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=763.68s)]
*  they are they are working, they're busy, they feel much more empowered to to to rebuild [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=771.0799999999999s)]
*  and and to change things, to to hold the future in their own hands. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=777.88s)]
*  Let me pause here for a moment. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=783.52s)]
*  I want to go back. I want to come back to you with more on the economy, but I want to [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=785.3599999999999s)]
*  bring in Maha and Paul on this last point. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=789.64s)]
*  Maha, first, I'd love you to comment some more on what this has done to the heritage, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=793.52s)]
*  because you talk a little bit about it in a great piece that you wrote for Carnegie's [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=798.2s)]
*  D1 blog, Can Lebanon's Fires Be Put Out? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=803.64s)]
*  The port, as you said, is really at the heart of the city. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=806.8s)]
*  It's been disheartening also to see the damage done to some of the area's heritage, the [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=810.96s)]
*  old houses, the beautiful mansions that were that somehow survived 15 years of civil war. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=817.36s)]
*  And then, Paul, I want to bring you in on the crisis, the political crisis that we're [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=825.4s)]
*  on, that we're in now and that we've been in for the last nine months and how this [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=830.76s)]
*  aggravates everything. But Maha, just tell us a little bit more about the heritage and [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=833.8399999999999s)]
*  and what's been damaged beyond the infrastructure. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=839.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, you mentioned the two areas or the three areas that were most hit by the [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=842.4s)]
*  explosion are very much the last remaining Ottoman slash French mandate neighborhoods [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=850.52s)]
*  where the existing houses that have been there since the turn of the 19th century have yet [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=861.72s)]
*  have not been demolished and have not been replaced by skyscrapers. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=869.2s)]
*  Of course, I'm talking about Jermayzi, Marmkhayel, Arts of Ashrafie, but also the area that [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=874.1600000000001s)]
*  is known as Zad Le Blat, which is a bit further up, but which also has a lot of old [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=882.08s)]
*  buildings, again, Ottoman to French, and that was also hit by the blast. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=888.5200000000001s)]
*  So the concern here is that and we're already hearing stories about different development [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=893.04s)]
*  they're being called development vultures now who are trying to move in to see which [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=900.76s)]
*  houses can be I mean, the house has just collapsed under the force of the blast. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=906.5600000000001s)]
*  You have houses that are made out of stone and they they did survive 15 years of civil [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=912.44s)]
*  war, but they could not survive the force of the blast. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=918.64s)]
*  So they've completely collapsed. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=921.36s)]
*  The concern here is that because of the economic crisis, the owners of these structures may be [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=922.72s)]
*  tempted to sell these structures, particularly because Lebanon does not have a law to [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=929.8000000000001s)]
*  protect cultural heritage of this nature. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=935.52s)]
*  For some reason, this is what I won't go into the history, but it's a French law which [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=937.88s)]
*  considers cultural heritage anything that is from 1700 backwards. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=942.72s)]
*  But anything forwards is not part of cultural heritage and you have to fight for it. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=947.12s)]
*  So bottom line is the concern is people might sell and we will lose what is left of [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=951.16s)]
*  the city's historic core. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=959.84s)]
*  Yeah, well, I want to turn to you and pick up on something that this talk just said about [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=962.04s)]
*  this moment of hope amidst the tragedy. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=966.04s)]
*  That's quite an incredible statement, but I've sensed it as well around me that from [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=969.92s)]
*  this tragedy, is it possible that there is a moment where the country can rebuild and [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=974.9200000000001s)]
*  move forward in a better direction? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=979.8000000000001s)]
*  Because as we've been saying, this is not just been a humanitarian disaster. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=982.5600000000001s)]
*  It is also part of a political crisis wrapped in an economic crisis. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=986.12s)]
*  And it comes after nine months of protests, the pandemic lockdown, a government [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=990.08s)]
*  resignation in November. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=995.12s)]
*  Yesterday, Hassan Jab's government's cabinet resigned as well. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=996.84s)]
*  Is this a moment that is different in Lebanon's history? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1004.6s)]
*  Is there any reason to be hopeful? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1009.0400000000001s)]
*  And is the resignation of Hassan Jab's cabinet actually a victory for the protesters or [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1011.9200000000001s)]
*  is this the beginning of a long protracted process? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1019.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think definitely like many large crises, it shakes up the status quo. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1023.4s)]
*  Lebanon already had a massive socioeconomic crisis, already had a massive political [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1029.2s)]
*  uprising or revolution on its hands. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1034.16s)]
*  This devastating event obviously makes probably all of that more acute. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1037.08s)]
*  And I've been in touch with so many friends and family members and groups in Lebanon. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1043.08s)]
*  And given how vibrant civil society is and how vibrant, you know, a lot of Lebanese are, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1048.6s)]
*  you see that energy and insistence on life and on rebuilding and on not giving up. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1054.72s)]
*  And that energy is very essential. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1060.44s)]
*  Yes, when we step back and sort of assess kind of the crisis that the regime, the [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1064.88s)]
*  oligarchy, the system is in, it is obviously a very, very profound crisis, which [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1071.76s)]
*  logically creates opportunities for change. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1077.96s)]
*  But it is difficult and very complicated. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1080.28s)]
*  The regime's economic basis, its political economy, collapsed eight, nine months ago. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1083.92s)]
*  In other words, the money and the Ponzi scheme that was funding 30 years of this [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1090.56s)]
*  type of oligarchy that already had collapsed. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1097.1200000000001s)]
*  There already had been a historic uprising, the likes of which Lebanon hasn't seen maybe [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1101.64s)]
*  since the 1950s or something similar in the 60s, where large cross sections of the [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1107.28s)]
*  population across sectarian lines united against corruption and involvement in [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1113.6s)]
*  regional wars and all the rest of it. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1120.76s)]
*  I think this blast, yes, I mean, when you look at the immediate and the deep effects, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1123.76s)]
*  one, it is now dealt a death blow to the second government since the revolution. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1130.52s)]
*  So you might say the revolution or protests have brought down already two [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1137.3600000000001s)]
*  governments in the span of nine months. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1142.64s)]
*  That shows the power of the people power and the vulnerability of the ruling clique [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1146.32s)]
*  that exists. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1155.88s)]
*  We are now at a moment when the oligarchy is trying to figure out how to form the next [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1157.8400000000001s)]
*  government. There is a tendency either to form what they call a national unity [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1164.64s)]
*  government of the usual suspects, as it were, and bring everybody back into the tent [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1170.1200000000001s)]
*  and then face the international community with that kind of fait accompli. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1176.0s)]
*  Although from the protests or civil society movement and I would say from some of the [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1181.0400000000002s)]
*  diaspora and international community, there's intense pressure to seize this [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1187.48s)]
*  opportunity to form an independent government, a government that is not [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1192.24s)]
*  beholden to the current parties and that it be given extraordinary legislative [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1198.1999999999998s)]
*  powers for a set number of issues for a set amount of time, which has happened [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1203.76s)]
*  several times in Lebanon's past. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1208.36s)]
*  So it can actually get something done. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1210.04s)]
*  So there is a current political opportunity that is being fought over. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1212.32s)]
*  I think more broadly speaking, I think Hezbollah is in a delicate moment in its [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1217.6399999999999s)]
*  sort of strategic alliance trajectory. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1228.6399999999999s)]
*  It has formed a very significant alliance with Michel Aoun and the free patriotic [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1232.32s)]
*  movement back in 2006, 14 years ago. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1240.0s)]
*  And it was hoping that Jibran Basile, his son-in-law, could inherit the movement and [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1244.4s)]
*  the alliance and keep a major, what was the main political party of the Maronite [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1249.8s)]
*  Christian groups, keep them allied with Hezbollah. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1256.76s)]
*  That situation was already very much declining and fraying. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1262.52s)]
*  Jibran Basile does not have anything like the popularity of Michel Aoun once had. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1267.96s)]
*  But I think this blast, which was in the port, which affected a lot of the, to say [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1273.88s)]
*  it crassly, a lot of the Christian neighborhoods of Beirut and the Beirut [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1283.5600000000002s)]
*  suburbs more than West Beirut or Dahia or others, to my reading and many, many [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1287.76s)]
*  others, this is kind of the end of the free patriotic movement being the [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1295.5200000000002s)]
*  dominant movement among the Christians. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1301.64s)]
*  And that is a fundamental crisis for Hezbollah, not today, but in the years [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1304.3200000000002s)]
*  ahead, if the Christian main party, the Christian president can no longer [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1310.4s)]
*  provide political cover. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1317.0s)]
*  I also think fundamentally their partnership with Nabi Berri and the Amal [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1319.0s)]
*  movement, which managed the front office, as it were, of parliament and the Lebanese [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1324.84s)]
*  state, kind of as a projection of Hezbollah into the state, I think Nabi Berri's [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1332.32s)]
*  leadership, A, because of his age, was beginning to be a bit of a question mark. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1340.52s)]
*  But this massive uprising against corruption, which he and many others are [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1345.5600000000002s)]
*  a key part of, and now the blast, in other words, Hezbollah is facing a future [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1349.5600000000002s)]
*  maybe after the next elections, whenever they happen, whenever they happen, that [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1356.2s)]
*  they may no longer have an allied president and they might have to choose [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1360.44s)]
*  somebody else more acceptable to other parties in the country and more acceptable [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1365.88s)]
*  to the international community to head up parliament. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1371.4s)]
*  So I think indeed there is fundamental change. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1374.2s)]
*  I would end on this note with what we call the revolution, the hiraq, there are [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1377.0800000000002s)]
*  many, many different names. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1383.16s)]
*  And I tweeted this earlier today that the revolution has been very, very successful [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1385.16s)]
*  in bringing down governments, but we've not managed to raise up governments. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1391.16s)]
*  In other words, we've not managed to unify, to consolidate the movement, to [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1395.96s)]
*  consolidate the message, to raise up alternative leaders that really can take [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1401.96s)]
*  the place of the corrupt oligarchy. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1408.76s)]
*  Our message has been they have to leave, but we haven't said who will take their [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1411.16s)]
*  place. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1415.64s)]
*  Maha, I want to turn to you. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1416.76s)]
*  We have a lot there to unpack from Paul. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1418.44s)]
*  And just for those who are tuning in who maybe don't know all the names, Michel [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1421.88s)]
*  Aoun is the Christian president of the country, Gibran Basile is his son-in-law [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1425.0s)]
*  and former foreign minister. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1429.88s)]
*  Nabi Hibiri is the Shia speaker of the house and his party is the Amal party. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1431.5600000000002s)]
*  And of course, this sort of sectarian makeup and the continual, never-ending presence [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1438.0400000000002s)]
*  of these same leaders in Lebanon at the helm of the country is one of the main things [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1443.72s)]
*  that protesters on the streets of Beirut are protesting against the corruption [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1450.68s)]
*  establishment, the entrenched interests and the fact that it's the same people who [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1456.52s)]
*  fought the war and made peace and lined their pockets during peacetime. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1461.0800000000002s)]
*  So there are some people who are wondering whether what the protesters want is also a [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1466.68s)]
*  complete change of how roles are divided. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1471.64s)]
*  But let's take a step back at where we are now because I would like for our viewers and [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1475.0s)]
*  listeners to get a better understanding of what happens now technically. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1480.2s)]
*  The cabinet resigned, but Hassan Jabr is obviously still caretaker prime minister. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1484.84s)]
*  So what are the next steps? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1490.52s)]
*  And then, Maha, can you tell us more about this point that Paul just mentioned, which [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1492.36s)]
*  is that the protest movement has been great at bringing down governments, but they have [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1497.24s)]
*  not put forward a leadership. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1502.6s)]
*  And I have my own views about why that is, but I'd love you to tell us. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1504.9199999999998s)]
*  So first, what's going to happen? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1510.84s)]
*  And then what about the protesters? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1512.84s)]
*  The next steps are the president has to call for mandatory consultations with the parliament [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1515.32s)]
*  that will then nominate a prime minister. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1523.08s)]
*  What will likely happen is the president is going to delay these nominations, these [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1529.32s)]
*  consultations, which is what he did last time, until there is a consensus and agreement [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1535.72s)]
*  between the political parties and the international community in this case on the name of the next [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1541.0s)]
*  prime minister. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1547.4s)]
*  There are different versions floating around right now. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1548.6s)]
*  The two scenarios I see ahead is either possibly a transitional government with an independent [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1551.72s)]
*  prime minister, a veteran, someone who is not a novice to the political game, with an [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1559.96s)]
*  independent cabinet, exceptional powers, etc. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1567.88s)]
*  Or the other version, I think this is what Paul was talking about, and that would be [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1571.3200000000002s)]
*  mandated to do the economic reform, negotiate with IMF. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1575.48s)]
*  This would be a cabinet for maybe six months to a year after which it would have prepared [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1579.24s)]
*  the road for early elections, early elections, i.e. in 2021. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1584.2s)]
*  That's as early as they can get. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1588.5200000000002s)]
*  The other road is most likely, the more likely one, well, not more likely, we don't know [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1590.44s)]
*  yet. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1595.4s)]
*  It's a bit too early to tell. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1595.72s)]
*  It's possibly a government with Prime Minister Hariri again, but with, under the conditions [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1597.48s)]
*  that he had, sorry? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1606.76s)]
*  Who resigned in November already. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1609.64s)]
*  Who resigned in November, but it would be under the terms that he had asked for at the [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1611.24s)]
*  time when he was asked to form a new government, which is to come back with, again, a number [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1617.0s)]
*  of a cabinet that is acceptable to the international community, but also acceptable to the Lebanese. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1622.68s)]
*  For the street, I think this would be, I mean, obviously option one, which is an independent [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1629.96s)]
*  cabinet that they have faith in, because we keep forgetting that the massive gap trust [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1635.3200000000002s)]
*  is not just between the international community and the current political elite in Lebanon. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1644.1200000000001s)]
*  What's more critical is the gap trust between the Lebanese people and their political elite. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1649.64s)]
*  When a people goes to the international community and pleads with them not to send any humanitarian [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1655.8000000000002s)]
*  aid to state institutions, that already tells you the state of mind people here are in. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1661.48s)]
*  There's no trust. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1666.8400000000001s)]
*  Their favorite option would be a transitional government that actually prepares the way. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1668.68s)]
*  Some are already asking for also the [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1675.08s)]
*  resignation of the president, but that's unlikely. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1682.1999999999998s)]
*  Going forward in terms of why hasn't the civil society, the protest movement, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1686.12s)]
*  been able to put forward leadership? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1691.0s)]
*  It's an instant movement. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1692.9199999999998s)]
*  We're talking about these things take time. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1694.36s)]
*  People, I mean, especially at the time when [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1696.44s)]
*  networks are being formed, alternative political parties are being formed, let's not forget, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1701.8s)]
*  I mean, there is a build up since 2015 when we already saw demonstrations, people for the [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1707.0s)]
*  first time in a long time, demonstrating en masse without being prompted by their political parties. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1714.8400000000001s)]
*  October 2019, what was remarkable is that for the first time, the demonstrations were not in [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1721.3999999999999s)]
*  Beirut, but were actually spread across the country. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1728.36s)]
*  They were against the leadership of every single political community. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1731.9599999999998s)]
*  I think it takes time. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1736.28s)]
*  It's an instant movement. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1737.56s)]
*  However, already we're seeing new political parties emerge. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1738.9199999999998s)]
*  We're seeing initiatives to put forward coalitions on the basis of a charter, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1742.92s)]
*  on the basis of shared principles, trying to work out a vision for where Lebanon could be [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1752.04s)]
*  and how it could get there. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1760.04s)]
*  So there are different, very different coalitions already being formed. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1761.56s)]
*  I know of at least two to three political parties that have already been formed. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1765.32s)]
*  But all of this is going to take time. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1770.52s)]
*  It doesn't just appear out of nowhere. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1773.0s)]
*  And I think they're already trying to put together, some groups are putting together [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1775.3999999999999s)]
*  their candidates for a potential cabinet, my understanding. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1780.2s)]
*  This all takes time and Lebanon felt like it was already running out of time. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1786.28s)]
*  With so many problems filing on, which is why I want to turn back to you, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1794.04s)]
*  Ishak, I want to talk a little bit more about this huge economic crisis that Lebanon's been [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1797.8s)]
*  going through over the last nine months, economic, financial, currency devaluation, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1804.6s)]
*  rising property levels, rising food prices, and now this, the humanitarian aid that is needed, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1809.8s)]
*  the emergency aid that is needed, more reconstruction, people don't have the money to pay for it. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1819.56s)]
*  How, what is your assessment of how this compounds the current crisis on a macro level? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1824.68s)]
*  We've had eight months of the Hassan Diab government that led nowhere in terms of reforms, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1835.3200000000002s)]
*  in terms of talks with the IMF. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1841.16s)]
*  If there is a vacuum now, if we're going to, if we're looking at months of political vacuum [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1843.88s)]
*  where there's a caretaker prime minister and a caretaker cabinet that are not going to be [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1849.4s)]
*  to take any decisions until the president somehow finds this consensus around a new candidate [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1854.92s)]
*  for prime minister. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1862.3600000000001s)]
*  What are we looking at in terms of what Lebanon is going to face when it comes to [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1863.56s)]
*  further economic hardship and damage? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1868.44s)]
*  No, it's much harder, but let's start appreciating the situation. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1871.56s)]
*  It's been about a year now that the House of Cards collapsed, the Lebanese model collapsed, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1876.44s)]
*  the Lebanese economy were living on capital flows of very large magnitudes going through the banks [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1881.8799999999999s)]
*  and irrigating high standards of life, corruption, and this crony political elite that we've been [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1887.96s)]
*  talking about. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1896.6799999999998s)]
*  Since then, there are no dollars in the economy, there is no credits, the banks have closed, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1898.36s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of firms have closed, they don't have access to import, they don't [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1904.12s)]
*  have access to credit, there's no liquidity in the market, there's hyperinflation, the government [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1908.76s)]
*  is printing money, people can't get their deposits from the banks, there's been an [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1914.68s)]
*  impoverishment of the population, the estimate poverty to be at close to 50% unemployment, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1920.76s)]
*  at least a third, maybe more, and very vigorous actions are needed to reform the system, to [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1927.32s)]
*  absorb the losses, to regain the credit worthiness of the state, the solvency of the [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1935.16s)]
*  banking system, negotiations with the IMF have been going on going nowhere, the Lebanese [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1941.8000000000002s)]
*  are divided between themselves, the bankers have counterattacked with their own plans to get the [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1948.1200000000001s)]
*  assets of the states to bail them out. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1953.24s)]
*  Argentina solved a big problem of that sort in three months, Lebanon hasn't made a dent [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1957.4s)]
*  in the past nine months, and so there's a huge challenge ahead, and this blast has made things [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1964.0400000000002s)]
*  harder in two ways, one kind of a direct financial way, the state is even more broke, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1970.92s)]
*  and a lot of the assets of banks, the little assets they had in the private sector, which are [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1978.8400000000001s)]
*  mostly luxurious real estate property in the front, beach fronts of Beirut are partly destroyed, so [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1984.0400000000002s)]
*  they've lost a lot of money there, and so there's larger losses to be distributed, and that's been [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1991.96s)]
*  the heart of the political difficulty, is it going to be socially fair, like the street wanted, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=1998.04s)]
*  or is it going to be a bailout of the rich, like some of the political elite, and certainly the [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2003.56s)]
*  economic elite wants, so that makes things harder, but probably the most important issue now is the [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2008.8400000000001s)]
*  political vacuum that we have, which will just prolong the time to find a solution, will prolong [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2016.68s)]
*  the misery of people, but also it will make a recovery harder in the sense that assets of all [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2022.92s)]
*  kinds are dissipating, people are leaving, institutions are going bankrupt, all this [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2029.48s)]
*  accumulated organizational capital is disappearing, the state services are getting in very bad shape, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2035.5600000000002s)]
*  the state is in arrears to the health sector in an increasing way, so it's hurting the other sectors [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2044.44s)]
*  even more, and this is the real cause, it makes the recovery much more iffy and uncertain and [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2050.44s)]
*  more difficult and less vigorous when ultimately it will come. If we continue like this, if that [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2059.32s)]
*  vacuum lasts a year or two, Lebanon is increasingly being somalized, if I may say, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2067.56s)]
*  we have hyperinflation, nobody trusts the currency, there's no banking sector, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2075.32s)]
*  everything becomes cash transactions, the state cannot pay employees anymore, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2079.32s)]
*  and basically the population will find itself over time living off international aid, a bit of charity, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2085.88s)]
*  a bit of remittances from their cousins and parents abroad, and it will be another huge [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2093.8s)]
*  weight on the international community, I mean already the UN raised humanitarian aid for Sudan, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2102.2000000000003s)]
*  Somalia, Syria, Yemen, those represent imagine half of the humanitarian money being raised in the [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2108.2000000000003s)]
*  world, these are the largest program of the world, and Lebanon will add to this growing poverty belt [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2116.04s)]
*  in the region if the political class doesn't wake up and manage this. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2121.32s)]
*  Time is really of the essence here and that's something that Lebanese leaders have not quite [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2126.92s)]
*  wanted to understand because perhaps it suits them too much to just hang on to what they have. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2135.7200000000003s)]
*  Paul, I want to turn to you briefly to talk about the regional context and then [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2142.52s)]
*  we're going to move on to some of the questions from the audience, but [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2148.92s)]
*  it is interesting to see how and why an explosion at the Beirut port suddenly becomes [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2153.48s)]
*  an international event in a way, beyond the need for humanitarian aid from everywhere, beyond [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2161.48s)]
*  the British and the French and the UN and the US sending aid, it has become an international [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2169.96s)]
*  discussion. Why is that? And we saw the French president Macron show up, we are hearing from the [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2178.6s)]
*  Iranians that there shouldn't be outside interference in Lebanon, David Hale, the [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2187.08s)]
*  Under Secretary of State of the United States is on his way, why this regional and international [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2192.2s)]
*  action and why is an explosion at the Beirut port suddenly bringing up Hezbollah's role in the [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2198.84s)]
*  country, which you alluded to at the beginning. Tell us a little bit more about that and the [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2207.08s)]
*  regional context in which this is also happening with maximum pressure on Iran and protests in Iraq [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2212.04s)]
*  and so on. Yeah, I mean there are several levels to it, obviously there's the humanitarian as we [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2218.04s)]
*  said, we won't dwell on that. At the second level there is an acute awareness among European [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2223.4s)]
*  countries and the United States that this blast might be the event that tips Lebanon into fully [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2231.0s)]
*  failed state, like full collapse, in which case Lebanon might go into 10-15 years of collapse, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2238.84s)]
*  civil war, terrorist groups and that is such a concern obviously for European countries because [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2246.12s)]
*  of the refugee flow threat, either Syrian refugees who are now in Lebanon and Lebanese refugees who [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2252.76s)]
*  would need to leave for the United States, the risk of the return of major terrorist groups to [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2259.16s)]
*  make Lebanon their base. You know if Lebanon becomes another Somalia or another Lebanon of 1975-1990 [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2265.64s)]
*  that's a huge security concern and geopolitical concern, so there's that. Then over kind of the [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2273.16s)]
*  port itself, there are two kind of geopolitical struggles here. One is as you indicated, related [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2280.92s)]
*  a little bit to Hezbollah, Iran and so on. Although we will never know or we can never know and as [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2287.88s)]
*  a Lebanese state it's not allowed to ask, it was obviously widely assumed or known that Hezbollah [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2294.84s)]
*  certainly operated parts of the port, you know used it for its own means as it also uses the [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2300.6s)]
*  Lebanese airport. When the Lebanese government in 2008 tried to take back control of our national [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2306.92s)]
*  airport, Hezbollah sent its forces onto Beirut and forced the government to back down. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2313.4s)]
*  This explosion has removed everybody from the port including if they were there and likely they [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2320.44s)]
*  were there, Hezbollah as well. So that has certainly drawn the attention of opponents of Hezbollah who [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2327.32s)]
*  say well you know here's an opportunity to maybe keep them out of Beirut port and either force them [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2333.0s)]
*  to use the Syrian ports or some other ports in the south. So there is a sort of an Iran Hezbollah [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2338.84s)]
*  angle to the struggle. In the more global geopolitical struggle, there is the issue of [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2347.48s)]
*  who is going to rebuild the port in the next five to ten years. There is a big concern that obviously [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2356.36s)]
*  China is the main builder of ports, is ready to do so and extend its influence in the Mediterranean. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2363.3199999999997s)]
*  It already has a presence to manage Haifa port in Israel which has been a huge concern [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2372.68s)]
*  certainly for the United, those in the United States. It is also has a deal with Athens over [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2379.3199999999997s)]
*  Peres port and if it were the party to come in and rebuild Beirut port in the next five to ten years [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2384.76s)]
*  that would mean for the 21st century China dominates you know in terms of trade and so on [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2393.7200000000003s)]
*  the eastern Mediterranean. That's a huge geopolitical long-term issue because you don't build ports for a [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2399.48s)]
*  year or two and I know that there's concern to see if kind of a western coalition may be working with [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2405.5600000000004s)]
*  you know Dubai ports or some other avenue could you know talk about rebuilding Beirut port. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2413.4s)]
*  I think in practical terms I don't think the port is going to be rebuilt in any major way. I think [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2422.1200000000003s)]
*  it'll be patched up because I do not think Hezbollah will relinquish the port. So I would think they [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2428.1200000000003s)]
*  would prefer to have it patched up you know little bits and pieces. It already is you know it can [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2435.4s)]
*  accommodate cargo ships you know some it's still functioning but you know China is not going to put [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2440.92s)]
*  five billion dollars in a port. Hezbollah is going to be keeping it at risk nor is anybody else and [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2447.88s)]
*  I'm quite sure Hezbollah is not going to relinquish that. So sadly my conclusion is that the port is [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2454.28s)]
*  going to limp along for many many years until this wider issue is resolved. Obviously the [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2459.88s)]
*  international attention is very very significant and could lead to positive change. Obviously it's [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2467.4s)]
*  significant to help those who were affected and to provide aid but it's also a movement of leverage [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2474.2000000000003s)]
*  of the international community which was already saying before the blast that to the Lebanese [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2479.96s)]
*  leaders you have to implement serious reforms and your macroeconomic policy and your fight [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2485.96s)]
*  against corruption and the electricity sector and many other sectors. If you do that we will engage [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2491.56s)]
*  obviously through the IMF and through the international community. The blast I think has [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2497.08s)]
*  made those international that international attention and those demands not only more intense [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2502.2799999999997s)]
*  and more acute but also I think there's seriousness now in saying look we don't actually trust [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2508.2799999999997s)]
*  your leaders or you the leaders to get this done. We'll give you a chance but in the longer term [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2516.2799999999997s)]
*  I think they're saying we need to have new leadership in the country if we're going to [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2523.48s)]
*  consider putting billions of dollars and I fear that the threat of sanctions, targeted sanctions [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2528.92s)]
*  against some of the top Lebanese leaders are being discussed openly both in the U.S. and in [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2535.96s)]
*  some circles in Paris as well as I hear. I want to go to Maha who wants to make a point and then [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2543.88s)]
*  we're going to go to the questions and if you have not put in your questions yet we have quite [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2548.84s)]
*  a few already in the queue but you can submit your questions in the YouTube chat or by email at [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2553.7200000000003s)]
*  middleeastatceip.org. Maha you wanted to say something. Just to add to one point to what [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2559.4s)]
*  Paul was saying which is the impact of the explosion may be humanitarian but this is a [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2567.6400000000003s)]
*  political crisis par excellence and while what the international community is saying today [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2574.12s)]
*  we will help address the humanitarian repercussions right now which is what the Paris conference was [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2581.48s)]
*  about but the broader political crisis is going to take a bit more time and they recognize this. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2587.08s)]
*  They recognize this as a political legitimacy crisis one that needs to be addressed in one way [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2594.3599999999997s)]
*  or the other and this is where I think the shape the government takes in the next few weeks, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2599.72s)]
*  hopefully not weeks, we should be talking about days given the situation we're in in Lebanon [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2604.68s)]
*  is in today, will tell us which way the wind is blowing. So we're going to go to some of the [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2610.2s)]
*  questions that are filing in and just a reminder to our viewers that we're going to extend the [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2616.6s)]
*  program until just six minutes or seven minutes after the top of the hour depending on where you [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2622.12s)]
*  are. It'll be 6 p.m in Beirut. We're going to go on until 6.06, 6.07 so you can hear the moment of [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2627.64s)]
*  silence anyway you can stand with us and observe a moment of silence for the victims who died [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2635.4s)]
*  in this bomb blaster just in this explosion a week ago today at exactly 6.06 when the huge [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2639.56s)]
*  explosion took place in the port. Church bells will toll in the city, the call to prayer [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2646.6s)]
*  will sound as well and we'll try to bring you that live into this stream. One of the questions [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2651.72s)]
*  that we're getting is from Bilal Saab in DC who is asking I think both Paul and Maha, you could [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2658.36s)]
*  chime into this, how do we balance between going harder against Hezbollah and avoiding a return [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2666.04s)]
*  to arms? That seems to be the biggest challenge. Maha would you like to start? [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2673.72s)]
*  It's a tough balancing act in all honesty. It's a very tough balancing act. Lebanon does not have [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2681.72s)]
*  the capacity to take on Hezbollah, that's for sure, nor Hezbollah's arms. At the same time, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2687.72s)]
*  I mean the backdoor negotiations that are taking place now are very much about that. How do you [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2695.3199999999997s)]
*  how do you move the country out of the quagmire it's in, the political, economic and social [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2703.48s)]
*  that it's in, onto a more stable terrain while you prepare the medium to long-term transition [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2711.2400000000002s)]
*  into a more healthy approach to governance without destabilizing, without a return to arms, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2718.92s)]
*  without a complete breakdown. Is that why President Macron seemed to signal that it was important to [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2726.28s)]
*  have a national unity government, Paul, although that's not what most protesters or any protester [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2732.44s)]
*  wants on the street. But is there a sense that this is a dangerous moment where you do need to [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2738.2000000000003s)]
*  find some common ground to avoid a bigger conflagration and try to find a way forward [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2742.44s)]
*  and by then bringing in the protest movement with new leadership, is that the way forward? [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2747.96s)]
*  Well just I mean a quick comment that according to sort of President Macron's office and whatever [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2754.04s)]
*  the term he used which is understood in Lebanon as bringing in the usual [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2759.48s)]
*  suspects to another government, that's not what he meant when he said that. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2763.64s)]
*  But that's you know let's put that aside. I mean he was very tough when he was in Lebanon [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2768.36s)]
*  against you know the other corrupt politicians, all of them. He said publicly particularly to the [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2773.0s)]
*  protesters there must be political transition, political change. But I'll put that comment aside. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2779.0s)]
*  And accountability. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2783.8s)]
*  Certainly accountability, fight against corruption, all of that. But [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2785.6400000000003s)]
*  the question our friend Bilal asked is a fundamental one and it relates also a little bit. I mean I [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2789.1600000000003s)]
*  talked about the political crisis Hezbollah might be facing in the next couple of years because of [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2795.5600000000004s)]
*  its alliances. I do also think it is absolutely necessary for the Lebanese to the degree they can [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2800.84s)]
*  maybe with help from friends and so on to you know I don't want you to try to use what term [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2809.48s)]
*  negotiate or you know it's very clear that Hezbollah is in Lebanon. It's been you know in their state. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2815.96s)]
*  It does happen to represent a big community and nobody wants any confrontation that would [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2823.56s)]
*  lead to arms. So all of that is definitely the case. But I think in this new period that we're [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2829.8s)]
*  entering into there are new dynamics. The war in Syria is largely over. There is no need for them [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2835.64s)]
*  to be rushing across borders and to be shipping things left right and center. Good for them. You [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2844.52s)]
*  know they propped up you know this horrific regime in Damascus. That the regime is basically you know [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2850.52s)]
*  for better or probably for worse is going to stay there. So this new period of the post-Syrian civil [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2858.52s)]
*  war is one that you know should be put on the table that you don't need to do all of those things. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2864.76s)]
*  The post-blast reality is also one that should be put on the table that you know whether we're [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2870.92s)]
*  not going to argue whether you were in the port or not whatever it is we must agree that you're [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2878.44s)]
*  not going to be in the port as we move forward. We must agree that you should not be in the [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2882.92s)]
*  national airport. If you want an airport I'm sure the Iranians will build you a nice little airport [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2889.0s)]
*  somewhere in Syria or Lebanon and good luck with that. But we cannot have our national port and our [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2894.12s)]
*  national airport controlled by a subgroup which does not accept the Lebanese constitution or the [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2900.2799999999997s)]
*  Lebanese authority and answers to a foreign power. And I think there is wiggle room now for them to [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2907.56s)]
*  accept a more restricted role provided that they don't feel I think directly threatened that [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2914.68s)]
*  anybody's going to come after them. But we have to stand up and say you know that the country is [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2921.88s)]
*  dying. This kind of you know injection of a group allied to a foreign power we get it we cannot [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2928.28s)]
*  remove it but its takeover of the state has killed the state killed the economy and it's nobody it's [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2937.6400000000003s)]
*  in no one's interest. All of this goes back to the Doha agreement kind of which was agreed [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2945.0s)]
*  in 2008 and I think we have to walk completely walk back. There's got to be a new deal and that's [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2949.96s)]
*  kind of what President Macron was partly hinting at. He can help because he has contacts with the [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2956.44s)]
*  Iranians because at the end of the day the Iranians will be calling the shots unfortunately as relates [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2961.48s)]
*  to what Hezbollah can or cannot do. It must be done it's complicated it's delicate nobody wants [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2967.32s)]
*  a confrontation. We have focused quite a bit on Hezbollah but obviously there's a whole [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2973.4s)]
*  slew of leaders in this country who have been around for a long time. Hezbollah did not invent [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2980.28s)]
*  the corruption. They're not the only ones they're part of the establishment now that's why they're [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2985.48s)]
*  also facing the protests and there's a very good question from Paul Edel who's asking how can Lebanon [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2990.36s)]
*  provide a graceful exit for the old leaders? As Haq I don't know whether you want to take that in [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=2998.68s)]
*  is there you know a compensation that can be offered that will make up for what they think [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3007.7999999999997s)]
*  they might lose if they lose power and perhaps Maha you want to chime in there too? [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3013.48s)]
*  Well I think Paul it's a it's a good question there is a danger of the exit being too graceful [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3019.48s)]
*  like after the end of the civil war where they would demand immunity for crime committed in the [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3024.6s)]
*  past. I bet you if we had such a law the crisis would be resolved faster but there would be a [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3029.64s)]
*  sense of deep sense of unfairness really among the population and so you know some of the [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3037.48s)]
*  most egregious crimes would have financial crimes you know would have to be punished [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3045.16s)]
*  but I think leaders have to think of their kids I mean if they burn the country there's nothing [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3050.44s)]
*  left for them this is a small country people know each other I think there has to be more [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3055.64s)]
*  attempt for inclusive solutions they have communities around them they must realize that [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3061.88s)]
*  they cannot live on patronage and clientelism anymore because oil is not gushing into the [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3068.12s)]
*  country anymore you know collectively we they the communities they have to find better ways of [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3073.48s)]
*  growing this country in the future and and they know they have assets you know they there are [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3080.68s)]
*  skills the entrepreneurship is beautiful nature there's diaspora there is another way that would [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3085.96s)]
*  benefit everyone including Hezbollah supporters by the way would be much better off in a few years [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3092.2s)]
*  after a five-year recovery like Greece for example so it's a better future for everyone [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3098.36s)]
*  and you know the the oligarchs themselves are very old I think they would not see the recovery [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3105.88s)]
*  themselves but hopefully their kids would benefit from it because it goes to the crux of the of the [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3111.0800000000004s)]
*  discussion uh maha how do you encourage some of them to leave the focus has been on the prime [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3117.0s)]
*  minister but there is a president who's been around in one form or another for for a long time [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3124.2s)]
*  a lot of people blame him for what has happened and what's happened in the past under his watch [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3130.4399999999996s)]
*  and in Beirut you have a speaker of the house who's been around forever I mean this system is [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3135.48s)]
*  entrenched and you know the old has not died the birth is not the new is not born born yet how do [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3140.3599999999997s)]
*  you see this um you know unfold how will this question from simon filipini how do you replace [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3146.92s)]
*  the political um leaders and how do you go towards this urgently needed um transformative change is [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3154.84s)]
*  there a danger that any new leader is already we don't want to sound too negative but that any new [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3163.88s)]
*  leadership is already co-opted at the start by by the old outgoing leaders [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3169.88s)]
*  uh not necessarily as I said there is there is already I mean we've seen some remarkable [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3176.92s)]
*  young leaders emerge over the past few months and I think we will see more and more this country [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3183.5600000000004s)]
*  is not short on talent at every single level so when it comes to the old existing leadership [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3189.32s)]
*  it's true we focused on Hezbollah we haven't talked enough for example about the FNP the [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3197.0s)]
*  reason why people blame the president and is because they've acted as a fig leaf to incredible [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3201.48s)]
*  corruption not just uh you know in support of of of Hezbollah and others but to incredible [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3209.8s)]
*  corruption by his own very family including his son-in-law um so that's where a lot of this anger [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3217.16s)]
*  comes from now in terms of how to provide a graceful exit I think it's going to be a [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3226.12s)]
*  carrot and a stick approach I think with some some might be sanctioned as paul said there's [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3232.6s)]
*  already discussions in both American and US and French circles about the potential of sanctions [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3239.56s)]
*  against some of the key figures that have been really are not only economically corrupt but have [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3245.24s)]
*  really played a very obstructive role in Lebanon's politics encouraging some to be [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3249.72s)]
*  to return some of the money that's a much longer legal process this has to go by the law [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3257.8799999999997s)]
*  but also voting if we're going to have a parliamentary election in one one year this [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3265.64s)]
*  is a democratic country and we've got to hold on to our democratic institutions not hold on to them [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3271.9599999999996s)]
*  but deepen these democratic practices so voting them out is the other way to go and I think with [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3278.84s)]
*  the current mood that the country's in that there could be openings there maybe not wholesale voting [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3286.28s)]
*  out we also need to recognize this will take time again these processes transitions don't happen [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3292.1200000000003s)]
*  overnight otherwise you will have a reaction and spoilers talk about elections and there have been [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3298.6000000000004s)]
*  some calls for early elections not everybody thinks that's the way forward because there is [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3306.76s)]
*  a problematic electoral law in place paul I know you need to leave us at the very top of the hour [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3312.0400000000004s)]
*  so I'm going to give you the opportunity to answer that question before before you go what is the [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3318.2000000000003s)]
*  sequence of events to produce this new leadership I mean you can have a new transitional government [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3324.84s)]
*  but then how do you hold elections does this new transitional government have [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3332.52s)]
*  executive powers and legislative powers to produce a new electoral law that could then [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3336.2799999999997s)]
*  produce real change from the bottom up with elections that really represent the will of the [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3341.48s)]
*  yeah first of all I mean there is a need as we've said already and we need to keep focused on that [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3349.16s)]
*  that a new government be put in place with new leaders like not wait till the elections for [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3355.9599999999996s)]
*  major change to happen this is a moment of great leverage for the people of the country for the [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3361.16s)]
*  international community so we need to keep focused on that I think when the outgoing prime minister [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3366.2799999999997s)]
*  has sent yet suggested early elections in a way he was trying to change the subject saying you [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3371.8799999999997s)]
*  know okay let's talk about elections now which means the government would stay in place be caretaker [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3377.7999999999997s)]
*  let's argue about the election law and that could take forever elections are absolutely necessary [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3383.16s)]
*  as maha said I mean we must not forget all of these leaders were elected into office a couple [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3391.3999999999996s)]
*  of years ago by the people they weren't forced to the problem with the elections is not the election [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3397.24s)]
*  law we've had many many different elections law including the current one which is a very [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3404.3599999999997s)]
*  flexible law which I would allow a lot of new groups to enter into parliament the problem is [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3410.04s)]
*  that the traditional parties and the traditional oligarchs are the only ones so far who have you [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3417.3199999999997s)]
*  know who have experience and major electoral machines village by village by conduct elections [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3424.8399999999997s)]
*  are local affairs they don't you don't win an election by protesting in downtown beirut you [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3432.8399999999997s)]
*  have to build it from the ground up and as maha said obviously this takes time and the civil [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3438.04s)]
*  society movement you know is largely an urban you know young event and organizing protests has very [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3442.92s)]
*  little to do with building an electoral base and you know we've had all of us are very involved [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3451.16s)]
*  with a lot of the groups in lebanon and we are working with them to begin building preparations [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3457.64s)]
*  for the elections and the movement needs to again consolidate you can have you know 90 different [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3464.84s)]
*  groups trying to contest elections they will all lose it has to become in the majority one major [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3470.36s)]
*  opposition group contesting in a big way so that can have momentum it needs to organize village by [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3477.24s)]
*  village re-qadha by qadha you know lebanon is cut up into qadas or districts if it is so organized [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3483.56s)]
*  it can win an election no matter what the election law is and i've i've i've written you know i've [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3491.24s)]

*  organized another law you can win big if you're organized and there is no law that will make you [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3502.12s)]
*  win if you're not organized there's no law which says okay here's the law you have no voter is [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3508.6s)]
*  really organized but you're going to win that that doesn't exist plus it would obviously be [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3513.56s)]
*  not democratic so the lesson is organize organize organize i do apologize i need to leave at the top [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3518.68s)]

*  this moment in labanon there's a lot of people who are leaving the country but i also know some [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3573.64s)]
*  people are coming back and i know that the diaspora is very in tune and in touch with what's going on [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3579.08s)]
*  you've spoken at the beginning of the conversation about a moment of hope so tell us a little bit [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3585.16s)]
*  more about what you're you're hearing around you about how the diaspora sees this yeah i'm [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3590.2s)]

*  from all over the world that you've never heard of and god knows by which network this this [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3601.88s)]
*  information circulates it's a global network it's amazing they are you know many times more [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3607.48s)]
*  people of lebanese culture that say in the world than than in lebanon and it makes lebanon [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3613.7200000000003s)]
*  global lebanon something something else really and uh is not it is large it has been in the past [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3620.84s)]
*  largely about remittances this is what we focused on banking sector people putting money to get high [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3628.28s)]
*  interest but but it could be much more than that it's a culture there are consumption patterns [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3633.96s)]
*  there are movements in and out into this network to grow and back to bring skills to get married [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3642.1200000000003s)]
*  to go to hospitals to send kids to universities we need to think of the future of the economy as [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3649.48s)]
*  as part of a global network really with with lebanon at the heart but with a very important [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3656.2000000000003s)]
*  circulation with benefits going both ways and also fit the electoral and and many other policies [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3661.8s)]
*  in that direction it would make it a unique economy like greece or other economies have been in the past [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3669.5600000000004s)]
*  uh i saw this really wonderful tweet a few days ago we often talk about [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3676.2s)]
*  beirut as the paris of the middle east and this person said you know beirut is not the paris of [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3685.48s)]
*  the middle east it's the beirut of the world and there really is something very special [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3690.2s)]
*  about beirut of course we're biased it's our home city it's our country [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3695.64s)]
*  but maha i want to go back to something that you wrote in your piece about [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3699.72s)]
*  lebanon having multiple futures ahead of it that it is open to multiple [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3703.88s)]
*  futures and i was wondering whether you could expand a little bit on that [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3710.6800000000003s)]
*  i will but if i can just build one word on what is ha was saying which is what is remarkable [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3717.2400000000002s)]
*  and i think it's a it's a treasure growth that we really haven't focused on is the extent to [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3723.88s)]
*  which the diaspora is invested in lebanon these are people some of whom have lived [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3729.0s)]
*  the better part of their lives outside of the country and yet they're keen on seeing change [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3734.68s)]
*  both political it's not just about sending money home anymore it's about actually seeing a country [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3740.44s)]
*  that's capable of surviving and having multiple futures beirut is a cosmopolitan city it's a city [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3746.44s)]
*  that has sat at the crossroads of culture since it came about it's a port city on the mediterranean [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3753.32s)]
*  that's always been open to the rest of the world so the the idea of it having multiple futures is [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3759.88s)]
*  that at this point it's facing the most lebanon not just beirut is facing the most critical crisis [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3767.0s)]
*  in its contemporary history the country is facing as we've already discussed a cause a [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3774.2000000000003s)]
*  a political crisis an economic and financial crisis a health crisis we haven't talked about [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3781.56s)]
*  the effect of the pandemic and the lockdown measures associated with the pandemic and now [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3786.7599999999998s)]
*  this explosion a security crisis so today we are at a crossroad again with the support of the and [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3791.72s)]
*  that's why i'm kind of really focusing on where these the options of the next government and what [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3800.52s)]
*  happens next if the road taken which is which has not been taken in a very long time [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3806.52s)]
*  is the one where there is a transitional government with the intent of moving the country [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3814.04s)]
*  gradually towards a more viable system that has that rethink its economic model [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3820.52s)]
*  the model that lebanon the economic model that lebanon was built on was the merchant republic i.e [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3828.6s)]
*  country that relies on services that's gone we knew we need a new economic model the political [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3833.64s)]
*  model has been one of power sharing between different sectarian groups that is not completely [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3839.7999999999997s)]
*  gone but we have to work our way out of it i want to pause there because there's a question from [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3847.0s)]
*  helene arcovan asking about real substantial political reform is it possible to move away [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3852.2s)]
*  from the confessional system i mean now we're really opening the pandora's box right [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3858.52s)]
*  says that it says that actually has a road map for that yeah the idea is there is a road map [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3864.44s)]
*  for that we're supposed to we were supposed to vote sorry one person one vote system not even [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3873.16s)]
*  the one person one vote the idea is that you all you you move towards a non-confessional parliament [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3879.72s)]
*  where each member of parliament represents the nation doesn't just represent their particular [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3886.36s)]
*  sect and then you you have a senate of religious leaders where any strategic decision that has to [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3891.88s)]
*  do with lebanon would take that into account and the idea of the senate is to make sure that [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3901.48s)]
*  lebanon's unique blend of 18 different sectarian communities in a state that has no religious [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3908.04s)]
*  color and this is what's very interesting about lebanon it's a state where which has an equal [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3915.16s)]
*  distance from all of the different sectarian groups that that exists in the country so the senate is [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C58208v_48&t=3921.24s)]
