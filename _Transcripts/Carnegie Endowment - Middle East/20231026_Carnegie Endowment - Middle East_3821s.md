# The Israel-Hamas Conflict: What Comes After?
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [October 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo)
*  Welcome to everyone here in Washington. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm the president of the Carnegie endowment for international peace. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=29.92s)]
*  Over a century ago, Andrew Carnegie created this institution with the aim of using knowledge, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=36.24s)]
*  ideas and relationships to help eliminate the scourge of war and improve human prosperity [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=41.44s)]
*  through international cooperation. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=46.260000000000005s)]
*  That's the mission we've remained focused on to this day. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=48.72s)]
*  Now we're gathering late in the year, in a year that shows how far the world is from [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=51.86s)]
*  that very goal. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  In recent months alone, we've seen horrifying violence and armed conflict around the world [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=57.559999999999995s)]
*  from Azerbaijan's lightning offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh to Russia's continued war in Ukraine, conflict [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  in Sudan, Akun Nisheir continued fighting in Ethiopia. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=68.16s)]
*  This pattern of violence continued three weeks ago, tragically, as Hamas fighters carried [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=72.38s)]
*  out a brutal terrorist attack in Israel that took the lives of more than 1400 people, overwhelmingly [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=77.92s)]
*  civilians and kidnapped more than 200 people, according to official reports. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=83.52s)]
*  In the days since that attack, the Israeli military has conducted thousands of airstrikes [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=88.08s)]
*  against Hamas targets in Gaza, cut off electricity and water supplies and is reportedly preparing [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=91.8s)]
*  for a ground invasion. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=96.92s)]
*  These events are already taking an enormous toll on civilians. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=98.72s)]
*  Authorities in Gaza report that the fighting since October 7 has killed more than 5000 [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=102.96s)]
*  people. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=107.32s)]
*  The UN estimates that there are 1.4 million people internally displaced in Gaza. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=108.32s)]
*  And although the UN estimates civilians in Gaza need approximately 20 times as much aid [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=112.84s)]
*  as they are currently receiving, negotiations over so-called humanitarian passes to allow [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  aid are ongoing. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  Crisis threatens to escalate with immediate implications for countries across the region, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=124.72s)]
*  from Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon to Iran and Saudi Arabia. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  So altogether, we're at a painful chapter for the world and one that looks like it may [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=133.52s)]
*  get worse before it gets better. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=138.32s)]
*  That said, the world has shown time and again that a combination of nuanced analysis, principled [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=140.74s)]
*  leadership can help mitigate the worst of human violence and put the world on a path [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=146.5s)]
*  towards peace. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=151.06s)]
*  And at some level, we have no choice but to make the most of these peaceful tools in a [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=152.54000000000002s)]
*  world that needs both moral clarity and nuance. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=156.66s)]
*  That's the vision for global cooperation the Carnegie Endowment exists to support. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=160.78s)]
*  We hope today's conversation, which will cover both the complex immediate dynamics and longer [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=165.02s)]
*  term potential for resolution and prospects for peace, will be a contribution to that [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=169.78s)]
*  goal. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=175.14s)]

*  Thank you, Carnegie, for hosting this timely panel. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=270.44s)]

*  event. We meet at a very dark moment in the Middle East. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=279.12s)]
*  More than 7000 Palestinians, 1400 Israelis have been killed in the last 20 days. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=283.8s)]
*  We are seeing clashes on the Lebanon border in a manner we haven't seen since the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=291.24s)]
*  1990s. Israel struck Syria four times in that same period. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=296.52000000000004s)]
*  Meanwhile, a humanitarian catastrophe is already unfolding in Gaza. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=303.2s)]
*  Fuel, clean water shortages, hospitals and shelters are over capacity. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=308.64000000000004s)]
*  How did we get here? What is next? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=316.28000000000003s)]

*  With me, as Tino mentioned, an excellent group of thinkers and regional voices who [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=322.88000000000005s)]
*  have experienced firsthand the brunt of this conflict. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=334.12s)]
*  Marwan Moasher, you all know him, vice president of studies at Carnegie and former [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=338.72s)]
*  Jordanian foreign minister, a veteran diplomat on Middle East issues. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=345.72s)]
*  Dr. Barghouti, a physician, a Jerusalemite who serves a general secretary for [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=352.4s)]
*  Al Mubadara, the Palestinian initiative. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=359.35999999999996s)]
*  It's a third way movement. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=362.67999999999995s)]
*  That's not Hamas or the Palestinian Authority. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=364.76s)]
*  Amir Hamzawi, a friend, a senior fellow at Carnegie, where he has written extensively [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=368.52s)]
*  on vulnerable societies and authoritarianism in the region. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=374.44s)]
*  Celine Taboul, an executive director of the Economic Cooperation Foundation and working [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=378.55999999999995s)]
*  on policy recommendations for the day after in Gaza. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=384.4s)]
*  So without further ado, Dr. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=389.71999999999997s)]
*  Barghouti, I want to start with you. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=392.56s)]
*  How did we get here? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=396.23999999999995s)]
*  And you're in Ramallah right now. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=398.0s)]
*  How is the situation on the ground? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=400.32s)]
*  Thank you. I just need to ask you how many minutes you want me to speak for? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=404.59999999999997s)]
*  Since we only have an hour and it's five of us, so would appreciate if you can keep it short. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=411.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, well, just tell me 10 minutes. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=419.40000000000003s)]
*  Two minutes would be good. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=421.44s)]
*  Two minutes? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=424.12s)]
*  Yes. And then we can follow up. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=425.12s)]
*  Well, two minutes is too short. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=429.92s)]
*  Anyhow, three minutes. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=431.36s)]
*  Even BBC gives me more. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=433.88s)]
*  It's OK. I would like to say, OK, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=435.88s)]
*  you raised many questions, but very shortly. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=440.24s)]
*  I think what we witnessed today, this disaster is a result of two processes, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=444.40000000000003s)]
*  of two things that didn't take place. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=448.76s)]
*  The first one is and for that, I hold the American administration responsible [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=451.8s)]
*  that during the last three years, the Palestinians have been demanding and requesting [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=456.96000000000004s)]
*  and begging for an initiation of a peace process, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=462.32s)]
*  which Netanyahu has blocked since 2014 completely. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=466.91999999999996s)]
*  And this American administration, including the president and his state secretary, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=471.2s)]
*  kept saying that is no time is not appropriate because, of course, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=475.91999999999996s)]
*  Israelis didn't want that. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=480.88s)]
*  So all these three years, we lost any opportunity. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=483.2s)]
*  Second, the biggest problem was or the biggest mistake was not to allow Palestinians [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=486.55999999999995s)]
*  to have their democratic free elections in 2021. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=491.4s)]
*  All the polls have shown that had we have these elections, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=494.88s)]
*  we would be in a completely different situation today [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=499.2s)]
*  because neither Hamas nor Fatah would have the chance to would have had [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=502.72s)]
*  the chance to get the majority, an absolute majority. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=507.24s)]
*  We would have ended with a pluralistic system. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=510.56s)]
*  Probably this would have ended the situation of one party rule, both in Gaza and West Bank. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=513.88s)]
*  But that was not allowed. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=519.4s)]
*  Israel was adamantly against Palestinian elections. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=522.1600000000001s)]
*  The PA canceled the elections on wrong grounds. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=525.72s)]
*  And the United States was also against having free democratic elections, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=528.36s)]
*  spreading the fear that Hamas would win, which is not true. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=532.48s)]
*  Anyhow, the outcome is what we see today. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=537.12s)]
*  But of course, none of us would be would be supportive of or accepting any attack [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=540.08s)]
*  on any civilian, including the Israeli or Palestinians. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=546.9200000000001s)]
*  But I have to say that what we see today in the world media and everywhere [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=550.64s)]
*  is an act of dehumanization of Palestinian people, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=555.4s)]
*  allowing the allowing Israel to commit three war crimes, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=559.48s)]
*  which are taking place today. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=566.0s)]
*  Collective punishment. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=568.24s)]
*  And we can talk later about the results of that. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=569.8s)]
*  Ethnic cleansing, which is, in my opinion, the Israeli real plan, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=573.04s)]
*  which is to try to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza into Egypt. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=577.0799999999999s)]
*  And finally, an act of genocide, which has taken already, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=580.92s)]
*  in addition to the 1400 Israelis killed in Hamas strike, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=584.0799999999999s)]
*  we have now 7000 Palestinians killed, including no less than 2900 children. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=588.88s)]
*  Every five minutes, a Palestinian is killed. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=595.0799999999999s)]
*  Every 10 to 15 minutes, another Palestinian child dies. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=597.76s)]
*  This is the situation we are in. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=603.16s)]
*  And the West Bank also witnesses a lot of troubles. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=604.96s)]
*  So far, Israelis have killed the Israeli army and settlers have killed [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=609.24s)]
*  104 Palestinians in the West Bank during the last 20 days. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=613.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=618.88s)]
*  Thank you for that. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=621.24s)]
*  You hinted at Palestinian Palestinian authority, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=622.32s)]
*  not being one party that didn't allow elections as well. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=626.48s)]
*  Is it Palestinian reflecting back? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=631.08s)]
*  You know how we got here. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=634.04s)]
*  I get the point on US failures, not resuming the peace negotiations. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=634.9599999999999s)]
*  What are major Palestinian failures from your vantage point that got us here? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=642.36s)]
*  The first failure is that we did not have elections since 2006, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=649.64s)]
*  and that is the biggest failure. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=654.04s)]
*  The second biggest failure is that the Palestinian authority [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=656.68s)]
*  obstructed any real efforts towards unification of Palestinians [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=659.76s)]
*  and to have immunity. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=664.16s)]
*  And the third failure is what we see today. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=667.28s)]
*  This passiveness of the Palestinian authority, as if they are sort of [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=670.36s)]
*  not part of what's going on. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=677.2s)]
*  I mean, this is very dangerous and it aggravates people [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=678.92s)]
*  and it makes them very angry. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=683.6s)]
*  But of course, of course, one of the greatest failures here [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=686.36s)]
*  is that even when Palestinians tend to nonviolence, as I did, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=692.04s)]
*  and you know, I led many, many nonviolent actions, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=696.84s)]
*  we were always encountered with severe violence from the Israeli side, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=700.72s)]
*  even the peace marches in Gaza. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=704.5600000000001s)]
*  You remember what happened. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=707.48s)]
*  So there is a big, big, big blame here on the Israeli side, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=709.48s)]
*  which consistently and continuously encountered Palestinians [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=714.72s)]
*  only with violence and with the continuation of occupation. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=719.4s)]
*  What strikes me so much is the act of witch hunting [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=722.44s)]
*  that is happening now against Guterres, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=726.76s)]
*  the Secretary General of the United Nations, only because he dared [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=729.6s)]
*  after condemning the attack on Israelis, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=733.4s)]
*  he dared to remind everybody with the fact that this did not come from a vacuum [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=736.44s)]
*  and that we have an occupation that is 56 years old [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=741.56s)]
*  and ethnic cleansing that is 75 years old [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=744.8399999999999s)]
*  and that there is a context of what's happening. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=748.64s)]
*  And what shocked me more is the statement of the Foreign Minister of Israel, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=753.24s)]
*  Mr. Cohen, who said in the United Nations, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=759.1999999999999s)]
*  openly and clearly that from now on, there is no place for balanced positions. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=763.52s)]
*  Either you are with us or you are our enemy. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=768.92s)]
*  That is very strange. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=772.16s)]
*  As strange as it is, and by the way, I have to mention that, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=774.12s)]
*  was the map that Mr. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=778.88s)]
*  Netanyahu carried in the United Nations in front of everybody a few weeks ago, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=780.64s)]
*  which showed the map of Israel, including annexing the West Bank [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=786.12s)]
*  and annexing Gaza, in addition to the Golan Heights. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=790.84s)]
*  The only government that criticized that act was the German government at the time. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=795.16s)]
*  And that passed. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=800.32s)]
*  But that makes it clear to people now here that the real [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=802.08s)]
*  the real the real goal of Mr. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=805.84s)]
*  Netanyahu is really to ethnically cleanse Gaza. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=808.32s)]
*  And I can talk later about that in details and annex it to Israel. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=811.52s)]
*  Thank you. I think you're referencing the during the General Assembly meetings, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=816.0s)]
*  the map that Netanyahu showed of the what he called the new Middle East. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=820.08s)]
*  Dr. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=826.5200000000001s)]
*  Mouashir, I want to ask you, we're at a different regional moment. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=826.84s)]
*  The Middle East is boiling. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=832.44s)]
*  Jordan has been seeing almost daily protests in solidarity with the Palestinians. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=835.24s)]
*  We've mentioned the border clashes with Lebanon. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=841.2800000000001s)]
*  Egypt is extremely worried. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=847.2800000000001s)]
*  Where do you see this this regional upheaval? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=848.84s)]
*  Are you how worried are you of this escalating to a regional war [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=852.6s)]
*  in a way we haven't seen since 1973? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=858.44s)]
*  I want to refer to Jordan and Egypt. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=864.0s)]
*  Maybe Amr will also address the Egyptian issue. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=866.9200000000001s)]
*  Real worry. First of all, you know what Dr. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=870.08s)]
*  Mustafa alluded to is the crux of the problem. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=873.88s)]
*  We have an occupation and there have been many attempts in the past [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=877.36s)]
*  to ignore the occupation and to try to come up with ad hoc solutions here and there. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=881.76s)]
*  It is very clear from what has been going on that this is not going to work, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=887.24s)]
*  that the cycle of violence between the two sides is going to remain until we, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=892.72s)]
*  you know, we meaning the international community understands [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=898.36s)]
*  that we have to address the occupation issue. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=902.24s)]
*  And any political process that might come out of this, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=905.9200000000001s)]
*  and I'm still skeptical in the short term of any political process that might come out, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=910.1600000000001s)]
*  but any political process that attempts once again to address ad hoc issues, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=916.2800000000001s)]
*  to look at small problems here and there and ease the situation [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=922.12s)]
*  in a very limited way is not going to succeed unless we address the issue [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=928.2s)]
*  of the occupation seriously and, you know, towards ending that occupation. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=933.2s)]
*  I'm afraid that the cycle of violence is going to go on. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=938.32s)]
*  Jordan today is very worried. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=942.2800000000001s)]
*  I'll let Amr speak about Egypt. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=943.9200000000001s)]
*  I think he has a similar view. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=946.9200000000001s)]
*  It's very worried that if the current Israeli coalition does not want to end [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=949.1600000000001s)]
*  the occupation and does not want to establish a Palestinian state, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=953.88s)]
*  and they clearly don't because they have said that many times. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=958.44s)]
*  And if on top of that, the Israelis don't want a Palestinian majority in areas [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=962.2399999999999s)]
*  under Israel's control, and today the Palestinians constitute a majority, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=967.1999999999999s)]
*  7.4 million to 7.2 million, then the only alternative Israel has [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=972.4799999999999s)]
*  is to affect a mass transfer from Gaza to Egypt. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=979.4s)]
*  And if the situation extends to the West Bank, and it is already extending [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=983.7199999999999s)]
*  to the West Bank, as Dr. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=988.0s)]
*  Mustafa has alluded, from the West Bank to Jordan, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=990.4000000000001s)]
*  we used to think that this is a thing of the past. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=995.12s)]
*  But frankly, after Ukraine and after Syria, you know, mass transfer of people [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=998.6800000000001s)]
*  is not something imaginary. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1004.12s)]
*  It has happened. It has happened more than once. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1007.2800000000001s)]
*  And the logical conclusion [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1010.6s)]
*  that countries like Jordan and Egypt have is that if Israel does not want [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1015.7199999999999s)]
*  the first two options, then the only third option is to try to get rid [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1021.28s)]
*  of as many Palestinians as possible. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1027.04s)]
*  That is the real concern. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1029.6399999999999s)]
*  You know, the Israeli argument, and I'd like you to weigh in on that, is, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1032.8s)]
*  look, we've left Gaza in 2005. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1038.2s)]
*  We're not occupying power on the ground in Gaza. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1042.16s)]
*  We've left South Lebanon in 2000, and we still see instability. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1046.88s)]
*  I'm sure you know the situation in Gaza. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1055.1200000000001s)]
*  So how do you how would you respond? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1056.76s)]
*  Israel has never left Gaza. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1058.64s)]
*  Israel has locked up Gaza in a big prison since they left in 2005. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1061.0800000000002s)]
*  Israel has not allowed the Palestinians from Gaza to have their own seaport, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1066.16s)]
*  to have their own airport, to have their own economy. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1071.16s)]
*  That's not leaving Gaza. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1074.3600000000001s)]
*  That's locking up Gaza in a big prison. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1076.44s)]
*  Not just that, but without also giving a political horizon [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1080.5600000000002s)]
*  to end the occupation, the last peace process, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1085.6000000000001s)]
*  the last negotiations that took place between Palestinians and Israelis [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1089.44s)]
*  were in 2014, nine years ago. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1093.48s)]
*  So you keep people locked up in a big prison for 18 years [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1097.28s)]
*  without a political horizon for nine years. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1102.52s)]
*  I don't think we should have been surprised by what has happened. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1105.8s)]
*  Saleen, I want to go to you and ask you. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1110.76s)]
*  You've been monitoring the situation in Gaza for the last 12 years. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1114.0800000000002s)]
*  Were you surprised by the October 7 events? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1119.32s)]
*  I think that there was always an assumption that Hamas [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1127.96s)]
*  very much wanted, it was seeking ways to capture soldiers and civilians. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1133.0800000000002s)]
*  It was always a working assumption [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1139.8400000000001s)]
*  that they were doing everything possible to achieve that objective. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1144.04s)]
*  In that sense, I would say it's not a surprise. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1151.32s)]
*  It is a surprise because there was a working assumption [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1154.4s)]
*  that you can domesticate Hamas [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1157.8400000000001s)]
*  and that it could work in a transactional way [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1162.2s)]
*  with receiving cut-off funds [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1166.76s)]
*  and so bringing back reducing tension in Gaza as a result. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1169.96s)]
*  And that there could be this kind of quid pro quo with the organisation. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1175.2s)]
*  And in that sense, I think that the surprise comes from those [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1182.3600000000001s)]
*  that dismissed the fundamental ideology of the organisation [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1186.8000000000002s)]
*  that did not want to only secure their control over Gaza, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1194.16s)]
*  but primarily to achieve an ideological objective, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1202.2s)]
*  even at the risk of compromising the possibility of the organisation [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1212.2s)]
*  to maintain control over Gaza. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1221.64s)]
*  And that was, I think, a profound mistake in the assessments [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1225.6000000000001s)]
*  that were made by the intelligence and the political echelon in Israel. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1229.6s)]
*  I tend to kind of avoid putting the blame on Israeli intelligence [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1236.8s)]
*  because I think that it kind of cleaned our political leadership [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1242.8799999999999s)]
*  from the responsibility of the failed policy that it has advanced [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1247.24s)]
*  when it comes to Gaza, but also to the West Bank. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1252.8799999999999s)]
*  Thank you. And I know you're in Tel Aviv right now. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1259.6s)]
*  How is the situation on the ground? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1262.56s)]
*  The rocket barrages have not stopped despite heavy airstrikes inside Gaza. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1266.8s)]
*  How is it if you can give us a sense of how it's over there? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1272.72s)]
*  So first I'm in Tel Aviv, so I certainly do not want to compare [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1278.72s)]
*  what I'm suffering with, what the communities, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1283.08s)]
*  the Israeli communities living at the border of Gaza have been entering. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1289.56s)]
*  It is impossible to compare. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1294.4399999999998s)]
*  But I mean, there is sirens all the time, in a regular basis. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1298.6799999999998s)]
*  People don't go to work, children don't go to school. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1308.84s)]
*  And again, I don't want to go into a comparison between [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1312.84s)]
*  what the civilian population in Gaza is enduring. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1317.8s)]
*  I don't think that we should kind of compete whenever with the level of suffering. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1321.48s)]
*  I regret any civilian suffering in the tragedy that is taking place here. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1329.32s)]
*  But I think that there is a serious trauma in Israel [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1336.04s)]
*  when we saw a very deep one when we saw the picture of Hamas militants [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1341.4s)]
*  entering door to door in these Israeli communities, 15 communities surrounding Gaza, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1350.68s)]
*  and brutally murdering people living there without discrimination. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1358.8400000000001s)]
*  So I think there is a collective trauma here, but I feel privileged [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1366.92s)]
*  to live in a place where I don't directly and personally suffer from this. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1374.68s)]
*  Not at least to the same scope, I would say. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1381.16s)]
*  Thank you. Amr, I want to turn to you. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1384.28s)]
*  Egypt is at the center of this, whether through [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1387.56s)]
*  control of the Rafah crossing, the only passage out of Gaza at the moment, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1394.6000000000001s)]
*  whether in mediating the release of 200 hostages that are still with Hamas [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1399.64s)]
*  and the fears of displacement and transfer that Marwan spoke about. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1407.64s)]
*  How do you see this? How alarming is this to Cairo? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1415.4s)]
*  This is also coming on the heels of a December election. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1420.28s)]
*  So if you can give us the assessment where you see Egypt in all of this. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1424.6799999999998s)]
*  Sure. Thank you so much, Joyce. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1430.6799999999998s)]
*  It's definitely an alarming situation that has been unfolding in the last three weeks, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1433.08s)]
*  almost in Gaza at different levels, which I would like to outline very briefly. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1438.4399999999998s)]
*  The first level is the humanitarian crisis. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1445.1599999999999s)]
*  The humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza for almost two and a half million [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1448.12s)]
*  citizens of Gaza, which had been facing the Israeli collective punishment, a war crime [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1454.84s)]
*  that Israel has started to commit right after the attacks of October 7, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1461.6399999999999s)]
*  which I personally condemned in many different ways, but also Arab governments did condemn, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1466.76s)]
*  and I believe most Arab civil society organizations have condemned as well. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1473.7199999999998s)]
*  Clearly, we have a clear public opinion in the region condemning the killing of civilians. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1478.44s)]
*  But the two and a half million Palestinians living in Gaza have been facing Israeli collective [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1484.2s)]
*  punishment starting October 8. It has led to a humanitarian crisis. In response to it, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1489.72s)]
*  Egypt, government and civil society have been trying to act to ease the humanitarian crisis. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1496.2s)]
*  There's a great deal of misinformation happening here in the U.S., in Europe to an extent, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1502.44s)]
*  about the Rafah crossing, which has not been closed by the Egyptian side, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1508.44s)]
*  has actually been bombed several times by the Israeli side and closed several times by the [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1512.04s)]
*  Israeli side as well. There are convoys of humanitarian aid waiting at the Rafah crossing [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1516.6000000000001s)]
*  to cross over to Gaza, and we've been seeing images and hearing interviews from civil society [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1521.64s)]
*  activists from Egypt and elsewhere in the Arab world and the world waiting at the Rafah crossing [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1527.32s)]
*  to pass, and this is not an Egyptian blockade, it's from the other side. One. The second level, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1532.76s)]
*  which is interesting to look at, is a governance crisis that Egypt is afraid of and that is emerging [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1537.3999999999999s)]
*  in Gaza because you cannot only look at what's happening right now in terms of the tragedy [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1543.56s)]
*  unfolding and the huge number of casualties among civilians and the massive destruction happening, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1550.36s)]
*  but we are witnessing the specter of a ground operation that might happen soon. We still have [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1557.16s)]
*  hostages in Gaza, we still have, besides the two and a half million Palestinians, dual national [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1563.0800000000002s)]
*  strats, there are different governance issues emerging, and Egypt is foremost, just like Jordan, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1569.96s)]
*  and it's more relevant in the case of Egypt as of now, is of course very worried about any scenario [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1575.72s)]
*  of displacement, and the position here has been quite clear in many different ways. One, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1581.72s)]
*  that we are against displacement and this is not a government position. I would like everyone who [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1589.16s)]
*  is with us on the call to be aware of the fact that this is not an Egyptian government position, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1593.48s)]
*  this is an Egyptian popular position. The government position is fully backed by the [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1597.56s)]
*  popular sentiment, we will not let our national sovereignty or the borders be abused to solve an [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1601.88s)]
*  Israeli problem of not accepting a two-state solution, of not accepting an end to the [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1608.68s)]
*  occupation, and getting rid of the Palestinian issue. The second level is to organize a clear [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1613.0s)]
*  Arab position, and here bilateral coordination with Jordan has been key. Today, in fact, before [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1620.1200000000001s)]
*  coming to you, there's a press statement which came out from nine Arab countries, Egypt and Jordan, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1625.4s)]
*  with most Gulf countries as well as Morocco condemning not only the atrocities happening [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1632.2s)]
*  in Gaza, but also any talk about displacement and any talk about denying Palestinians their [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1638.28s)]
*  legitimate rights. The third level has been domestically in Egypt to allow for an interplay, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1643.32s)]
*  a positive interplay between government and civil society, which we have been seeing in many [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1648.8400000000001s)]
*  different ways. Last point I would like to make on the Egyptian side, the concern is, and here we [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1653.16s)]
*  can really evoke several moments in the Arab past. We can go back to 1970 in Jordan, we can [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1660.28s)]
*  go back to 1982 in Lebanon, we can go back to 1991 post-liberation of Kuwait war and the Madrid [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1666.04s)]
*  conference. There are concerns cross-regionally about regional security arrangements following [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1673.48s)]
*  what's happening in Gaza. It is clear that Gaza will not be contained to Gaza. There are huge risks [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1679.08s)]
*  about displacement, of evacuation, of, as Mustafa Al Marwan mentioned, that the mass transfer, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1684.52s)]
*  which is being discussed, and there is some language emerging in the Biden administration [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1693.0s)]
*  documents, the request which was put forward to the House of Representatives on October 20, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1697.4s)]
*  very alarming, assigning three and a half billion US dollars to Gazans and Palestinians evacuated [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1702.28s)]
*  to neighboring countries. These are very challenging issues that warrants attention. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1709.56s)]
*  They are getting attention from policymakers in Egypt and they are trying to coordinate [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1714.36s)]
*  regionally and with Europe and the US as well. I see what you're saying, but then what do you [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1718.44s)]
*  tell with a ground invasion looming, as you mentioned, what do you tell 2.3 million trapped [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1725.8s)]
*  in Gaza? Where should they go? What happens? Isn't this also a human responsibility to allow [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1731.08s)]
*  some sort of safe zone, some sort of passage for these people to get out? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1742.04s)]
*  I mean, to be very honest and blunt, Joyce, and I do understand the human suffering happening [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1748.1999999999998s)]
*  and the specter of the ground operation that will definitely result in greater human suffering, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1754.28s)]
*  this is a manipulation of the debate. Israel is an occupying force and as Marwan mentioned, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1760.68s)]
*  Israel actually has never left Gaza. The siege on Gaza almost for two decades has been imposed [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1765.48s)]
*  by Israel. Israel has never left the West Bank. We have an occupation force and it is mandated [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1770.28s)]
*  by international law to be responsible for occupied territories. Israel's withdrawal from [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1775.88s)]
*  Gaza was a one-sided step which did not lead to a Palestinian state. We have a real governance [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1781.3200000000002s)]
*  issue here, a vacuum which Hamas in fact stepped into filling starting 2007 and as Mustafa was [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1786.68s)]
*  mentioning, obstructing all domestic steps on the Palestinian side to get new elections, to get [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1794.1200000000001s)]
*  past the one-party rule in the West Bank as well as in Gaza. PA on the one hand and Hamas on the [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1801.4s)]
*  other hand, all of these steps happened with Israeli blessing, if not due to Israeli policy. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1806.6000000000001s)]
*  So Israel is an occupying force. Israel faces the responsibility of accounting for its [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1812.44s)]
*  responsibilities according to international law and this cannot be pushed on the Jordanian side [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1818.6000000000001s)]
*  or on the Egyptian side. What Egypt can do is to keep working on the humanitarian aid, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1825.0s)]
*  keep working on delaying the ground operation regionally to avert the specter of the ground [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1830.52s)]
*  operation, to work on the release of hostages, protecting humanitarian and civilian population [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1837.64s)]
*  from a humanitarian perspective and mostly being very attentive to its national sovereignty [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1844.1200000000001s)]
*  concerns, its national security concerns that our territory will not be abused to solve a problem [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1849.48s)]
*  which the occupying force created. I mean no easy answers obviously. I want to go to Dr. Berghouti [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1855.64s)]
*  and ask again about the situation in the West Bank. We've seen at least 100 people have been [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1863.48s)]
*  killed since this started. We've already been seeing tension for over the last year in the West [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1872.1200000000001s)]
*  Bank. If a ground invasion happens, how do you see this evolving in Ramallah, in the West Bank more [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1877.88s)]
*  generally? There are two reasons why Hamas attacked. First one is what was happening to [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1886.92s)]
*  the people in the West Bank. During the first eight months before the 7th of October, the Israeli [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1897.24s)]
*  army and Israeli settlers, I remind you, killed no less than 248 Palestinians including 50 children. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1905.72s)]
*  One of them was two and a half years old. The Israeli settlers conducted terror attacks on many [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1917.48s)]
*  communities. You remember the case of Hawara, you remember the case of Tormuz Aya where American [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1923.64s)]
*  Palestinians were attacked and their houses burned etc. During the same period there was [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1928.6000000000001s)]
*  consistent attacks on the Aqsa Mosque and trying to change its nature. There were attacks on Christian [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1934.3600000000001s)]
*  holy places as well with extremists spitting on clerks and on people who were praying there. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1941.4s)]
*  And most important, Netanyahu was advocating that the Palestinian cause will be finished [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1949.88s)]
*  through the normalization of Saudi Arabia which would close the whole cycle of normalization of [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1954.92s)]
*  Arab countries. These were important factors that in my opinion moved Hamas. Hamas is not a [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1959.72s)]
*  government of Gaza. Hamas is a movement of all Palestinians. I mean and for them the issue of [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1969.0s)]
*  Jerusalem is even more important than the issue of any part of Gaza. So to expect that they will [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1976.2s)]
*  just accept to be englaved in Gaza and do nothing about what was happening everywhere [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1982.44s)]
*  was a huge mistake of course. But the West Bank today is facing something horrible. We don't have [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1988.92s)]
*  Hamas government here but what we see now is fragmentation of the West Bank in no less than [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=1997.4s)]
*  224 small ghettos separated from each other by 650 military checkpoints. Many of the military [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2004.52s)]
*  checkpoints are shut off completely. There is a great amount of settlers terror going on everywhere. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2013.4s)]
*  Already we have 20 communities in the West Bank that have been ethnically cleansed by Israeli [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2021.0s)]
*  settler terror and the reality is that Israel is already conducting an act of ethnic cleansing in [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2026.2s)]
*  area C which is no less than 60 percent of the West Bank. That is the reality of what's going on [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2032.8400000000001s)]
*  and even medical services now are prohibited from reaching many communities in area C. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2040.28s)]
*  It's a total amount of humanitarian suffering now also in the West Bank and they cannot blame Hamas [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2047.24s)]
*  for that. This is the doing of the Israeli occupation. Now the question of ground invasion and [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2055.4s)]
*  well Sisi said something very interesting. He said if Israel cares about the people of Gaza while it [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2064.36s)]
*  wants to bombard it completely why don't they let them into Israel? Anyhow 70 percent of these people [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2069.48s)]
*  came from the areas in what is now called Israel. They were ethnically cleansed from there but they [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2075.96s)]
*  don't care about their safety. They don't care about the lives of people. The reality here that [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2082.92s)]
*  should not be ignored is that there is a plan of ethnic cleansing of the Gaza Strip and if that [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2087.96s)]
*  works there will be a plan of ethnic cleansing of West Bank. That's what Egypt and Jordan are so [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2093.96s)]
*  worried about. I'm not bringing in something that is not known. Netanyahu said in the very first [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2100.44s)]
*  beginning of this operation that all Palestinians in Gaza must leave their homes. Where to? [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2107.08s)]
*  Either to the sea or to Egypt and then his spokesperson Richard Richt said something that [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2113.8s)]
*  became the title of the newspaper of Hideo Tahranot where he said that all Palestinians in Gaza must [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2120.04s)]
*  leave their homes and go to Egypt and when Egypt said no Mr Cohen the foreign minister of Israel said [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2126.2000000000003s)]
*  brought about a plan B where he said we will shrink the size of Gaza which means [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2135.2400000000002s)]
*  in case they cannot open the borders and force people out of Gaza they will bring force them [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2143.0s)]
*  out of well north and center of Gaza including Gaza City to the south practically clustering 2.4 [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2148.84s)]
*  million people 2.3 million people in less than 80 square miles and then taking over the north and [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2155.88s)]
*  the center and will never allow any Palestinian to come back there and they will say this is [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2162.84s)]
*  security zone. The plan is very clear and if anybody has doubts I mean you could just [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2167.4s)]
*  refer to what Israeli officials are saying. So we are witnessing here I mean okay you are academics [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2175.88s)]
*  and politicians and people who know the history. Let me remind you that 40 years ago and 35 years [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2185.24s)]
*  ago there was no Hamas. Hamas did not exist but the Palestinian cause existed. What created Fatah [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2193.9599999999996s)]
*  in the first place? Fatah which used to be considered terrorist movement before Hamas [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2201.08s)]
*  became the terrorist movement. Fatah was created because of the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2206.2s)]
*  from Palestine through the erasing of 520 Palestinian communities. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2212.76s)]
*  They became 7 million refugees today. This is the reason and then now they talk about another [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2220.44s)]
*  ethnic cleansing as a solution. Even if they eliminate Hamas which they cannot do because [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2227.7200000000003s)]
*  Hamas is not only in Gaza and Hamas is an idea before it is an organization that doesn't mean I [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2233.32s)]
*  agree with what they did but I say that this is the root problem the cause problem is what Marwan [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2240.28s)]
*  described very well which is the issue of occupation and depriving Palestinians from their basic right [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2246.92s)]
*  of self-determination. Well this cycle will continue and let me remind you it's not just Hamas that is [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2253.5600000000004s)]
*  considered now a terrorist organization. According to American laws in the congress the PLO is still [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2260.6800000000003s)]
*  a terrorist organization. So I mean where is where can we find justice? Finally I tell you I was so [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2267.72s)]
*  alerted and so worried when something happened recently which is the fact that the people of [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2277.48s)]
*  Nagorno-Karabakh the Armenians were practically ethnically cleansed and the fact that the world [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2285.56s)]
*  just watched that and did nothing gives a very serious I'm sure Nathaniel got the message that [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2291.96s)]
*  maybe you can do it too and that's what worries me now. The alternative to this is very simple [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2299.96s)]
*  immediate ceasefire and that will lead to immediate release of the 50 civilians and Israelis [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2307.0s)]
*  with dual nationality for no in exchange for nothing and then we can have exchange of prisoners [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2315.0s)]
*  and then maybe we can have the world paying attention to a new real process that would [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2322.28s)]
*  lead to ending this conflict rather than protracting it. This is one alternative the other alternative [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2327.4s)]
*  ethnic cleansing of Gaza another ground invasion who what do you think this will lead to in the [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2333.88s)]
*  region? I am sure this will be a regional war and this will create instability everywhere in the [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2340.2s)]
*  region is that what Mr Biden wants by just following what Nathaniel tells him? [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2348.52s)]
*  Thank you a lot of points there I don't know if you if it's fair to conclude that the Hamas attack [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2355.48s)]
*  on October 7 played right into the Israeli government hands if what you're talking about [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2363.08s)]
*  ethnic transfers or other or broader takeover in Gaza do you think that October 7 was a mistake [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2368.7599999999998s)]
*  on port of Hamas? I think what happened should not have happened and definitely attacking [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2378.2s)]
*  civilians should not have happened in any way and we'll see what they will say themselves about what [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2388.9199999999996s)]
*  was done but the reality here is that one of the reasons why maybe this has happened is that [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2397.7999999999997s)]
*  is the absolute closure of any perspective of any change of the situation with one gloomy picture [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2407.08s)]
*  of the only process that was happening in the Middle East regarding Palestinians since Trump [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2415.56s)]
*  came to power and Biden continued the same policy of Trump which is liquidating the Palestinian cause [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2421.48s)]
*  and that was a definitely is a motivating factor for anybody. Marwan I want to come back to you on [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2428.44s)]
*  points that Dr Barghouti mentioned Hamas took over Gaza by force in 2007 the goal of the so-called [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2437.0s)]
*  goal initial goal of the Israeli incursion would be to destroy to eliminate Hamas is that realistic [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2447.7200000000003s)]
*  in your opinion and what are your realistic options are out there for the Israelis? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2458.36s)]
*  We remember Joyce that Israel tried to eliminate Hezbollah in Lebanon in 2006 and it was a [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2469.8s)]
*  a long war that did not succeed in eliminating Hamas first Israel is not good at a guerrilla [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2476.28s)]
*  and you know going in Gaza is going to be far more difficult than going in south Lebanon where [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2487.0s)]
*  Gaza has a where Hamas has a network of underground tunnels where the area is extremely crowded [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2494.76s)]
*  where there is no way but to inflict very heavy civilian casualties in any operation. Hamas has [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2503.08s)]
*  become an ideology not just a movement and if Hamas military machine is destroyed you know I'm [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2510.76s)]
*  afraid that many other Hamas's will spring up. Remember again Hezbollah's military machine was [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2520.5200000000004s)]
*  largely destroyed in 2006 today Hezbollah has a far more military strength than it did in 2006 [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2528.2000000000003s)]
*  so that is not going to solve the issue. Military solutions of this kind cannot solve the issue. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2538.2799999999997s)]
*  Only a political process can. The problem with a political process Joyce that I see is that I just [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2545.8799999999997s)]
*  don't see who's going to lead one. After all this is done you know are the Americans going to lead [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2553.56s)]
*  a political process when they one have not done that for the last nine years two when they have [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2562.04s)]
*  a presidential election where Mr. Biden does not want any daylight between his position and that [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2568.36s)]
*  of the Republicans on the peace process. This really government is finished it's gone but it [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2574.6s)]
*  does not mean that any successor to Netanyahu is going to be softer on the peace process than [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2581.72s)]
*  Mr. Netanyahu. Today the divide in Israel is not between the pro-peace and the anti-peace movement [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2589.1600000000003s)]
*  it is between the pro-Netanyahu and anti-Netanyahu forces so it is not clear that any successor [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2596.36s)]
*  Israeli government is going to be more forthcoming when it comes to peace and on the Palestinian [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2602.6000000000004s)]
*  front I totally agree with Mustafa you need elections you know the Palestinian authority has [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2610.68s)]
*  lost all credibility and legitimacy in the eyes of the Palestinian people even before October 7. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2620.04s)]
*  With October 7 I doubt that they have any sort of approval among the Palestinian public. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2627.3999999999996s)]
*  If we are to engage in a political process you need a new Palestinian leadership wherever it [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2635.0800000000004s)]
*  comes from that is more reflective of the views of the Palestinian public. Now all of these are [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2642.6000000000004s)]
*  difficult difficult if not impossible assumptions to meet in the short term so my fear is that a lot [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2650.6800000000003s)]
*  of people are going to lose their lives with no political end in sight not until at least after [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2661.24s)]
*  the US elections can we even hope for a political process and if a political process you know does [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2669.3199999999997s)]
*  happen after the 2024 elections it cannot be a repeat of the past it cannot be a political process [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2678.12s)]
*  that once again engages in never-ending negotiations that never get you anywhere. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2687.56s)]
*  If there is no political process that bluntly ends the occupation it's not going to succeed [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2694.36s)]
*  so in the short term I'm afraid that the the outlook is rather gloomy. Thank you. Celine [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2703.48s)]
*  a very good points by both Marwan and Mustafa how determined is Israel or how bent is the Netanyahu [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2712.6s)]
*  government on launching a ground invasion one and then I'm going to bring in a question from [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2722.76s)]
*  from the audience who would be at the negotiating table if this goes through and let's say they [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2730.2000000000003s)]
*  overthrow Hamas in Gaza what would that even look like what does it post Hamas Gaza look like? [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2737.0s)]
*  Okay first please allow me to react a little bit to some of the comments that were made by [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2747.4s)]
*  Dr. Bagouti that made me a little bit uncomfortable to sit and I just want to [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2757.0s)]
*  and I'm not a politician and a boy generally to kind of enter into this kind of argument [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2767.08s)]
*  and but I find the attempt to link between Hamas decision to perpetuate [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2775.8s)]
*  this barbaric attack between the killing in the West Bank a little bit problematic [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2787.48s)]
*  in the sense that I generally think that Hamas not only does not care about Israeli [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2795.7200000000003s)]
*  fate but also about the fate of the Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank as well and [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2806.1200000000003s)]
*  I don't think that we can bring any rational thinking into the kind of decision that they [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2814.1200000000003s)]
*  have made on September October beyond the fact that they are struggling for the Palestinian [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2821.32s)]
*  and leadership and are also very much interested in bringing the PA down so I don't think that [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2830.12s)]
*  they care that much about Palestinian interests at the civilian level in that context but putting [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2838.52s)]
*  that comment aside and thinking of your question about Netanyahu's where he's looking at I Netanyahu [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2846.8399999999997s)]
*  in general is adverse to big decisions whether it is peace or war and this is something that's [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2858.68s)]
*  very much characterized his thinking is a true believer in the status quo something that we all [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2865.7999999999997s)]
*  know is an illusion and that has led us to the kind of situation and deadlock that we have been [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2875.56s)]
*  seeing in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for so many years what mattered to me here is [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2884.68s)]
*  to reflect on some of the points a very good point that Amir did made is when we look at what [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2896.2s)]
*  next what should be the objective here and I think that the objective should be to lay the foundation [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2904.7599999999998s)]
*  for a different reality one that will prevent such a tragedy from happening again and this [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2911.64s)]
*  requires to prevent a return to status quo and in that sense it's required indeed to [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2919.4s)]
*  to counter Netanyahu's attempt to bring us back to the exact same reality that we have known for the [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2927.08s)]
*  last 12 years in Gaza and that requires a profound shift of paradigm so that the pattern of violence [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2937.72s)]
*  that has led time and you get to the exact same deadlock between Israel and Gaza will end I think [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2945.9599999999996s)]
*  we need to keep that objective in mind when defining the policy that will address the immediate [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2952.6s)]
*  challenge that we are likely to face after the war one of these challenges which Amir outlined [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2958.52s)]
*  is that we will see a post-war governmental vacuum in both civil and security matters [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2969.64s)]
*  and when trying to identify who should be the administration that would run Gaza affairs [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2979.16s)]
*  you mean avoid inside Gaza so you're saying a war a ground invasion would overthrow Gaza from [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2986.44s)]
*  sorry overthrow Hamas from power I think that when we see how Israel has defined the objective [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=2993.96s)]
*  before as dismantling Hamas military and governing capacity there is indeed a risk that we will be [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3000.76s)]
*  facing such a post-war vacuum and that we will see what we have qualified as a Somalia-like kind of [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3008.76s)]
*  reality this is not something that would sell neither Israeli security interest nor the need [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3016.2799999999997s)]
*  for the Palestinian civilian population in Gaza to rebuild and to live in in a sense of security [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3022.52s)]
*  now I think that the challenge here is when we try to identify who should be the administration [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3030.6s)]
*  that would run Gaza affairs that the Palestinian Authority remains a preferred long-term governing [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3036.2s)]
*  alternative but we do recognize when we outline that there is a very difficult challenge [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3042.36s)]
*  that will need to be addressed there is a lack of capacity to control and manage the Gaza Strip we [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3052.6s)]
*  see that the PA also struggle to control part of the West Bank so it's an important question mark [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3060.1200000000003s)]
*  and there is a lack of political legitimacy that the PA is struggling with and to be perceived to [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3069.5600000000004s)]
*  exploit an Israeli operation to regain control of the Strip will be highly problematic and [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3076.2000000000003s)]
*  we contribute for the PA to lose residual legitimacy so the question is how you pave the way [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3084.36s)]
*  for the PA to return under these kind of circumstances so we need to think of you know [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3094.12s)]
*  interim measures but when we outline these measures I think it's very important to relate [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3099.4s)]
*  to the long-term objective that we have this interim measure needs to be connected to the [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3106.92s)]
*  ultimate objective that the PA will be in charge of both the West Bank and Gaza and that we will [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3112.52s)]
*  end the Palestinian division it's also an interest I think for Israel's security because [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3118.36s)]
*  this division I think in my view has been the primarily motivation of these wars [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3126.92s)]
*  not only the aspiration to end the occupation I do not dismiss that this is one of the motivations [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3135.1600000000003s)]
*  but this is not the only motivation now one more point that is very important in my view [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3141.32s)]
*  is that when we try to outline what is required for the PA to be relevant in Gaza we need to [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3147.88s)]
*  recognize that this is not a Gaza only problem and that the PA will reject the possibility to [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3155.56s)]
*  play a role in Gaza when the situation in the West Bank remains as it is it will not be able to [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3165.96s)]
*  be a legitimate player if we continue with the same kind of policy inside the West Bank in parallel [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3173.96s)]
*  and the same will apply regarding the aspiration to see Egypt and other regional player to play a [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3183.5600000000004s)]
*  role in Gaza I don't see them to be capable to play a strong role if in parallel in the West Bank [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3190.76s)]
*  and in Jerusalem we see the kind of same provocation by the Israeli government and [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3197.48s)]
*  therefore when we think about Gaza and a strategy to shift paradigm regarding to Gaza it has to be [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3203.56s)]
*  holistic and it has to refer to the West Bank as well thank you guys can I say something please [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3212.36s)]
*  very quickly because I want to go to Hamer on an important question go ahead it is a great [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3219.32s)]
*  mistake to deal with the matter as if it's a Gaza problem only and why would we as Palestinians [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3225.16s)]
*  accept any kind of foreign control of Gaza or UN control of Gaza Gaza is supposed to be part of [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3231.96s)]
*  the Palestinian state and we are talking if everybody continues to speak about two-state [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3239.0s)]
*  solution I don't know why Gaza should be different from the West Bank but you cannot have two-state [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3244.92s)]
*  solution without ending occupation of both West Bank and Gaza reoccupying Gaza will not [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3250.2s)]
*  solve any problem and the Israeli the Israeli establishment cannot control Gaza if it reoccupies [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3255.7999999999997s)]
*  it again so I think the problem here is very linked and it would be a grave mistake politically [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3262.12s)]
*  and from human perspective to start to treat Gaza and separation from the West Bank that would be a [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3268.68s)]
*  very very wrong mistake on the other hand bringing in the PA or any any kind of puppet [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3275.64s)]
*  group to control Gaza will not also solve the problem if you want to negotiate with [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3282.68s)]
*  Palestinians you need a democratically elected body that that is accepted by the Palestinian [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3287.7999999999997s)]
*  people and that is capable of reflecting and presenting the aspiration of Palestinians [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3294.7599999999998s)]
*  to enforce on Palestinians a leadership that would compromise their their their ultimate goal of [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3301.08s)]
*  becoming free and independent will also not solve the problem thank you Amr I want to go to you we [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3308.12s)]
*  have just in very short time we have a good question from the audience too what what's the [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3317.08s)]
*  role of public protests we're seeing in solidarity with the Palestinians [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3322.7599999999998s)]
*  London Chicago Brooklyn do you have a measurable impact on how this would impact us or Egypt or [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3329.24s)]
*  Jordan's policies and very briefly what what is an outcome that would be acceptable to Egypt from [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3337.72s)]
*  this thank you so much Joyce let me let me start with a second question and I I believe it's too [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3350.04s)]
*  early to speak about outcomes we are in the middle of a war we are in the middle of a humanitarian [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3356.92s)]
*  and governance crisis a humanitarian crisis that has already been unfolding a governance crisis [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3365.24s)]
*  that is emerging and it's definitely a crisis which is not restricted to Palestine and Israel [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3370.12s)]
*  a crisis which has huge regional and international ramifications so it's very difficult to speak [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3377.4s)]
*  about what would be acceptable outcomes let me however outline the policy principles [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3382.44s)]
*  which are pushed forward by the Egyptian government and are supported by the popular [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3389.4s)]
*  sentiment and I believe they are supported by the popular sentiment across the Arab world not only [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3395.56s)]
*  in Egypt or in Jordan as a neighboring country to Palestine and Israel as well [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3400.68s)]
*  the first principle is that and it's a combined principle of rejecting violations of the national [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3406.3599999999997s)]
*  sovereignty of neighboring countries of Israel and Palestine and rejecting the dissolution the [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3414.2799999999997s)]
*  total dissolution of the Palestinian coast via an ethnic cleansing or a mass transfer [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3420.3599999999997s)]
*  what is here at stake is to avoid a new Nakba and I feel that the reference should be used more and [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3428.12s)]
*  more and that in international media and international press coverage we really need to refer to the [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3435.48s)]
*  danger of a new Nakba for the Palestinians and Mustafa's point is why are you deciding for [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3442.7599999999998s)]
*  Palestinians saying that they would like would want to accept an international or an Arab rule [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3448.12s)]
*  of any sorts what is here at stake is avoiding an Akbar via obstructing and stopping plans for [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3454.44s)]
*  ethnic cleansing and mass transfer and allowing Palestinians in a gradual fashion of course with [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3461.48s)]
*  a clear timeline and I'm in favor of what Celine said I mean there are immediate policy measures [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3468.12s)]
*  which need to be taken and pushed forward there are medium term and long term policy measures [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3473.56s)]
*  but the first principle for Egypt is to avoid ethnic cleansing mass transfer and avoid by means [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3477.96s)]
*  of avoiding that any transgressions any violations of our national sovereignty second point is and [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3483.08s)]
*  here is a question about the Egyptian national fabric I mean I feel sometimes that they are [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3489.4s)]
*  in the west policies as well as media are speaking about Egypt very similar to the way they are [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3494.36s)]
*  speaking about Jordan and Palestine without factoring in popular will I mean who told you [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3499.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean as Mustafa said who told you that Palestinians would like to be ruled by Arab or international [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3505.3199999999997s)]
*  governments who told you that Egyptians would accept the resettlement of two and a half million [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3510.52s)]
*  on our territory or that Jordanians are willing to see the nature of the social fabric changed [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3517.88s)]
*  drastically there are existential fears which the government are pushing forward and they reflect [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3524.12s)]
*  popular fears in Egypt that we are against any violation of what our national fabric stands for [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3529.96s)]
*  we are in we are Egypt first and foremost we are an Arab country in solidarity with Palestine [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3536.6000000000004s)]
*  but not at our expense third principle is coordination and negotiation and here I see a [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3542.6000000000004s)]
*  great possibility for a future and a forward-looking policy prescription Egypt is coordinating regionally [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3548.1200000000003s)]
*  Egypt is working with the Europeans and with the U.S. and I realize how how not paralyzed but how [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3555.2400000000002s)]
*  different U.S. interests or different groups within the administration and on capital l [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3561.64s)]
*  are when it comes to this question of Palestine but what Egypt can do is to push forward a [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3566.2799999999997s)]
*  regional international policy prescription for the next day what will happen after the war of course [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3571.96s)]
*  it's important to stop the humanitarian crisis to avert maybe the ground operation if possible [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3578.44s)]
*  to release hostages to ease suffering of civilians but if it does not happen and we come to the ground [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3583.3199999999997s)]
*  operation what will happen next is of grave significance not only for Palestine Israel but [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3589.64s)]
*  for the region as well so the effort diplomatically to push forward a revival of the two-state solution [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3596.3599999999997s)]
*  a revival of Palestinian self-determination I feel joys that the language sometimes is not even used [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3602.52s)]
*  I mean what is here at stake is Palestinian self-determination not ethnic cleansing not mass [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3607.8799999999997s)]
*  transfer this needs to be stopped for for the protests worldwide they are important they make [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3613.4s)]
*  policymakers attentive and Arab governments find themselves in an opportune moment in which [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3620.52s)]
*  both government policies and popular sentiments are in sync so I believe that they are backing [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3627.2400000000002s)]
*  they have a backing nature of what governments especially in Egypt and Jordan are doing and they [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3634.12s)]
*  maybe put some pressure on international policymakers to stop their double standards [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3640.28s)]
*  and the treatment which we've been seeing in the last three weeks thank you [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3645.2400000000002s)]
*  Dr. Masha I want to end with you we're we're already out of time on the regional question [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3650.44s)]
*  this started at this in the same week where you know Washington was being hopeful about a Saudi [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3659.96s)]
*  Israeli normalization where does this all of this the death toll the carnage where does this leave [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3670.28s)]
*  Arab Israeli normalization and you know the the title of this this panel is what comes next [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3680.52s)]
*  so what do you see on on the day after? Washington has reduced peacemaking in the region in the last [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3689.1600000000003s)]
*  few years to normalization agreements with the Arab world that sort of park the Palestinian [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3695.96s)]
*  question aside their thinking was that maybe normalization agreements would create a new [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3702.52s)]
*  environment in the region that makes peace more conducive Israel of course has used this [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3709.8s)]
*  to give themselves the false impression that they can have peace in the region without needing to [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3717.2400000000002s)]
*  come to terms with the Palestinians what October 7 has done is that it has shattered this theory [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3724.12s)]
*  that peace is possible in the region without coming to terms with the Palestinians [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3732.2799999999997s)]
*  in the end it is the Palestinians that are living next to the Israelis it's not the Saudis it's not [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3737.88s)]
*  the Bahrainis it's not the Emiratis and I think and hope that this once and for all brings home [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3744.12s)]
*  the the you know realization that without peace with the Palestinians peace is not going to come [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3752.76s)]
*  to the Middle East that is does not necessarily mean that normalization agreements will stop [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3760.6000000000004s)]
*  I I I think that they will resume frankly after a hiatus of what will happen you know in the next [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDC7hrb_eo&t=3767.0s)]
