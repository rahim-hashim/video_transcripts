# People thought the Arab Spring was over. It obviously is not.
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [October 30, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lva6rOnpcr0)
*  I think what's happening is the latest manifestation of a larger phenomenon taking place in the Arab world, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lva6rOnpcr0&t=0.0s)]
*  which is one that is against corruption, against the lack of good governance, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lva6rOnpcr0&t=7.0s)]
*  and a demand for clean government and a better, larger share in decision-making. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lva6rOnpcr0&t=13.0s)]
*  We have seen this wave not just in Lebanon in the last few months, but also in Algeria, Sudan, Iraq, and now Lebanon, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lva6rOnpcr0&t=21.0s)]
*  and to some extent in Egypt. All of these protests in the last year have some common characteristics, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lva6rOnpcr0&t=29.0s)]
*  whereas a lot of people have written off the Arab Spring and thought it was over, it obviously is not, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lva6rOnpcr0&t=36.0s)]
*  because the problems have not disappeared. This time people appear to be peaceful, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lva6rOnpcr0&t=42.0s)]
*  there are no violence at these demonstrations, and they appear also to reject the binary arguments [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lva6rOnpcr0&t=47.0s)]
*  that Arab governments have used for a long time, either us or the Islamists, either authoritarianism or chaos. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lva6rOnpcr0&t=54.0s)]
*  People are saying, no, we must find a third way, even if that third way is not easy to emerge. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lva6rOnpcr0&t=62.0s)]
*  The Arab world suffers today from a lack of leadership basically among both governments and the opposition alike. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lva6rOnpcr0&t=68.0s)]
*  And so until a system of checks and balances really develops, this is maybe a more mature, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lva6rOnpcr0&t=77.0s)]
*  but still another phase of a long process before the Arab world will arrive at stability and prosperity. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lva6rOnpcr0&t=84.0s)]
