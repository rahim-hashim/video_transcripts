Video Description: Public discourse on Palestine and Israel is often contentious. However, since the Hamas attacks on October 7 and the subsequent, ongoing military response from Israel, the violence has spurred particularly intense debate — as well as dialogue and deliberation — in civil society, college campuses, social media platforms, and boardrooms. For some observers, the debates have also sharpened questions about the assumptions, points of departure, and appropriate norms of discourse in discussions about the conflict. What makes discussions of the situation in Israel and Gaza so contentious, and what can we learn about the role of constructive debate and deliberation in challenging times? 

Join the Carnegie Endowment of International Peace for a conversation about free speech in times of conflict with Tino Cuéllar, Yael Berda, Daniel Levy, and Suha Salman Mousa. The event will be moderated by Julia Ioffe of Puck News.

# Navigating Discourses on Israel and Palestine: Civic Space and Expression in Challenging Times
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [November 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE)

*  I'm a founding partner and Washington correspondent for Puck. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=50.72s)]
*  Thank you so much to Carnegie for inviting me [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=55.18s)]
*  to moderate this discussion with these distinguished panelists. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=57.28s)]
*  I'm going to go ahead and introduce them. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=63.24s)]
*  First, we have with us Tino Cuellar, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  who is the president of Carnegie [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  and a former Supreme Court justice [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=70.60000000000001s)]
*  for the state of California. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=72.76s)]
*  He's also a veteran of two US presidential administrations. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=74.08s)]
*  We also have Yael Berta, who's an associate professor [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=81.12s)]
*  of sociology and anthropology at Hebrew University [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=84.0s)]
*  and a non-resident fellow with the Middle East Initiative [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=87.24s)]
*  at the Harvard Kennedy School. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=90.04s)]
*  She's also a practicing human rights lawyer, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=91.62s)]
*  representing clients in military and different courts, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=94.36s)]
*  as well as the Supreme Court in Israel. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=98.0s)]
*  We also have Suha Salman Moussa, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=100.68s)]
*  who is the executive director of the Mosawah Center, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=103.88s)]
*  well as their sister organization, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=107.2s)]
*  which is called the Friends of Mosawah. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=109.46000000000001s)]
*  She works on the advocacy for Palestinian citizens of Israel. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=111.84s)]
*  And last but certainly not least, we have Daniel Levy, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=115.88s)]
*  who is the president of the US Middle East Project, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=118.48s)]
*  which is focused on finding a mutually agreeable, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=122.0s)]
*  a mutually respectful resolution [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=127.56s)]
*  to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=130.4s)]
*  He has also worked for Eud Barak and Yitzhak Rabin [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=132.68s)]
*  and was deeply involved in the peace talks, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=136.24s)]
*  which we had in a long time. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=140.14s)]
*  Tino, you and I were speaking last night [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=144.66s)]
*  and talking about how difficult this issue [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=146.94s)]
*  has become to discuss. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=150.33999999999997s)]
*  And I said to you, this reminds me increasingly [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=154.61999999999998s)]
*  of that daily show sketch where John Stewart, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=157.14s)]
*  no matter what he said about Israel or Palestine, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=160.45999999999998s)]
*  people pop up from underneath the desk [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=163.22s)]
*  and start screaming at him. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=165.45999999999998s)]
*  And it feels like we're there right now. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=167.38s)]
*  It has become very difficult to discuss this issue. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=172.78s)]
*  And that of course has implications for policy, right? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=176.26s)]
*  If this becomes such a difficult issue to discuss, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=181.72s)]
*  respectfully, calmly, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=185.26s)]
*  then how can we navigate our way out of this? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=187.85999999999999s)]
*  So Tino, I wanted to ask you, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=191.34s)]
*  why do you think this issue is so emotionally charged [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=194.85999999999999s)]
*  and why is it so impossible seemingly [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=200.7s)]
*  to talk about this with people you don't agree with? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=206.42s)]
*  Julia, thank you. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=211.06s)]
*  And I very much appreciate not only your role as moderator [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=211.9s)]
*  and the work that you do, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=214.46s)]
*  but also this extraordinary panel [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=215.36s)]
*  and the work that this panel does. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=217.5s)]
*  I have to say that as we speak, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=219.57999999999998s)]
*  it is just impossible to have a conversation about this [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=221.42s)]
*  without acknowledging the horror of the October 7th attack. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=224.9s)]
*  What it meant for those of us [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=227.14000000000001s)]
*  who have followed international law [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=229.02s)]
*  and international security ethics for a long time, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=230.5s)]
*  it's horrifying. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=235.3s)]
*  And what it meant and how it destroyed so many lives [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=236.5s)]
*  means that you can't have a conversation about discourse [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=240.86s)]
*  and civic space without acknowledging that reality [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=243.70000000000002s)]
*  and that no history, no context justifies that kind of action. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=246.06s)]
*  And we're gonna live with that horror for a long time. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=251.82s)]
*  By the same token, the reason why at this moment, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=254.26s)]
*  discussions of how to go forward, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=258.3s)]
*  how to improve the lives in the region, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=260.86s)]
*  how to take the law and the ethics seriously, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=263.72s)]
*  but at the same time recognize Israel's own determined right [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=265.78000000000003s)]
*  to defend itself, I think it goes to two things. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=270.12s)]
*  The first thing is just the reality that oftentimes [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=274.02s)]
*  when people have disagreements [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=276.78s)]
*  and they go to the essence of who they are [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=278.9s)]
*  and whether they have a right to be in a certain region, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=281.58s)]
*  whether a particular entity has a right to exist, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=283.5s)]
*  it just becomes very difficult to get to the next part [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=285.58s)]
*  of the conversation. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=287.82s)]
*  The question about what to do or what the policy should be. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=289.08s)]
*  That essential starting point in the conversation [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=292.26s)]
*  is one that requires a great deal sometimes of skill, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=296.5s)]
*  patience and empathy to overcome, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=299.53999999999996s)]
*  particularly against the backdrop of such horror. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=301.78s)]
*  That's one. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=303.98s)]
*  Two, my colleagues at Carnegie and I, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=305.46s)]
*  170 scholars in 20 different countries, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=308.34000000000003s)]
*  we grapple with the harder questions, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=311.90000000000003s)]
*  the things that really end up not being easy to resolve [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=314.38s)]
*  overnight or even over a decade, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=317.0s)]
*  what to do about nuclear weapons, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=318.98s)]
*  how to deal with the horrific conflict in Ukraine, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=320.66s)]
*  for example. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=323.78000000000003s)]
*  And here, as we play out what happens next in Israel [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=324.78000000000003s)]
*  and Gaza, it's impossible to deny [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=329.78000000000003s)]
*  that the complexities are real. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=332.42s)]
*  The questions about how exactly you plan an operation [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=334.56s)]
*  to limit the impact on civilians, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=338.53999999999996s)]
*  how exactly you take the law seriously, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=339.97999999999996s)]
*  but at the same time, that sense of urgency [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=341.82s)]
*  that policymakers understandably have [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=344.02s)]
*  as they're trying to protect civilian populations in Israel. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=346.41999999999996s)]
*  So I think it goes to a question about identity, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=349.62s)]
*  but at the same time, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=352.79999999999995s)]
*  the reality that the nuances of policy actually matter. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=354.06s)]
*  And at that point, people, their patience can run out [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=356.7s)]
*  and it's genuinely vaccine, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=360.14s)]
*  even for the most thoughtful experts. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=361.29999999999995s)]
*  Julia. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=368.9s)]
*  Suha, yeah. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=369.73999999999995s)]
*  Showing my age here. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=372.41999999999996s)]
*  So one of the issues that I've encountered [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=375.06s)]
*  in thinking about this, reading about this, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=379.85999999999996s)]
*  reporting on it, writing about it, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=382.62s)]
*  is that sometimes the discourse in our public spaces [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=384.58s)]
*  can feel quite divorced [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=388.41999999999996s)]
*  from what's actually happening on the ground. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=389.97999999999996s)]
*  So I wanted to ask Suha, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=392.78s)]
*  what has life been like for Arab Israelis, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=395.14s)]
*  for Palestinians in Israel, both citizens of Israel [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=400.53999999999996s)]
*  and those living under Israeli occupation in the West Bank, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=404.18s)]
*  you know more about Gaza. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=408.41999999999996s)]
*  What has life been like since October 7th [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=410.78s)]
*  and how did the events of October 7th [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=413.62s)]
*  affect that community? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=417.09999999999997s)]
*  First of all, thank you, Julia, for this question [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=419.78s)]
*  and thank you Carnegie for inviting us [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=422.02s)]
*  and having us in this important webinar. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=424.85999999999996s)]
*  First of all, for the people that do not know, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=428.58s)]
*  the Palestinian Arab community in Israel [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=431.97999999999996s)]
*  is about 21% of the country's population [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=435.06s)]
*  and has historically faced various legal challenges [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=438.97999999999996s)]
*  and oppression. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=443.62s)]
*  But with the outbreak of the war on October 7th, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=445.5s)]
*  these challenges have been increased, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=448.86s)]
*  affecting almost every aspect of our daily lives. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=451.94s)]
*  So in my presentation, per your request, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=455.86s)]
*  I would like to brief about the impact of the war [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=460.14s)]
*  on our community. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=464.7s)]
*  So I will start with the civilian casualties. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=466.22s)]
*  I don't know if anybody knows, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=470.18s)]
*  but on the first day of the war, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=472.26s)]
*  20 civilians from the Bedouin community, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=475.06s)]
*  including women and children, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=479.06s)]
*  have been killed on October 7th. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=481.41999999999996s)]
*  These civilians live in the Negev, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=485.82s)]
*  in the southern of Israel. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=490.5s)]
*  Many others were injured [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=495.02s)]
*  and dozens of houses were destroyed, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=497.21999999999997s)]
*  as well as two people, actually six people, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=500.7s)]
*  were taken as prisoners at Hamas. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=504.26s)]
*  Two of them, by the way, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=507.02s)]
*  a sister and brother will be released today, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=508.09999999999997s)]
*  hopefully in the next hour or two, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=512.14s)]
*  as part of the prisoners exchange deal. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=515.26s)]
*  Most victims are part of thousands of the Bedouin community [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=519.42s)]
*  in the Neqab that live in unrecognized villages, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=523.8199999999999s)]
*  which in regular times has no infrastructures [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=527.3s)]
*  or any basic amenities. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=530.38s)]
*  For instance, no running waters, no electricity. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=533.02s)]
*  And during wartime, they do not have any shelters [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=536.34s)]
*  or any safe rooms. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=540.02s)]
*  And even the Iron Dome didn't work during rockets attacks [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=541.9s)]
*  since it is considered an open spaces or open fields. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=546.3000000000001s)]
*  So the absence of shelters and the Iron Dome [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=553.02s)]
*  forced families, including children, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=555.7s)]
*  into a terrifying reality [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=558.7800000000001s)]
*  where open spaces open provided the only refuge [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=561.62s)]
*  for these families. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=567.22s)]
*  Moreover, these villages lack with basic medical services [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=568.78s)]
*  and even ambulances of Magan David Adom [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=573.66s)]
*  did not provide their services to these communities. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=577.02s)]
*  So since October 7th, the Israeli government declared [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=580.78s)]
*  that Israel is in a war and it's a state of emergency. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=584.46s)]
*  For us, it's meaning military rules [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=588.78s)]
*  that had the directed and the dangerous impact [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=591.94s)]
*  on our community. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=596.7s)]
*  I'll start with the most thing [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=598.3000000000001s)]
*  that we haven't experienced this before, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=601.9000000000001s)]
*  not in 2021, May 2021, or even in October, 2000. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=605.22s)]
*  I'm talking about shrinking spaces [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=610.4200000000001s)]
*  and oppression of freedom of the expression. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=612.4200000000001s)]
*  More than, till today, more than 450 people [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=616.5400000000001s)]
*  from the Palestinian community have been arrested [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=620.4200000000001s)]
*  or investigated because they posted on social media [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=623.1s)]
*  or on WhatsApp groups, posts against the war [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=626.94s)]
*  or showed any solidarity with the people of Gaza [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=631.0200000000001s)]
*  or even write something from the Quran [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=635.1s)]
*  or some student wrote, good morning, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=637.94s)]
*  it's a beautiful morning on the 7th of October [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=640.62s)]
*  with not knowing what's happening on the 7th of October. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=644.3s)]
*  So these arrests targeted especially college [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=647.74s)]
*  and university students, especially females [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=651.54s)]
*  and also lecturers, physicians, medical staff, employees, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=655.14s)]
*  journalists, human rights activists, and et cetera. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=660.6999999999999s)]
*  By the way, in order to humiliate them, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=665.22s)]
*  especially the females and the students [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=667.4599999999999s)]
*  and the spread of fear and terror [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=669.5799999999999s)]
*  among the Palestinian community, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=671.78s)]
*  the police even published videos of their arrests [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=674.86s)]
*  from their bedrooms and then published their photos [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=678.86s)]
*  with their handcuffs and behind them, the Israeli flag [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=682.9399999999999s)]
*  as they were already indicted. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=687.6999999999999s)]
*  As for today, we have more than 90 detainees, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=690.3s)]
*  I'm sorry, we have more than 160 detainees [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=694.9s)]
*  and the police- [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=698.3s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=699.78s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=702.6999999999999s)]
*  Can you hear me? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=705.9s)]
*  Yes, keep going. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=709.3s)]
*  And the police say they find more than 90 charges [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=710.9s)]
*  using the anti-terrorism law in these indictments. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=714.26s)]
*  Moreover, disciplinary actions have been taken [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=719.26s)]
*  against more than 160 students [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=723.5s)]
*  from 33 academic institutes and dozens were expelled [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=726.58s)]
*  from their colleges and universities, including professors. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=731.7800000000001s)]
*  The incitements and the harassments [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=736.7800000000001s)]
*  against students did not stop there. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=739.58s)]
*  I'm pretty sure some of you saw that on Saturday evening, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=742.58s)]
*  October 28th, hundreds of racist groups attacked [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=747.1800000000001s)]
*  physically the dorms in Netanya College, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=751.34s)]
*  demanding to throw out the students, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=753.94s)]
*  the Arab students from their dorms. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=756.58s)]
*  During this dangerous incident, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=759.2600000000001s)]
*  they were shouting death to Arabs and eventually, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=762.5s)]
*  we as the Mosawah Center and the Knesset members [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=767.4200000000001s)]
*  and other political leaders managed after hours [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=770.82s)]
*  to help these students to escape, literally to escape [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=775.3000000000001s)]
*  from their dorms and go back to their families. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=778.7800000000001s)]
*  By the way, the students were not allowed [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=781.74s)]
*  to go back to their dorms. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=784.9s)]
*  Arab students usually in the summertime, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=785.74s)]
*  they work in order to help their parents [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=788.4599999999999s)]
*  to pay the tuition for the college. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=792.26s)]
*  So the organization or the company, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=795.8199999999999s)]
*  I'm sorry, that is managing the dorms, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=801.78s)]
*  they did not allow them to go back to their dorms [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=804.9s)]
*  because they said that this is for security reasons, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=808.78s)]
*  for their security reasons. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=812.3s)]
*  By the way, we at the Mosawah Center filed a lawsuit [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=814.06s)]
*  against the company and yesterday we had a hearing [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=818.3s)]
*  at the court and the judge allowed, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=821.3s)]
*  gave a decision to allow students to go back to their dorms. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=824.9s)]
*  As for workplaces, and this is crucial issue [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=829.0999999999999s)]
*  in our community, there were more than 350 cases [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=832.4599999999999s)]
*  of harassment and discrimination in workplaces [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=837.8199999999999s)]
*  against Arab workers. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=841.42s)]
*  And we dealt with dozens of firing people [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=843.18s)]
*  from their workplaces. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=848.58s)]
*  By the way, we are taking or we are dealing [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=850.82s)]
*  with firing eight female workers from one branch [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=853.22s)]
*  of a known supermarket chain. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=857.86s)]
*  And we're gonna follow up with them on a legal side. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=860.62s)]
*  I think to all what I have been talking, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=867.3s)]
*  the police commissioner is preventing [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=871.9s)]
*  the Palestinian community in Israel [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=873.66s)]
*  from organizing peaceful protests [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=876.3s)]
*  to raise their voice against the war [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=878.9s)]
*  within the Arab towns or villages, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=881.86s)]
*  even like a protest under 50 people, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=884.14s)]
*  which by the way, the law allow it without any permission [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=888.34s)]
*  from the police or the police commissioner, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=893.02s)]
*  the police didn't allow it. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=896.54s)]
*  And few weeks ago, some of the former MKS [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=897.94s)]
*  wanted to protest and hold one sign saying ceasefire. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=903.7800000000001s)]
*  They were arrested and the High Follow-up Committee, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=910.1800000000001s)]
*  the chair of the High Follow-up Committee [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=912.98s)]
*  was arrested in Nazareth on his way to the protest. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=914.58s)]
*  They even prevented by the way, a meeting to take place [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=920.0600000000001s)]
*  between Palestinian citizens, activists [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=924.0200000000001s)]
*  and Jewish citizens activists [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=927.0999999999999s)]
*  to raise their voice against the war. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=928.8199999999999s)]
*  By the way, the oppression and the harassment [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=933.38s)]
*  is also took place against Knesset members [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=939.02s)]
*  like Aida Thomas Liman and Yaseen. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=946.02s)]
*  They were suspended from attending the Knesset meetings, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=949.02s)]
*  Aida Thomas Liman for I think two months [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=958.22s)]
*  and Iman Khatib Yaseen for two weeks by the way, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=961.22s)]
*  and as well of Ofer Kasif. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=964.62s)]
*  So these are some of the daily cases [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=966.98s)]
*  or topics of the Knesset. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=973.6999999999999s)]
*  Cases or topics or harassment or attacks, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=976.7399999999999s)]
*  whatever you wanna call it or silencing us [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=981.8599999999999s)]
*  that we are dealing with. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=984.8599999999999s)]
*  Adding to all that, the Israeli government, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=986.38s)]
*  they have trying to implement and to pass a dangerous policies [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=989.18s)]
*  and propose such policies. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=997.2199999999999s)]
*  For instance, the passage of extension [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=999.66s)]
*  of the counter-terrorism law, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1002.54s)]
*  the conception of terror publications [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1006.2199999999999s)]
*  that could lead to a year in prison [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1009.54s)]
*  the conception of material. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1014.7399999999999s)]
*  They say that as a potential leading of self brainwashing, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1017.5799999999999s)]
*  there was a proposed bill in the Knesset [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1022.78s)]
*  which seeks to introduce a death penalty [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1026.1399999999999s)]
*  for terrorism offenses, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1029.34s)]
*  as well as the far right National Security Minister, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1031.6599999999999s)]
*  Ben Gver, he initiated what is called [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1035.22s)]
*  unarmed local petrol groups in Hebrew called [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1041.38s)]
*  Kitot Kunanut and eased the requirements [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1045.34s)]
*  for obtaining gun license for civilians. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1048.94s)]
*  And I'm talking about civilians, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1051.82s)]
*  Jewish civilians, Jewish Israelis, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1054.02s)]
*  because his argument is that they want to protect [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1057.42s)]
*  the Jewish neighborhoods from Arab citizens [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1062.74s)]
*  of the state of Israel. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1065.5s)]
*  Yeah, I'm concluding to conclude it's important [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1068.66s)]
*  to acknowledge that there is a rise in hate crime [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1071.18s)]
*  and increase in physical and verbal assaults [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1074.5s)]
*  against Palestinian Arab citizens. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1077.66s)]
*  And no one from the Jewish Israeli citizens [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1079.7s)]
*  who attacked Palestinian citizens, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1082.42s)]
*  including the ones who attacked the students in Netanya [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1084.3400000000001s)]
*  has no one was arrested [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1088.3000000000002s)]
*  or even investigated. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1091.98s)]
*  We are facing an organized racist incitement, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1094.38s)]
*  a campaign by the ultra right wing associations [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1097.78s)]
*  and parties aim to delegitimize our community [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1101.46s)]
*  and the goal also to digitalize [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1105.9s)]
*  the progressive Arab Jewish movement. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1109.02s)]
*  Thank you Suha for that heart rending [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1113.3s)]
*  and honestly, impurating update. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1116.66s)]
*  Yael, I wanted to ask you about the Israeli side [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1119.62s)]
*  and there have been also reports [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1124.3799999999999s)]
*  that it is harder for Israelis to express opinions [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1127.1s)]
*  that are not maybe in line with [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1132.2199999999998s)]
*  what the government is pushing. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1134.34s)]
*  What has October 7th and the war in Gaza [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1136.6999999999998s)]
*  done to civic spaces in Israel? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1141.6599999999999s)]
*  And I ask you this as an expert in the topic. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1145.06s)]
*  What does it feel like for Israelis? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1150.3799999999999s)]
*  So first of all, thank you very much [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1154.3s)]
*  for holding this meeting. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1156.6599999999999s)]
*  I think it's really very important [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1158.7399999999998s)]
*  and thank you Suha for your words. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1160.9799999999998s)]
*  I wanna reiterate and acknowledge October 7th [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1164.3s)]
*  as this historic event [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1168.4599999999998s)]
*  and how deeply affected [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1172.58s)]
*  all of Israel is, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1176.26s)]
*  both Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1178.3s)]
*  This is very important. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1182.3s)]
*  So the way it's affecting also [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1183.1399999999999s)]
*  the citizenship structure itself. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1185.4199999999998s)]
*  But I'm not gonna go into that [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1189.22s)]
*  because it's a little complicated. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1190.54s)]
*  I also wanna acknowledge the horrific [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1193.34s)]
*  civilian casualties in Gaza. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1196.82s)]
*  And I think one can't speak about at this moment [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1199.3s)]
*  without acknowledging that. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1203.1799999999998s)]
*  And I think the impacts of that devastation [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1205.4599999999998s)]
*  are just as important for our understanding, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1209.4599999999998s)]
*  for our analysis and for our ability to move forward. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1212.6999999999998s)]
*  So just as we acknowledge the horrific atrocities [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1216.58s)]
*  that I can't fathom why people can't [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1221.02s)]
*  address them sometimes, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1224.3s)]
*  we have to acknowledge how many people [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1227.54s)]
*  we have to acknowledge, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1231.1s)]
*  how intertwined and interconnected we all are in this land. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1233.1399999999999s)]
*  And so, yeah, sorry. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1237.6999999999998s)]
*  I just wanna say, yeah, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1241.1799999999998s)]
*  but I just wanted to interrupt. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1243.8999999999999s)]
*  Saying what I just said in this panel, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1246.5s)]
*  I probably could not say it [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1248.82s)]
*  unless I was taking part [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1251.8999999999999s)]
*  in Zoom or a webinar [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1254.1799999999998s)]
*  with Jews and Israelis, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1260.18s)]
*  Jews and Palestinian Israelis together. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1265.3s)]
*  There would be no way to actually say what I just said [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1268.54s)]
*  because even the expression of sadness or regret [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1271.26s)]
*  over the civilian casualties in Gaza [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1277.1000000000001s)]
*  is considered to be something that is outside [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1279.5s)]
*  a legitimate speech. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1283.74s)]
*  So it's not just about organizing a protest, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1288.74s)]
*  which one can't do. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1292.7s)]
*  I mean, there was one protest [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1294.14s)]
*  that was enabled by the Supreme Court. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1295.3s)]
*  One had to petition the Supreme Court in order to do that, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1298.58s)]
*  but it's literally wherever one goes, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1301.74s)]
*  the people are very careful and fearful [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1307.7s)]
*  of what they're saying. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1312.3s)]
*  And even the expression of doubt [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1313.78s)]
*  about Israeli military tactics and results. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1316.74s)]
*  I mean, this is all something [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1320.7s)]
*  that people are very careful about. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1322.7s)]
*  Now, it's also coming from the government, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1325.34s)]
*  but it's also social pressure. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1328.98s)]
*  We have to always remember that interconnection there. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1330.38s)]
*  And the way that legitimacy narrows [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1333.58s)]
*  because that's exactly what happens to civic space. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1339.46s)]
*  It's never only about government measures. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1341.66s)]
*  It's never only about official blocks and impediments. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1344.46s)]
*  It's about what we deem possible [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1351.4199999999998s)]
*  to talk about in public sphere. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1354.7s)]
*  And so I wanna go into a little bit. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1357.3s)]
*  So Suha has spoken about what's happening [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1363.78s)]
*  in academic spaces, but we have to also realize [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1367.94s)]
*  that this is happening in universities [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1375.1s)]
*  after the universities are pushing back [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1379.3s)]
*  the minister of education that wanted to have direct oversight [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1382.26s)]
*  over any of these cases. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1387.86s)]
*  So this is even happening with an intervention [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1391.34s)]
*  demanding independence of the academic institution. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1395.06s)]
*  So just to kind of frame it. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1398.3s)]
*  I think maybe even more important [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1401.78s)]
*  is what is happening on social media. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1404.86s)]
*  Palestinian citizens of Israel are not on social media. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1408.86s)]
*  I mean, they can't be. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1414.02s)]
*  And when they are, they're posting pictures [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1416.8999999999999s)]
*  of cats and roses because there's such a deep fear. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1418.78s)]
*  And it's even in WhatsApp groups. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1423.54s)]
*  Now, I wanna talk about this for a minute [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1425.86s)]
*  in conjunction with the political crisis inside Israel. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1427.74s)]
*  Because people sometimes forget [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1433.22s)]
*  that we are actually amidst a massive political crisis [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1436.1s)]
*  where there was, the government introduced a judicial [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1440.82s)]
*  overhaul, which some of us call the regime coup. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1444.62s)]
*  And there has been a protest movement for 10 months [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1449.8999999999999s)]
*  that was protesting basically authoritarian practices [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1454.1s)]
*  that Netanyahu's government was introducing. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1459.4599999999998s)]
*  And so what's happening now is that whole gambit [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1463.26s)]
*  of laws, of policies, of directives [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1467.86s)]
*  that they tried to do the previous to October 7th [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1472.5s)]
*  under the guise of the war. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1477.54s)]
*  Some of the government's ministers are pushing [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1479.98s)]
*  those policies with great success [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1483.7s)]
*  because of the impossibility to protest. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1486.5s)]
*  And so I think also another thing [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1490.14s)]
*  that we have to remember is the hostages. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1493.0600000000002s)]
*  So most of the civic issue in Israel [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1496.6200000000001s)]
*  is to bring back the hostages. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1501.94s)]
*  And that's where we actually see a lot [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1504.02s)]
*  of the political energy going to. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1506.94s)]
*  In a kind of, if you wanna speak civilian, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1510.74s)]
*  you speak about saving life. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1514.64s)]
*  And that's something important to watch [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1516.76s)]
*  and also thankfully has been successful at this until now. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1519.68s)]
*  And I hope it continues. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1526.2s)]
*  And we see more release of all the hostages. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1528.1200000000001s)]
*  But all this to say that there's a direct relationship [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1533.0800000000002s)]
*  between what's happening on the ground. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1537.72s)]
*  So one can't say, oh, okay, there's a war. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1541.24s)]
*  This is why these policies are taking place. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1543.96s)]
*  It has everything to do with the attempt [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1547.04s)]
*  to go full authoritarian by Netanyahu's government. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1550.84s)]
*  I realized that what I'm saying sounds very dramatic. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1554.52s)]
*  The reason that I'm sounding so dramatic is because it is. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1558.2s)]
*  Like way before October 7th, we were sounding alarms [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1562.24s)]
*  that all stops were like being pulled on free speech, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1567.8000000000002s)]
*  on oversight of the police, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1573.64s)]
*  on the massive use of the anti-terrorism law. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1576.52s)]
*  This was already happening. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1580.44s)]
*  And now it's just under the flag of war. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1581.76s)]
*  All of it is happening to a great extent. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1584.94s)]
*  Yeah, Yael, what you're saying actually reminds me [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1588.04s)]
*  of President Biden's words right after October 7th, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1590.52s)]
*  when he warned President Netanyahu [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1594.36s)]
*  or Prime Minister Netanyahu, excuse me, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1596.72s)]
*  to not repeat the mistakes that America committed [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1600.28s)]
*  after 9-11, which was a lot of this, right? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1604.96s)]
*  Under the flag of war, you push through a lot [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1607.6s)]
*  of authoritarian or authoritarian-like measures. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1609.6799999999998s)]
*  And the reason I interrupted you earlier is, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1614.24s)]
*  I guess it's actually more of a question for Daniel, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1617.08s)]
*  is that exactly what you were saying [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1621.12s)]
*  that holding both the sadness and the grief [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1623.6s)]
*  for both of those things, both what happened on October 7th, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1627.04s)]
*  which we're still learning more and more about, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1630.6799999999998s)]
*  especially as details of the sexual assault [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1633.0s)]
*  and rape come to light, as well as the Israeli offensive [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1636.84s)]
*  in Gaza and the massive humanitarian disasters created, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1644.78s)]
*  the catastrophic loss of life, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1649.6399999999999s)]
*  that somehow you can't, we're no longer in a place, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1652.52s)]
*  it seems, in Israel, outside of it, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1657.6s)]
*  where you can hold sadness and grief for both those things [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1659.88s)]
*  and not, like in the Jon Stewart sketch, get yelled at. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1663.08s)]
*  Daniel, you're in the West, you're in the diaspora. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1667.1200000000001s)]
*  Why are those two things compatible in so many people? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1674.32s)]
*  And how are the labels that are being tossed around [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1678.84s)]
*  by both sides affecting the chance of this coming [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1683.4399999999998s)]
*  to some kind of mutually acceptable political resolution? [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1690.04s)]
*  Because this is at a core political crisis. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1694.76s)]
*  Indeed, and thanks, Julia, and it's good to be on the panel [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1700.4199999999998s)]
*  with the others. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1705.4199999999998s)]
*  I'm kind of expecting those heads to pop up [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1709.52s)]
*  from the Jon Stewart's. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1713.56s)]
*  People have to look it up, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1714.6799999999998s)]
*  because otherwise they'll have no idea [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1715.6s)]
*  what we've been riffing on. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1717.52s)]
*  But it's nice to have a rare smile on one's face [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1719.48s)]
*  talking about these things. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1722.28s)]
*  And unfortunately, that smile will be banished now [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1723.52s)]
*  as one dives into it. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1726.08s)]
*  So I've tried to make the case a little bit [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1728.9199999999998s)]
*  of along the lines that you've just suggested. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1734.28s)]
*  In these past weeks, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1736.6399999999999s)]
*  that I don't know how one can come at this [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1740.2s)]
*  without being able to hold simultaneously three thoughts. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1744.44s)]
*  And for me, those consist of the following. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1750.24s)]
*  Number one, October 7th was a horrendous attack, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1753.32s)]
*  which cannot be justified. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1759.76s)]
*  By the way, I think there are accusations [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1762.72s)]
*  as to what happened on October 7th, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1766.92s)]
*  which have not been verified, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1769.56s)]
*  and which could end up undermining the reality [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1771.52s)]
*  of what happened on October 7th. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1774.72s)]
*  And I would urge kind of, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1776.28s)]
*  and there are things that have had to be taken down online. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1779.22s)]
*  So I would urge kind of the Israeli PR machine [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1781.84s)]
*  not to go there, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1784.32s)]
*  because I think it's a stupid, dangerous place to go, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1785.2s)]
*  because October 7th was horrendous enough. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1788.2s)]
*  And one has to be able to hold [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1790.88s)]
*  the fullness of that horror. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1792.72s)]
*  Number two, what has been done [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1795.0400000000002s)]
*  to the Palestinian civilian population of Gaza [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1797.7600000000002s)]
*  basically every day since is horrendous [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1800.6000000000001s)]
*  and will almost certainly also amount to a war crime [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1804.2800000000002s)]
*  when the fullness of that investigation is pursued. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1808.66s)]
*  The fact that on day one, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1812.72s)]
*  the first response was to announce [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1814.72s)]
*  the collective punishment of the civilian population [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1819.04s)]
*  with the ending of food, water, medical supplies, assistance, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1822.18s)]
*  and it has only got worse since then. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1826.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, to be frank, that the New York Times [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1830.74s)]
*  can run a story which says, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1834.36s)]
*  "'By conservative estimate, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1835.8799999999999s)]
*  "'the number of Palestinian women and children [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1838.36s)]
*  "'killed in two months in Gaza [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1840.62s)]
*  "'is double the number of women and children [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1842.74s)]
*  "'killed in almost two years in Ukraine.'" [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1845.44s)]
*  That just takes time to sink in. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1849.24s)]
*  One fears we could be back there within a few days [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1852.24s)]
*  and it's worth looking up what Dr. Tudras, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1854.6399999999999s)]
*  the head of the World Health Organization, has said today, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1857.52s)]
*  because not only is it now the death [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1860.24s)]
*  from direct bombardment, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1861.84s)]
*  but it's also the impact of the dire humanitarian conditions, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1863.5s)]
*  sanitation conditions, absence of clean water, et cetera, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1868.1399999999999s)]
*  and the disease that is rampant. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1871.72s)]
*  So hold those two things. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1875.02s)]
*  Then one has to hold another thing, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1876.72s)]
*  which importantly does not justify anything, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1880.18s)]
*  but one cannot understand without context. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1884.6200000000001s)]
*  On October 6th, Israelis lived a pretty normal life. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1889.44s)]
*  On October 6th, Palestinians were subject [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1894.96s)]
*  to the structural violence of a permanent military occupation [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1898.92s)]
*  on a regime that has been with a high degree [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1904.0s)]
*  of legal accuracy defined as meeting the definition [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1907.8s)]
*  of apartheid, not only by Palestinians, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1912.6s)]
*  but by Israeli human rights organizations, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1915.12s)]
*  and of course by Human Rights Watch [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1917.6s)]
*  and Amnesty International in the last two to three years. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1919.16s)]
*  Now, why is it so difficult [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1922.44s)]
*  to hold those three things simultaneously? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1924.56s)]
*  And that, I think, takes us into the terrain [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1927.1s)]
*  of this conversation around the discourse, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1929.88s)]
*  because the starting point has tended not to be that, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1932.88s)]
*  but the starting point, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1936.88s)]
*  and because this is sensitive stuff, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1938.24s)]
*  I'm gonna look at some things I jotted down earlier, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1939.68s)]
*  but I'm not gonna take too long, I promise. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1943.94s)]
*  The starting point has tended to be evocations of fear, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1945.6200000000001s)]
*  trauma, hierarchies of victimhood, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1949.5400000000002s)]
*  exceptionalist demands for denunciation. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1952.92s)]
*  And it becomes so difficult [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1956.6000000000001s)]
*  because it's embedded in a story, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1959.56s)]
*  and you said I'm in diaspora, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1964.36s)]
*  which is of course a very loaded term, right? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1965.9199999999998s)]
*  Diaspora applies, there's a center and there's an outside. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1968.96s)]
*  And so unfortunately, and I think this makes it [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1973.46s)]
*  really difficult for people, not of my community, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1976.44s)]
*  not of my faith, to feel how do I get into this? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1979.6s)]
*  Because this also comes down to [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1984.32s)]
*  what does Jewish identity look like [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1987.04s)]
*  for an awful lot of the community [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1990.92s)]
*  and the extent to which Israel [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1995.52s)]
*  has become the secular religion for so many people [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=1998.18s)]
*  of a Jewish background, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2002.6s)]
*  and the role that antisemitism [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2006.16s)]
*  and how it has transitioned in how it's defined [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2009.24s)]
*  has come to play. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2012.76s)]
*  So there is, of course, a history [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2014.04s)]
*  of thousands of years of Jewish life, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2019.9599999999998s)]
*  and then there's a history of how diaspora interacts [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2021.84s)]
*  with Israel in the age of Zionist hegemony. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2028.48s)]
*  And it has gone through different iterations, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2032.1599999999999s)]
*  pre-state, immediately post-state, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2035.36s)]
*  people, and I won't have time to go into it, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2038.04s)]
*  something like the Blaustein-Bengurion understandings, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2040.48s)]
*  where actually mainstream American Jewish communal [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2044.28s)]
*  leadership early on said, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2047.08s)]
*  hey, we speak for the Jews in America. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2048.92s)]
*  Israel will support you, but stay out of our affairs. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2051.08s)]
*  We are the interpreters and the defenders of Jewish life. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2055.0s)]
*  Until you've reached this moment of, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2057.84s)]
*  probably right now we are in the moment [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2061.44s)]
*  of maximum symbiosis between those two things. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2063.52s)]
*  Now, you can only make sense of this [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2068.16s)]
*  if one understands that at a certain point, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2072.44s)]
*  and I think this is rational [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2077.8799999999997s)]
*  in terms of Israeli statecraft, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2081.0s)]
*  that at a certain point the state of Israel realized [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2083.3199999999997s)]
*  things are not going to get better for the Palestinians. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2087.8999999999996s)]
*  That's not the policy. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2090.3199999999997s)]
*  People are increasingly going to call out [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2092.22s)]
*  the realities on the ground, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2094.56s)]
*  and perhaps one of the best tools in opposing that [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2096.48s)]
*  is to go on a journey of redefining [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2099.42s)]
*  what constitutes antisemitism. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2101.32s)]
*  So change the terms of the debate. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2103.32s)]
*  Rather than responding to how do you answer the fact [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2105.4s)]
*  that your state is an apartheid state, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2109.76s)]
*  if you were Israel, you'd much rather [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2111.98s)]
*  be having the argument, well, how dare you say that [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2113.44s)]
*  you must be an antisemite? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2116.68s)]
*  And here I've teed up a definition of antisemitism, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2118.08s)]
*  which means the very framing of that question [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2120.86s)]
*  means you've violated that. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2123.92s)]
*  I am lusting amongst others has written [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2126.04s)]
*  of the holocaust ization [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2128.04s)]
*  of how we see the Palestine conflict. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2130.7200000000003s)]
*  It's not new. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2132.76s)]
*  Menachem Begin in the Lebanon war talked about Arafat [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2134.2000000000003s)]
*  being in the equivalent of Hitler's bunker. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2138.36s)]
*  There's a government ministry in Israel was created [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2142.52s)]
*  to run this campaign of delegitimization [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2146.12s)]
*  of criticism of Israel. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2148.6400000000003s)]
*  So you get to this place where October 7th happens, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2149.7200000000003s)]
*  and it's autoplay. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2155.32s)]
*  The terrain has been primed for a certain kind of debate, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2157.7200000000003s)]
*  which is a debate that is absolutely antithetical [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2163.14s)]
*  to problem solving. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2165.8s)]
*  And if, yeah, there have been, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2167.18s)]
*  people may have come across what Omar Bartol [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2169.92s)]
*  at Brown University has been saying, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2172.6s)]
*  and I'd urge people to look it up if they haven't seen it. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2174.4s)]
*  So this is one of the preeminent Jewish Israeli [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2177.56s)]
*  genocide holocaust scholars who's looking at this [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2180.52s)]
*  and screaming really about what's going on. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2183.76s)]
*  And it's dismissed. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2186.44s)]
*  Many of the most preeminent tenured holocaust Jewish studies, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2188.0400000000004s)]
*  Jewish history scholars are being totally dismissed [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2192.0400000000004s)]
*  because it doesn't fit in the narrative. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2194.8s)]
*  And when people look and say, wow, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2196.5600000000004s)]
*  those Jewish voice for peace, those, if not now guys, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2198.96s)]
*  they seem pretty worked up and agitated, don't they? [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2202.6800000000003s)]
*  And I think they're so agitated because this feels to them [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2206.1600000000003s)]
*  like they are doing the most Jewish thing. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2211.1600000000003s)]
*  And yet it is very marginalized in the community [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2213.28s)]
*  because the terrain has been so primed. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2215.48s)]
*  Let me make one last comment if I may, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2217.0s)]
*  because I think this is crucial. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2219.2400000000002s)]
*  If you add another layer to this very problematic reality [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2222.88s)]
*  that I've described, which is power asymmetries. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2229.84s)]
*  So there's a power asymmetry over there [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2234.52s)]
*  where Ya'el and Suha are. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2236.8s)]
*  And that's the power asymmetry between an occupying state [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2238.92s)]
*  and an occupied people. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2242.56s)]
*  But there's a power asymmetry in Western democracy [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2244.4s)]
*  and in the US. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2247.2799999999997s)]
*  And maybe I can best capture that power asymmetry [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2248.64s)]
*  by calling it campus versus Congress. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2251.44s)]
*  So campus may sound very loud, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2254.64s)]
*  but Congress is where you appropriate money and weaponry [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2257.4s)]
*  to send to one side of this conflict. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2262.4s)]
*  And that power asymmetry, I think also leads [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2265.32s)]
*  to people thinking, how do we get our voice heard [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2268.6s)]
*  in a democracy where even where much of the public is at, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2272.04s)]
*  where justice seems to be at is totally out of kilter [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2276.64s)]
*  with where our political dynamics are at. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2280.84s)]
*  Someone has called this, well, I mean, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2283.24s)]
*  someone called reported on several meetings [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2284.96s)]
*  with racial justice advocates and said, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2288.16s)]
*  people were calling this a global George Floyd moment. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2290.12s)]
*  And let me say as a last sentence, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2293.52s)]
*  it may be a long sentence, but not that long sentence. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2297.36s)]
*  What I fear amongst other things is of course [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2302.36s)]
*  for the situation over there. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2306.48s)]
*  And I think this is an administration [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2308.4s)]
*  that has now thoroughly tied itself up in knots [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2310.52s)]
*  and is bleeding political capital, [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2313.7599999999998s)]
*  is bleeding global credibility, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2316.6s)]
*  but also people are just bleeding. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2319.0s)]
*  And alongside that, it leads us to, I think, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2321.72s)]
*  the worst place we could be at a time [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2326.48s)]
*  where there is rising intolerance, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2330.24s)]
*  where there is rising right wing, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2332.52s)]
*  ethno nationalist extremism, far right extremism, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2335.08s)]
*  where you have communities that are all impacted by that, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2340.6s)]
*  absolutely at loggerheads with each other, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2344.3599999999997s)]
*  unable to do joint anti-racism work. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2346.2s)]
*  And you end up having people saying things like, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2351.0s)]
*  in my community saying things like, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2355.4399999999996s)]
*  this can never happen in the only place in the world [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2357.2799999999997s)]
*  where Jews are supposed to be safe. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2361.2s)]
*  Because just think about that for a moment. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2362.56s)]
*  And again, it goes back to this question of diaspora. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2364.8399999999997s)]
*  Wait, have you preemptively given up the idea [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2367.3999999999996s)]
*  that Jews in America are supposed to be safe? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2370.08s)]
*  Jews in Britain, Jews in Germany are supposed to be safe? [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2372.2s)]
*  So we get ourselves into a contortionist space, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2375.04s)]
*  which I think is really to the detriment of the communities [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2379.2799999999997s)]
*  at loggerheads with each other. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2382.08s)]
*  Thank you, Daniel. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2386.9199999999996s)]
*  I think you've hit on a lot of important points. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2388.8s)]
*  And I wonder how much of that is because October 7th [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2391.56s)]
*  it's such a nerve, and it hit, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2399.8s)]
*  it access such deep historical trauma, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2402.6s)]
*  not just for Jews in Israel, but for Jews in the, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2406.84s)]
*  and I say the diaspora because we're talking to people [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2409.7200000000003s)]
*  on the panel who are actually there on the ground. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2413.28s)]
*  Can I just take one sentence on that, Julia? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2416.48s)]
*  Sure, of course. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2418.7200000000003s)]
*  Thanks, because I think you're absolutely right. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2420.28s)]
*  And that is the most accessible sentence [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2423.1200000000003s)]
*  to Jewish communities, and it's the most accessible sentence [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2426.04s)]
*  to the mainstream media in America. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2429.36s)]
*  However, what has happened subsequent to October 7th [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2432.28s)]
*  hits an incredibly painful nerve for Palestinians. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2436.6000000000004s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2440.56s)]
*  And for the Nakba, and when Israeli politicians [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2441.6000000000004s)]
*  openly talk about the, and that does not hit [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2444.6s)]
*  an accessible nerve for people who are exposed [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2448.68s)]
*  to your mainstream media. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2451.08s)]
*  That hits a weight. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2452.44s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2453.24s)]
*  Nuck what, nuck who? [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2454.08s)]
*  I'm gonna Google that. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2456.08s)]
*  Holocaust, I know. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2457.52s)]
*  Nakba, years, decades of Palestinian dispossession, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2459.0s)]
*  decades of structural violence. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2464.32s)]
*  This stuff I'm not really so familiar with. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2465.96s)]
*  And that's part of the problem, of course. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2468.6s)]
*  Sure, though I would argue that's changing, [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2471.92s)]
*  especially in the US, and I would say in the UK, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2474.7599999999998s)]
*  where the populations, especially the younger population, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2476.96s)]
*  are much more diverse and have access [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2479.7999999999997s)]
*  to diverse points of view. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2483.3999999999996s)]
*  One last thing I'll say before I open it up for questions [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2487.2s)]
*  is, and I'm expecting the heads to pop up and yell at me, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2490.56s)]
*  but I've seen, just as somebody who has covered [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2495.12s)]
*  the war in Ukraine the entire time it's been happening, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2498.92s)]
*  I've seen a lot of comparisons between the death tolls, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2503.56s)]
*  and I think we also are in danger of getting into, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2506.64s)]
*  like you said, victim hierarchies, et cetera. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2510.92s)]
*  The verified death toll in Ukraine is quite low, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2513.84s)]
*  and it is much certainly multiples higher. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2517.88s)]
*  It's been very slow to catch up in Ukraine for some reason [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2520.4s)]
*  to the actual deaths, but that is neither here nor there. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2523.88s)]
*  I wanna open this up for audience questions. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2527.2s)]
*  We have about 15 minutes. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2531.0s)]
*  I just wanted to make two quick observations. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2534.2400000000002s)]
*  I appreciated the distinction Daniel was drawing [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2536.48s)]
*  between campus and Congress, and I acknowledge that, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2539.56s)]
*  but I also wanted to note that one should not undersell [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2541.7200000000003s)]
*  the enormous importance of campuses [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2545.04s)]
*  as areas where discourse develops and begins to influence [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2547.2000000000003s)]
*  the rest of the country ultimately, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2551.28s)]
*  and particularly at a generational level, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2552.96s)]
*  gives you a sense of where the discourse is going. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2554.6800000000003s)]
*  That makes me concerned about anti-Semitism. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2556.96s)]
*  Like, you know, I don't think that in any way, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2558.88s)]
*  sort of cast aside some of the issues [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2562.48s)]
*  we've talked about here, but you know, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2565.16s)]
*  in the US, just to pick one statistic, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2566.48s)]
*  the FBI indicates that in 2022, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2568.48s)]
*  55% of the religion-focused hate crimes [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2572.64s)]
*  were against folks who were Jewish. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2575.84s)]
*  And I do think that the challenge we are all facing, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2579.2400000000002s)]
*  in a sense, you know, we may disagree about this [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2582.92s)]
*  or that particular detail, but what I think cuts [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2585.48s)]
*  across every statement here, is the importance [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2587.8s)]
*  of building in enough room for honest, respectful [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2591.6s)]
*  discussion and deliberation. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2595.64s)]
*  I do not see how we get to a place [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2597.64s)]
*  where there are fewer Palestinian lives being lost. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2599.72s)]
*  For example, as Israel legitimately defends its interests [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2602.2s)]
*  without some of that open discussion and honesty [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2605.44s)]
*  and ability to connect with each other. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2608.52s)]
*  And I do think it's worth noting that that requires [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2610.2799999999997s)]
*  more than the right government policy, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2612.7599999999998s)]
*  although it does require that, right? [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2615.04s)]
*  Governments have a right to stop incitement to violence, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2616.64s)]
*  to stop direct material support, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2620.08s)]
*  but ideally not to cut off the kind of deliberation [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2622.56s)]
*  and discussion that lets people hear each other [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2626.6s)]
*  and understand each other and change minds. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2629.44s)]
*  But it also requires norms of discourse and respect [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2631.6s)]
*  and ability to hold those multiple thoughts [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2634.44s)]
*  that Daniel was talking about. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2636.68s)]
*  So to my mind, that is work for all of us. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2638.24s)]
*  It means sometimes reconciling our emotions [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2641.4s)]
*  with our thoughts, but also trying to keep [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2644.3199999999997s)]
*  the emotional piece to one side enough [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2646.7999999999997s)]
*  that we can listen to each other and understand [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2649.24s)]
*  a perspective from somebody who disagrees with us. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2651.0s)]
*  Because otherwise there's no clear way forward on the policy. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2653.16s)]
*  Yeah, I was gonna say, how do you think this [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2657.08s)]
*  has affected policy so far as you've been observing [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2659.24s)]
*  this round of violence? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2662.52s)]
*  Well, I mean, there's the US question [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2665.7599999999998s)]
*  and then there's a question in other parts of the world [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2667.9599999999996s)]
*  and certainly in Israel. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2670.3199999999997s)]
*  And I would just observe here that for the people [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2671.3999999999996s)]
*  who are closest to the decision-making [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2674.68s)]
*  and they are in a really, really difficult place [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2676.92s)]
*  because they recognize the US has long-term interests [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2680.32s)]
*  and reasons to be involved in supporting Israel. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2683.7200000000003s)]
*  But at the same time, there's grave concern. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2686.2000000000003s)]
*  And I see this from the Biden administration [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2688.12s)]
*  about the Palestinian lives are being lost [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2691.08s)]
*  and how to sort of put Israel in a position [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2693.4s)]
*  to defend its interests, defend its security, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2695.2000000000003s)]
*  but limit the loss of civilian life [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2697.48s)]
*  that raises the deepest legal and ethical questions. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2699.08s)]
*  And that I think is a project that is benefited [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2702.36s)]
*  by broader discourse in society [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2707.56s)]
*  where people can talk to each other [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2710.6s)]
*  and listen to opposing points of view. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2711.96s)]
*  And I think the narrowing of that space [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2713.76s)]
*  has left the administration with a much bigger challenge [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2716.28s)]
*  trying to understand how it's trying to thread the needle [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2719.6400000000003s)]
*  and strike that balance. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2721.84s)]
*  Yeah, and it looks like we've, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2723.6400000000003s)]
*  while we're waiting for questions, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2726.48s)]
*  it looks like we've lost Yael, but Suha, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2727.8s)]
*  that what you talked about, it's incredibly striking, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2731.08s)]
*  that under, hi, Yael, she's back. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2735.64s)]
*  Hi, yeah. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2738.36s)]
*  But I was asking Suha, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2741.72s)]
*  often you hear the Israeli government push back [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2747.7999999999997s)]
*  on claims of apartheid and that they're not democratic [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2752.4s)]
*  by saying like, well, look, [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2757.88s)]
*  we have this large Arab Palestinian population, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2759.1600000000003s)]
*  one fifth of our country is not Jewish, [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2763.8s)]
*  and they have full rights. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2767.04s)]
*  And they can do what, they live just like Israelis do. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2768.88s)]
*  And Suha, what you're saying is under the cover of war, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2772.7200000000003s)]
*  a lot of that space is being shut down, [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2777.0s)]
*  particularly for the Palestinian population of Israel. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2779.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's a statement that I need to invite you to talk. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2787.6s)]
*  It was a question or a statement? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2791.2400000000002s)]
*  Both, I just wanted for you to respond to that. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2794.4s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2800.6s)]
*  First of all, yes, absolutely. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2801.96s)]
*  We are considered since the, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2805.4s)]
*  I'm just gonna start about the Jewish nation state law, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2810.12s)]
*  that we are now like second class citizens. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2813.84s)]
*  And we, as a Palestinian community, we really fight- [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2818.6000000000004s)]
*  Can you explain that law for people [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2823.1200000000003s)]
*  who don't know what it is in the audience? [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2825.8s)]
*  Yeah, so the Jewish nation state law, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2827.4s)]
*  and you can, Yael, help me with that, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2830.84s)]
*  was passed in 2018, if I'm not mistaken, right? [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2834.0s)]
*  And this give self-determination for the Jewish people [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2837.56s)]
*  and not for the Palestinian people. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2840.8s)]
*  And downgrade, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2844.2000000000003s)]
*  one of the articles is downgrading the language, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2849.2000000000003s)]
*  the Arabic language in Israel. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2853.96s)]
*  But most importantly is that the only self-determination [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2857.1200000000003s)]
*  is for the Jewish people and not for the Palestinian people. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2863.6800000000003s)]
*  So, and if you would like to appeal, [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2871.6400000000003s)]
*  some of the people were, or some of the groups, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2876.76s)]
*  especially Jewish from Arab countries, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2879.1200000000003s)]
*  appealed to the Supreme Court against this law [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2882.52s)]
*  and it was denied. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2885.32s)]
*  And since this law and the Israeli political atmosphere [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2888.92s)]
*  is going to the right side, ultra right wing, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2893.92s)]
*  and now we are facing this very settler government [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2899.2000000000003s)]
*  with the coalition that is around Netanyahu's government. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2904.44s)]
*  And before the 7th of October, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2911.12s)]
*  there were a lot of policies that Ben-Gvir and Mnuchin [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2914.12s)]
*  and Netanyahu itself, as part of the judicial coup as well, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2919.16s)]
*  is trying to pass against the Palestinian community [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2924.68s)]
*  in order to silence us, in order to shrink spaces, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2927.88s)]
*  as well as in order to cut funds and allocate funds [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2931.88s)]
*  to the Arab community inside Israel. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2936.2s)]
*  So it has been a systematic discrimination [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2938.6s)]
*  through the years, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2942.48s)]
*  and it's been a very difficult time [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2943.96s)]
*  for us to have systematic discrimination through the years. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2946.32s)]
*  But after 7th of October, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2949.6800000000003s)]
*  it's been really silencing us in terms of terrorizing us. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2952.36s)]
*  There's a lot of fear, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2960.48s)]
*  Yael said, no one can, we have no, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2962.0800000000004s)]
*  we don't use the social media platform anymore, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2966.0800000000004s)]
*  because we are afraid if we follow any organization [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2970.36s)]
*  for instance, any human rights organization, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2975.4s)]
*  and people will follow them, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2979.04s)]
*  they will be called for investigation [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2980.52s)]
*  why we are following this website or this Facebook of them. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2983.08s)]
*  If we put like on something, they will translated [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2987.52s)]
*  that we support Hamas and we support terrorism. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2993.52s)]
*  It's been really, I don't know how to, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=2997.36s)]
*  what the word that can I use? [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3001.84s)]
*  It's been a madness here, like we are citizens, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3005.28s)]
*  we did not from 48, we had only using, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3008.76s)]
*  peaceful demonstrations, peaceful protests, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3015.92s)]
*  we didn't use any armed or weapons [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3019.44s)]
*  if we would like to speak out, it's only by the law. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3024.6400000000003s)]
*  And now they are accusing us, accusing our young people, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3028.76s)]
*  students of supporting terrorism. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3032.48s)]
*  This is something that haven't experienced before. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3036.0s)]
*  And yes, this government is trying still [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3041.88s)]
*  to pass a very dangerous policies, [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3046.1200000000003s)]
*  especially against the Arab community. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3053.6800000000003s)]
*  But I think, and I can also elaborate here [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3055.76s)]
*  against the left side or the progressive Jewish [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3060.28s)]
*  that is trying now, by the way, [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3063.6800000000003s)]
*  there were silence from 7th of October, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3065.96s)]
*  but now like in the last few weeks, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3068.48s)]
*  we can hear Jewish Israelis progressive [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3071.32s)]
*  that they are trying to talk and have these efforts [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3076.2400000000002s)]
*  with the Palestinian community inside Israel [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3080.92s)]
*  in terms of activists and also political leaders [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3083.36s)]
*  in order to bring our voices together against the war. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3086.36s)]
*  So hopefully that we together can take a role, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3092.48s)]
*  a significant role in order to stop this war, [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3098.52s)]
*  to stop this madness, because otherwise nobody, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3102.76s)]
*  everybody knows that military actions can have specific [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3106.48s)]
*  or military actions have a very impact or dangerous impact, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3112.04s)]
*  but they do not shape the political atmosphere [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3119.08s)]
*  that it should be, especially in this area. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3125.16s)]
*  One last sentence I would like to add, unfortunately, [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3128.88s)]
*  there's a lot of bad things is happening, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3133.28s)]
*  but if we look about a positive, [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3136.16s)]
*  something that happened since this war and the attack, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3139.72s)]
*  the brutal attack on 7th of October on the civilians, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3143.44s)]
*  Israeli civilians, and we as a Palestinian community [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3146.3999999999996s)]
*  do not accept any attack on civilians. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3150.24s)]
*  It doesn't matter if it's a Jew, [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3154.7599999999998s)]
*  Druze or a Muslim or Palestinians, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3156.2s)]
*  the international community has more attention [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3160.9199999999996s)]
*  of what is going on with the Palestinian, [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3164.8399999999997s)]
*  the Palestinian case and has more attention [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3168.4s)]
*  with what is happening inside of Israel. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3171.96s)]
*  And this is something that we as the advocacy centers, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3174.64s)]
*  as people that are dealing with organizations [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3179.2s)]
*  and with policies and communicate with Congress members [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3183.7999999999997s)]
*  and even parliament members should be elaborate this issue. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3187.92s)]
*  Hopefully that we can have really bring all parties [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3193.88s)]
*  for really a real peace talk [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3199.96s)]
*  and not ignore the Palestinian case. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3203.92s)]
*  Speaking of peace talks, I know, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3207.36s)]
*  Julia, you're probably gonna ask us [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3209.2000000000003s)]
*  about the audience question [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3210.52s)]
*  on what the US government can do. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3211.56s)]
*  I just wanted to briefly call out the work [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3214.76s)]
*  that is being done by Bill Burns and by the US government [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3217.12s)]
*  to try to get hostages home [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3219.6800000000003s)]
*  and try to increase the pause in the hostilities [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3222.48s)]
*  because that does save lives [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3224.64s)]
*  and nobody benefits from what's happening to these hostages. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3227.76s)]
*  I would just note that [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3231.2400000000002s)]
*  and as far as concerned American citizens, [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3232.08s)]
*  to my mind, many of the ideas that have been before us [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3234.44s)]
*  in the last few minutes have been really about [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3241.2400000000002s)]
*  the importance of holding different, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3243.2000000000003s)]
*  seemingly opposing notions at the same time [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3245.1600000000003s)]
*  about how tragic it absolutely is [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3248.6s)]
*  to see the loss of life in Gaza among civilians [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3251.04s)]
*  but at the same time how we ought to be very honest [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3254.48s)]
*  about how horrific the situation was on October 7th [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3258.08s)]
*  and the aftermath of that. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3261.2s)]
*  To the extent that citizens can keep the ability [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3262.72s)]
*  to listen to respectfully expressed ideas [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3266.2s)]
*  that they do not agree with, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3269.6s)]
*  that is how we're gonna get to a better place [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3271.16s)]
*  and it's gonna take some time [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3272.7599999999998s)]
*  but it's gonna require effort and determination [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3274.12s)]
*  at the individual level. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3276.8s)]
*  I wanted to ask that of the other panelists. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3279.24s)]
*  The audience question was what you think the best roles are [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3281.92s)]
*  for one, the US government, two, concerned US citizens [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3285.36s)]
*  and three, foundations and philanthropy [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3289.6s)]
*  and the violence and to start [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3293.96s)]
*  a real meaningful peace process. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3296.12s)]
*  Yael, you wanted to say something. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3299.2s)]
*  Wow, I have a few hats here. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3302.64s)]
*  I'm gonna shout out to Land For All. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3305.36s)]
*  Look it up, look up the Land For All initiative. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3307.52s)]
*  I think that the most important thing is, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3313.04s)]
*  first of all, it is if we're talking about dialogue. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3315.92s)]
*  So already begin by asking yourself [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3319.48s)]
*  what you're listening to. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3323.44s)]
*  Is the intention behind it to advance peace, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3325.16s)]
*  de-escalation and save lives in the long term [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3328.4s)]
*  or is it aimed at more conflict and legitimizing killing? [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3333.08s)]
*  And if it's two, then don't say it [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3338.28s)]
*  or pay less attention to people saying it. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3342.44s)]
*  There have been such incredible responsible people. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3345.4s)]
*  I think both in Israel and Palestine [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3353.92s)]
*  across all the different spaces [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3358.08s)]
*  that under very difficult conditions [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3361.4s)]
*  are trying to keep things together. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3365.92s)]
*  There are forces that are trying to escalate [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3368.32s)]
*  and do harm the extremists, fundamentalist forces [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3373.64s)]
*  and against those forces that have already done [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3378.96s)]
*  such horrific harm in front of that, kind of holding on. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3384.0s)]
*  And when we talk about voices, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3389.0s)]
*  it's not necessarily what's loud or quiet, right? [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3390.92s)]
*  It's about what people are saying. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3394.6s)]
*  Is it life-giving? [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3396.44s)]
*  Is it life-giving? [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3398.12s)]
*  Can it promote shared life? [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3399.44s)]
*  Because none of us are going anywhere. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3401.4s)]
*  Nobody is going anywhere. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3403.7999999999997s)]
*  And as soon as everyone can feel that and sense that [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3407.56s)]
*  and acknowledge that, this is a very important part of it. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3411.48s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3417.2799999999997s)]
*  When people are crying, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3418.12s)]
*  now goodbye, you have to counteract it [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3419.16s)]
*  and say, this thing is not happening no matter what. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3421.4s)]
*  And when people are saying, go back to Europe, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3425.28s)]
*  you stand there and counteract that. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3428.84s)]
*  And you say, nobody is going nowhere. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3431.6s)]
*  And I think that kind of holding on [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3433.96s)]
*  and working with the people that can make life happen. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3438.28s)]
*  And there are so many here. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3442.1600000000003s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3444.2000000000003s)]
*  You don't hear them. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3445.12s)]
*  You don't listen to them, but they're here. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3446.56s)]
*  And there is life-giving forces. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3448.68s)]
*  And I think those are the forces that need to be supported. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3451.3999999999996s)]
*  And listening to them and growing them and helping them [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3456.04s)]
*  is something that can really, really make a difference. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3459.24s)]
*  Well, I can't think of a better note to end this panel on [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3462.8399999999997s)]
*  than, yeah, Ella, in your words, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3466.16s)]
*  to remind everyone to focus on what is life-giving, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3468.9199999999996s)]
*  life-saving and really grateful even when we disagree. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3473.96s)]
*  Thank you so much to our panelists. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7f6WHdiyE&t=3478.96s)]
