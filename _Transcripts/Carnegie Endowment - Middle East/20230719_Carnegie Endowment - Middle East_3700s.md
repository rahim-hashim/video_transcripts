Video Description: For almost a quarter century, a "two-state solution" has been at the center of international policy toward Israel and Palestine. Realities on the ground, however, seem to be moving in the opposite direction. The number of two-state diplomacy critics has grown not only in Israel and Palestine but increasingly in Washington as well. Is the two-state solution still the most appropriate basis for policy, or are new approaches needed that react to what some are calling an unjust but persistent one-state reality?

# One State Reality vs Two State Solution
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [July 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM)
*  Thank you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=29.48s)]
*  Good afternoon, everyone. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=30.48s)]
*  My name is Marwan Masher. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=32.64s)]
*  I'm the Vice President for Studies at the Carnegie Endowment Supervising the Middle East [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=33.64s)]
*  Program. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=39.32s)]
*  Today, we have a very interesting session on the one state reality versus a two state [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=40.32s)]
*  solution in Israel and Palestine. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=45.92s)]
*  For almost a quarter century, the two state solution has been at the center of international [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=49.24s)]
*  policy towards Israel and Palestine. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=55.08s)]
*  But realities on the ground today seem to suggest otherwise. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=57.52s)]
*  There has not been a political process of negotiations for the last nine or ten years. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=61.56s)]
*  Demographically, we have 750,000 settlers in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, suggesting [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=67.92s)]
*  that the separation of the two communities has become difficult, if not impossible. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=75.36s)]
*  And today, many scholars are arguing that the two state solution is no longer possible [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=81.60000000000001s)]
*  and that we are in a one state reality, even if this reality is not a democratic one. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=90.28s)]
*  So are new approaches necessary? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  Should one stick to the two state solution or are there new approaches to solving this [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=102.04s)]
*  elusive problem and conflict? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=109.04s)]
*  To discuss this issue, we have today with us four distinguished speakers. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  Nathan Brown is a professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=118.64s)]
*  University, is the co-author of a recent book called The One State Reality as well as a [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=123.36000000000001s)]
*  recent piece in foreign affairs arguing the same. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=129.56s)]
*  Diana Buto is a Palestine-based lawyer and analyst. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=135.04s)]
*  She's a frequent commentator on Palestine and a former legal advisor to the Palestinian [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=139.04s)]
*  negotiations team. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=145.2s)]
*  Lucy Kirser Ellenbogen is the director of the Israel-Palestinian territories and the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=147.56s)]
*  region program at the US Institute of Peace. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=152.56s)]
*  And Michael Koppelho is the chief policy officer of the Israeli Policy Forum and a research [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=156.56s)]
*  fellow at the Shalom Hartman Institute of North America. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=162.48s)]
*  So with that introduction, I want to start with you, Nathan. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=167.28s)]
*  Nathan, can you lay out what you and your co-authors argued with in your both recent [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=171.8s)]
*  book and recent foreign affairs piece? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=177.8s)]
*  And why did you all decide to write it at this moment? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=180.16s)]
*  And perhaps in the process talk about some of the reactions to your piece, because I [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=184.24s)]
*  know there have been many. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=191.0s)]
*  Thank you very much, Marwan. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=192.0s)]
*  Essentially, the argument of the piece, I think, sort of three parts. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=194.0s)]
*  Number one, there is simply one state reality. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  There is a state of Israel that controls all the territory of mandatory Palestine. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=202.96s)]
*  And second, that the two-state solution, the two-state outcome to resolve the national [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=208.60000000000002s)]
*  conflict between Israelis and Palestinians was viable at an earlier point. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=214.32000000000002s)]
*  And one of the authors were against the two states in principle, but it's simply not viable [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=220.28s)]
*  now. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=224.88s)]
*  And even more than that, talk about it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=225.88s)]
*  And focusing on the two-state solution is actually damaging because it distracts from [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=228.88s)]
*  what's really happening on the ground. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=234.68s)]
*  And then there were some policy implications we were trying to draw out. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=236.68s)]
*  This is a reality. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=242.68s)]
*  The one-state reality is not a solution. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=244.68s)]
*  It's not a just outcome. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=246.68s)]
*  So we talk about how it was in the international community, the United States should deal with [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=248.68s)]
*  an emerging, deeply unjust and problematic reality. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=252.68s)]
*  So the four authors are different, but we agreed on every word and every sentence in [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=258.68s)]
*  the article. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=264.68s)]
*  And essentially, the reactions are kind of interesting. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=265.68s)]
*  I think sort of there's quiet reactions that we get in personal conversations, sometimes [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=271.68s)]
*  in quieter public events, and that is you're right, especially on the first. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=276.68s)]
*  There's a one-state reality. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=280.68s)]
*  There's not a lot of contestation about that. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=282.68s)]
*  But we do get some sharp reactions. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=285.68s)]
*  And I'm trying to understand the reasons for this because in a sense, what we're saying [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=288.68s)]
*  is what lots of people have been saying, including some of us, the authors, for a long [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=293.68s)]
*  time. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=298.68s)]
*  So why does this provoke such a strong reaction? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=299.68s)]
*  And quite honestly, I may sound a little cynical here. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=302.68s)]
*  It's not because we're brilliant or we're in front of everybody else. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=305.68s)]
*  In some ways, we're behind other people. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=308.68s)]
*  But you've got, you know, four middle-aged nerdy guys saying this in Foreign Affairs [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=310.68s)]
*  Astagio publication. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=316.68s)]
*  That's what gets attention. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=317.68s)]
*  So it's almost the fact that it is becoming boring, a boring truism. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=319.68s)]
*  And the policy implications of that are disturbing for all kinds of reasons. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=325.68s)]
*  And I think that's one reason we get the sharp reaction. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=333.68s)]
*  Interestingly, most of those reactions don't focus on the analysis, the analytical [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=336.68s)]
*  realities. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=342.68s)]
*  They focus on the prescriptions. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=343.68s)]
*  And sometimes, and I'll be frank here, it's a little bit distressing. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=345.68s)]
*  Sometimes they focus on the person. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=348.68s)]
*  They're sort of, you know, what are your real motives? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=350.68s)]
*  Why are you doing this? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=352.68s)]
*  What you're really trying to do is this, that you're really trying to destroy Israel. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=353.68s)]
*  You're trying to do this or that or the other thing. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=356.68s)]
*  So those have been some of the reactions. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=359.68s)]
*  But I want to go back to that quiet one. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=361.68s)]
*  We have a phrase in the article. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=363.68s)]
*  I don't remember which of the four co-authors came up with it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=365.68s)]
*  From the unspeakable to the undeniable. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=368.68s)]
*  And I think that's where we are with the one state reality. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=370.68s)]
*  What was something that everybody knew, including policymakers, but didn't want to [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=373.68s)]
*  say is now kind of the beginning point for discussions. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=379.68s)]
*  It's become the received wisdom. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=383.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=385.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=387.68s)]
*  Perhaps we will listen to a different point of view from Michael. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=388.68s)]
*  Michael, more than 10 years ago, in 2012, two of the main architects of the Oslo peace [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=393.68s)]
*  process called the Two-State Solution and the Oslo Framework Dead. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=400.68s)]
*  So Ahmed Correa and Josie Velen, two main architects of the Oslo process, both felt [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=404.68s)]
*  that 10 years ago or more than 10 years ago that the process is dead. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=413.68s)]
*  You recently were, sorry, that the Two-State Solution is dead. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=418.68s)]
*  You recently wrote that you have little dispute with the description of the situation as it [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=422.68s)]
*  exists. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=427.68s)]
*  Your disagreement is with the prescription which you believe in for citizenship for all [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=428.68s)]
*  Israelis and Palestinians in a single state. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=435.68s)]
*  Many of the architects of the peace process, including Josie Velen and Ahmed Correa, came [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=440.68s)]
*  to believe that this had run its course. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=445.68s)]
*  If there is no viable process that can produce a Two-State Solution, why should it be a goal [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=447.68s)]
*  anymore? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=458.68s)]
*  Thanks, Marwan. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=460.68s)]
*  So as you point out, I think that Nathan is 100% correct in describing the current situation [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=463.68s)]
*  on the ground in Israel-Palestine. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=470.68s)]
*  There is no question to me that at the moment Israel controls all of Israel inside the Green [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=474.68s)]
*  Line and the West Bank thoroughly. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=480.68s)]
*  And to talk about Palestinian authority, autonomy, or sovereignty, I think is incorrect. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=484.68s)]
*  There is certainly limited PA autonomy, but even in those spots it is routinely violated. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=490.68s)]
*  So talking about a one-state reality to me is not and should not in any way be controversial, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=497.68s)]
*  nor is it wrong. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=504.68s)]
*  Where I differ is that, and I may be the last one to leave the room here, but where I differ [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=506.68s)]
*  is that I don't think that two states is no longer viable. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=513.6800000000001s)]
*  I think that we are in likely the darkest period that we have been in regards to this. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=517.68s)]
*  Some of that is the current Israeli government, which is doing things that are literally unprecedented [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=524.68s)]
*  when it comes to the situation in the West Bank. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=530.68s)]
*  But it is certainly not all because of the current Israeli government. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=533.68s)]
*  I think that when anyone was saying 10 years ago that two states was difficult to envision, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=536.68s)]
*  it was because of policies of successive Israeli governments, all of whom, including ones from the left, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=544.68s)]
*  built inside the West Bank, did what they could to erode the Palestinian authority, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=550.68s)]
*  did what they could to ensure the current one-state reality that we see. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=555.68s)]
*  But from my point of view, when you look at the numbers and when you look at where there are Israelis [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=561.68s)]
*  inside of the West Bank, there is still a way to get separation and get to two states. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=568.68s)]
*  When there are about 100,000 Israelis living over the Green Line, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=573.68s)]
*  roughly 79% are on about 3.9% of the territory that's all attached to the Green Line. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=578.68s)]
*  That still lives a lot of Israelis who are living deep into the West Bank, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=585.68s)]
*  in very small settlements, and those small settlements are growing in number, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=589.68s)]
*  particularly because the Israeli government is turning a blind eye to things like illegal outposts [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=594.68s)]
*  that are purposely being placed in spots deep inside the West Bank, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=599.68s)]
*  purposely being placed in spots that disrupt Palestinian continuity. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=603.68s)]
*  Those are things that are going to have to be dealt with, and I think that anybody who portrays that as an easy task [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=607.68s)]
*  is vastly underestimating what it's going to take to actually get to a two-state outcome. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=614.68s)]
*  But I don't think that we're at the point of no return, and I also worry when it comes to U.S. policy [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=621.68s)]
*  that if we shift and we start not only acknowledging the current one-state reality, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=628.68s)]
*  but dropping any pretense to trying to get to separation and to two states, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=635.68s)]
*  we're going to end up with a situation that is in some ways going to be worse than what we have now. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=641.68s)]
*  If there's anything of which I'm confident, and I spend lots of time talking to Israelis, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=648.68s)]
*  and I spend lots of time in Israel, it is that Israelis are not going to give up Israel as a Jewish state. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=653.68s)]
*  And I worry that if we shift to a policy of one state, it's going to lead to ultimately more bloodshed. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=660.68s)]
*  It's going to lead to things that are even uglier than what we see on the ground now. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=672.68s)]
*  And at the end of that process, we may end up back where we are trying to separate the two sides. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=677.68s)]
*  And so I prefer to do what we can, and I'm sure at some point we'll talk about what that might be. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=683.68s)]
*  I prefer to do what we can to try to get two states back on track, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=688.68s)]
*  certainly to take a tougher line with the Israeli government, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=694.68s)]
*  do what we can to stop the situation that has created this one-state reality, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=698.68s)]
*  and figure out if two states is still salutable, which, as I said, from my perspective, it still is, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=704.68s)]
*  but it's certainly not going to be forever. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=709.68s)]
*  Okay, moving to Diana. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=713.68s)]
*  When Oslo was signed, Diana, and linking in what Michael just said, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=716.68s)]
*  the number of settlers in the West Bank and East Jerusalem was around 250,000. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=721.68s)]
*  30 years later, they are around 750,000. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=727.68s)]
*  So the numbers are daunting. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=731.68s)]
*  Michael still believes we can separate the two communities. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=733.68s)]
*  Many argue that we cannot. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=738.68s)]
*  You have been an early critic of Oslo and the two-state solution [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=740.68s)]
*  after having spent a good part of your career engaged in Palestinian-Israeli negotiators as a legal advisor. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=744.68s)]
*  You're probably in the same position I was with the Jordanian government. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=752.68s)]
*  So when was the moment you came to feel not only that the exercise was going nowhere, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=757.68s)]
*  but that it was important to say so publicly? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=763.68s)]
*  And why do you think policymakers are refusing to think beyond the two-state solution? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=767.68s)]
*  Thank you, Matwan. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=774.68s)]
*  Thank you for hosting this, and thank you, Nathan, for the excellent piece that you've written, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=775.68s)]
*  and I want to thank all the panelists for being here today as well. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=780.68s)]
*  Oh, when did I have the about face? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=785.68s)]
*  Look, I had two different, there were two different moments in time for me where I saw what the reality on the ground was [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=789.68s)]
*  and how much that differed from the political speak, so to speak. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=799.68s)]
*  One time was in the early 90s. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=805.68s)]
*  Immediately after the signing of Oslo, I was very much like Michael, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=809.68s)]
*  where I believed that it was just a question of getting the right agreement [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=814.68s)]
*  and that we just needed to sign this right agreement to get the settlers out, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=819.68s)]
*  and there would be an agreement, there would be a peace agreement. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=826.68s)]
*  So my first inclination was very unfortunately, and I say this with all humility, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=831.68s)]
*  that I was somebody who didn't agree with Edward Said. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=839.68s)]
*  I thought that Edward Said was, I arrogantly thought that Edward Said was somebody who was wrong, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=843.68s)]
*  and it was really in the 90s, in the late 90s that I began to see that he was right. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=849.68s)]
*  But the real test for me, the real moment of truth came during the negotiations at Taba, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=855.68s)]
*  when during the negotiations at Taba, the Israeli negotiators made clear [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=863.68s)]
*  that this was all about them rewarding Israel for very bad behavior, meaning all of the settlement construction, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=869.68s)]
*  and that Palestinians had to suck it up, so to speak. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=877.68s)]
*  And so that moment came a little bit later for me. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=882.68s)]
*  So between the late 90s and then at the end of the Taba agreement, there were a few years that happened. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=886.68s)]
*  But now when I look back, Marwan, and I look at what happened in Israeli history [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=892.68s)]
*  and what happened during the negotiations, during this peace process and so on, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=898.68s)]
*  I realize that the two-state solution was actually dead in 1967. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=903.68s)]
*  And I say this because there was political will to remove the settlers in 1967, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=908.68s)]
*  when the first settlements went up, and they, instead of using that political capital, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=915.68s)]
*  they ended up squandering it, and we now see a settler movement that is stronger than any movement we see inside Israel. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=921.68s)]
*  In fact, the settlement bloc is the largest bloc, it's the largest voting bloc that we now see within the government. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=929.68s)]
*  So if there was an opportunity, it died very quickly in 1967, and that opportunity has not existed. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=936.68s)]
*  Why is it that people keep clinging to it? This is the million-dollar question. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=943.68s)]
*  I think it's, I don't have the million-dollar answer, but I have a few things that I don't think of. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=947.68s)]
*  One is that we still have a Palestinian authority that flies around and pretends that it's president, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=953.68s)]
*  and for as long as he keeps calling himself president and keeps waving a flag, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=958.68s)]
*  the international community is going to continue to cling on to that. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=963.68s)]
*  But the moment that that stops, I think that we might see a change in policy. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=966.68s)]
*  Another reason is because it's in Israel's interest to continue to prop up the Palestinian authority. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=971.68s)]
*  They've said as much, they've done as much just this past week by saying that they don't want it to collapse. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=977.68s)]
*  And I think internationally, the world community doesn't want to expend any political capital [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=982.68s)]
*  when it comes to holding Israel to account. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=988.68s)]
*  So I think the reasons are many, but the tragedy is that we're at a point now where you, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=991.68s)]
*  as I've said before, and I said this many, many years ago, you can't unscramble an egg. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=998.68s)]
*  And instead of trying to think of ways of separation as people keep trying to do, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1003.68s)]
*  I think we really have to focus on ending this apartheid regime that exists from the river to the sea. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1010.68s)]
*  Okay. By the way, I want to remind people who want to ask questions to send their questions to the chat box. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1017.68s)]
*  And I hope we will have time to answer at least some of them. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1025.6799999999998s)]
*  So Lucy, Diana introduces a very radical idea that the two-state solution actually was dead in 67. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1029.6799999999998s)]
*  We didn't need to wait 40 years to declare its death. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1040.6799999999998s)]
*  You have been working at the US Institute of Peace, spending a large part of your career towards a two-state solution. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1045.68s)]
*  I did that as well. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1056.68s)]
*  Would recognizing a one-state reality necessitate an end to the kind of peace making work that you [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1058.68s)]
*  and most of the international community have been involved in? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1069.68s)]
*  How would our work have to change if we start operating under the assumption that the two-state solution now is inoperable [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1073.68s)]
*  and the reality on the ground needs to be addressed? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1083.68s)]
*  How would you answer that? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1086.68s)]
*  Thank you, Marwan, and also a word of thanks to you and to Carnegie for hosting and co-panelists for an interesting discussion [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1090.68s)]
*  and Nathan for generating with your co-authors this important discussion and debate. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1097.68s)]
*  I would just note maybe a slight modification to what you were saying, Marwan, is that certainly from a perspective of, say, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1102.68s)]
*  the US Institute of Peace, from a perspective of a quest for peace and conflict resolution, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1110.68s)]
*  the end goal is what would be a sustainable, peaceful resolution to the situation. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1116.68s)]
*  And I think there has been, as just discussed with Diana, there had been a consensus for a long time, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1122.68s)]
*  and not just in US policy circles, but I think internationally, and there was a point at which both parties brought in to this notion [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1128.68s)]
*  that the two-state solution would be the way to achieve that sustainable goal. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1136.68s)]
*  And I think I would just add on, I think Diana put out a number of reasons why it's the solution that won't die, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1141.68s)]
*  why it keeps capturing the imagination or sort of won't go away easily. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1149.68s)]
*  And I would suggest some of that is not just for the reasons that Diana mentioned. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1154.68s)]
*  I think there definitely are entrenched interests. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1159.68s)]
*  I think there have certainly been cynics who have used a process that has been implemented to try to get there [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1161.68s)]
*  as a get out of making tough compromises free card and pursuing maximalist goals. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1169.68s)]
*  But I also think it captured the imagination because I think even going back to the original petition plan, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1175.68s)]
*  there was a sense among many that having these two sizable populations trying to live in any other way, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1181.68s)]
*  who deeply, deeply dislike and distrust each other, trying to achieve a sustainable nonviolent solution [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1191.68s)]
*  without some form of separation in the form of two states, I think that was, it was just seen as no other possible route to or prescription for a sustainable peace. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1198.68s)]
*  And I think that you still see, so again, I think put aside the simple reasons for it, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1210.68s)]
*  I think that people are still having a hard time thinking about what the alternatives that say Nathan is laying out would be the alternatives, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1216.68s)]
*  how that's any more feasible at this point, as difficult as I think we all agree here today that getting to two states is. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1225.68s)]
*  I haven't yet heard an answer in this debate writ large, not just in this discussion of how we get to what would be a prescription for peace, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1232.68s)]
*  which I think the authors, I think Nathan, you and your co-authors laid out either in the original piece or the response, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1241.68s)]
*  that there's only two ways that you can think of to the way equality of rights for both would be achieved, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1247.68s)]
*  either two states or a bi-national equal rights state. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1254.68s)]
*  And to me, when I think of what the feasibility would be of one over the other, for many of the reasons laid out, I'm still stuck on that proposition. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1258.68s)]
*  What I would say is I do think that the onus now is on the parties to articulate in a fulsome way their endgame vision and not just the vision, right? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1267.68s)]
*  I think Diana just mentioned that Taniyahu has said in the last couple of weeks, we need to, you know, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1277.68s)]
*  we need to, you know, quash any aspiration for Palestinian state and we need to make sure that we crop up a strengthened or strengthened or emboldened Palestinian authority. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1283.68s)]
*  That certainly wouldn't embolden them or strengthen them with their own people. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1293.68s)]
*  But I think now the onus is on the parties to say, OK, what is your endgame vision of where that leads? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1296.68s)]
*  And what is your understanding of the consequences, tradeoffs and paths to getting there? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1302.68s)]
*  And I mean, consequence and tradeoffs for your own interests. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1307.68s)]
*  And I think that's what we're not seeing. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1310.68s)]
*  I think the parties being caught to account at this point, people, this term political horizon is used a lot. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1312.68s)]
*  Should we lost the political horizon? [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1318.68s)]
*  And I think at the end of the day, that is true. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1320.68s)]
*  I think we have the U.S. and other actors, including I don't want to talk about the Arab Peace Initiative with you, Hemawan, you know more than anyone. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1322.68s)]
*  But I have found it interesting that with this death, as it were, of the Arab Peace Initiative with the advent of the Abraham Accords, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1330.68s)]
*  I have not seen a death of the articulation of the goal in the Arab Peace Initiative. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1336.68s)]
*  I think those countries are still saying that two states is their goal for some of the reasons and many of the reasons we've just talked about. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1342.68s)]
*  But I think that we need to get to the point where we're not just saying what the political horizon is and not calling the parties to account, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1349.68s)]
*  to express why, if that's not their goal, what the alternative is and what that means for the future. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1357.68s)]
*  I want to come back to you, Nathan, building on what Lucy just said. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1367.68s)]
*  So Lucy says that all the alternatives are worse and there is no point in a bad alternative, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1373.68s)]
*  a binational state, a one-state solution that seems equally, if not more untenable. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1385.68s)]
*  Many people have, including yourself, called for equal civil and political rights and human rights for all in the areas under Israel's control, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1394.68s)]
*  regardless of the shape of the solution, whether it's one state or two states. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1409.68s)]
*  And I think many agree that the shape of the solution today is very difficult to imagine. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1415.68s)]
*  We have seen today, we witnessed a youth movement in the occupied territories that I have called a third intifada, but an intifada without leadership. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1422.68s)]
*  Every four or five people getting together and engaging in violent acts for no defined political end. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1437.68s)]
*  It's just a way of frustration of what is going on, and I'm afraid that might even increase in the future. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1449.68s)]
*  But most of those critical for this call for equal civil and human rights for all have seen this as a call to end Jewish self-determination. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1460.68s)]
*  Nothing is being said about Palestinian self-determination, of course, but that's how they've seen it. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1472.68s)]
*  Why do you think the peace is being read this way and what policy recommendations do you have for the U.S. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1479.68s)]
*  to get to equal rights for all, no matter what the shape of the solution is, whether it's one state or one state or two states? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1486.68s)]
*  That's a great question. I mean, I think we are read that way. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1494.68s)]
*  And I think we're read that way for a couple reasons, as essentially calling for a one state solution. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1501.68s)]
*  We have no objection to a one state solution. We have no objection to a two state solution. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1509.68s)]
*  But I think we're read that way in part because we're not offering a viable path. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1512.68s)]
*  I mean, in a sense, everything that Lucy just said about how to get to these various paths, that's what we're agreeing with. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1518.68s)]
*  So not being able to point to any kind of viable process that will lead to some kind of permanent resolution, peaceful resolution of this conflict. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1526.68s)]
*  We read that way. That's sort of a good faith reading of the article. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1538.68s)]
*  I honestly think there's a bad faith reason as well. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1543.68s)]
*  As I say, the policy implications of what we're saying are ones that people have tried not to deal with. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1546.68s)]
*  And so disqualify the messengers rather than message. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1552.68s)]
*  I think there is some of that going on in public discussion. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1555.68s)]
*  The quiet discussions that I mentioned are very, very different. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1562.68s)]
*  They're much more like the tone of the discussion that we're having right now. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1565.68s)]
*  And I'm very grateful to my co-panelists, actually, partly for that, for engaging with the serious issues. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1569.68s)]
*  In terms of policy recommendations, again, I don't disagree with anything that actually that anybody has said at this point, even though people who were disagreeing with me, I agree with. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1578.68s)]
*  Yeah, a two-state solution, Michael, I think is right, is it wouldn't be a perfect outcome, but it would be a possible one. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1590.68s)]
*  But I go back to Lucy's point about all roads. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1599.68s)]
*  I'm going to put it slightly more modally than she did. All roads are blocked. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1604.68s)]
*  So starting off by asking what is the ideal outcome and how do we get there is probably going to lead us to spinning or continuing to spin our wheels. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1609.68s)]
*  Let's start instead with realities on the ground and let's start instead with some kind of sense that everybody involved, all individuals and all peoples have rights and measure policy by that yardstick. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1620.68s)]
*  So this is not a solution, any permanent solution would have to respect those rights. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1635.68s)]
*  This is a yardstick by which to judge policies. Is it treating people? Is it improving the situation on the ground for real people, even short term? [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1640.68s)]
*  When you talk about a two-state solution, and as we have, the siege of Gaza, which has gone on now for just an inhumanely long period of time, kind of disappears into the background. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1649.68s)]
*  We'll deal with Gaza later. We'll negotiate two states and then we'll deal with Gaza. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1663.68s)]
*  Put that on the front burner. Address the ongoing humanitarian disaster in Gaza and start policy from there. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1669.68s)]
*  There are other implications, I think. One is, Diana used a very tough word, and it's a word I have trouble pronouncing, not because it's hard to say, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1681.68s)]
*  but for emotional reasons, she used the word apartheid. If you take this one state reality seriously, if you listen to the statements of current Israeli leaders, Prime Minister Netanyahu is on the left wing of his government, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1692.68s)]
*  and those who are on the right wing, they are talking about a situation that seems to me to qualify as apartheid. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1705.68s)]
*  And up till now, the response of the United States has been, well, with apartheid, no, we don't believe it's apartheid, but generally when you start talking about international legal instruments, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1713.68s)]
*  we talk about Geneva Conventions and so on, the idea has been, wait, that distracts from diplomacy. This has to take place in the realm of diplomacy. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1724.68s)]
*  And there is no diplomacy now. So stop doing that. Stop exempting this issue from all the international standards and structures that the United States helped construct after World War II of an international order that was respectful of human rights. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1732.68s)]
*  Stop saying Geneva Conventions are somehow not relevant to this. Those are the sorts of policy implications. And I would say based on what Lucy said, yeah, this is not going to lead to a solution anytime soon. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1753.68s)]
*  I don't think there will be a solution. I don't think I will live to see a solution. I'm just hoping my grandchildren will be, and the standard that I'm articulating is one that I hope would lead a future generation in a better position to negotiate a just and peaceful outcome. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1776.68s)]
*  So, Michael, Diana has used the word apartheid. It's a word that was taboo five years ago. It is no longer taboo. And a lot of people have used it, a lot of human rights organizations, including Bates and others. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1795.68s)]
*  But I want you to imagine a scenario in 2033, 10 years from now, when the possibility of a two-state solution, even then 10 years from now, I think you would argue is pretty remote. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1815.68s)]
*  There hasn't been a political process for the last 10 years. The number of Palestinian Arabs today in areas under Israel's control is slightly bigger than the number of Israeli Jews. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1829.68s)]
*  So we already have a situation in which a minority is ruling over a majority in, if I don't want to say apartheid manner, in less than a democratic way. And the issue of rights is becoming center stage now throughout the world. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1844.68s)]
*  How would you see the situation on the ground in Israel, Palestine 10 years from now? If a minority is ruling over a majority, if there is no two-state solution and no equal rights for Palestinians and Israelis, how would you describe the situation in Israel, Palestine? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1862.68s)]
*  How do you think the Jewish American community would react 10 years from now? We are already seeing polls that suggest that the American Jewish community prefer a democratic Israel to a Jewish Israel. How would you describe the situation in your view 10 years from now? [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1882.68s)]
*  So I don't have a crystal ball, so I don't know what will be 10 years from now, but I can certainly address the underlying issue. If Israel continues along the path that it is going on, it's hard for me to see Israel remaining democratic. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1902.68s)]
*  And one of the reasons why I think it's important for the United States to keep on focusing on two states is to keep Israel in a democratic camp. Nathan is correct in pointing out that Prime Minister Netanyahu is on the left of his coalition. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1920.68s)]
*  I would argue that he's been on the left of his coalition for almost a decade, but now it's even more stark. He, of course, himself has moved even farther to the right, but his partners have moved all that more to the right. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1940.68s)]
*  And my concern is that if the United States or other countries start talking about a single state, that is going to give fuel to the Israeli right to do things such as formally annexing the West Bank and not giving Palestinians their citizenship. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1955.68s)]
*  Because what they will say is, all right, the rest of the world is saying one state, so we're going to implement the one state. And I think that if we get to one state in Israel-Palestine, it's going to be the Israeli right-wing vision of one state. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1972.68s)]
*  That's not acceptable to me. It's certainly not acceptable to the overwhelming majority of American Jews. Marwan, you are correct in pointing out that American Jews support Israel as a democracy, first and foremost. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=1989.68s)]
*  And so we should be holding Israel's feet to the fire to uphold those commitments. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2003.68s)]
*  Yesterday there was a vote in the House where only nine people voted against the proposition that Israel is not a racist or apartheid state. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2011.68s)]
*  That's the state of affairs in U.S. politics. I think that it's unlikely that this U.S. government or any U.S. government is going to push for a version of one state in Israel-Palestine where everybody has complete citizenship. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2025.68s)]
*  And so I want to avoid a situation where we get to an Israeli right-wing version of one state and reorienting U.S. policy away from two states, I think, is going to lead to that very quickly. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2044.68s)]
*  The American Jewish community, I would argue, should be doing a better job of pushing both the U.S. government and the Israelis on getting to a situation where Palestinians can have their absolutely legitimate national aspirations respected, where Palestinians can have rights, where Palestinians are not living under occupation. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2057.68s)]
*  You know, Nathan listed a number of things with which I agree, and I don't think that they require a reorientation away from two states. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2078.68s)]
*  The Trump administration is the only administration since 1967 that did not use either an abstention or a positive vote for a UN Security Council resolution targeting Israel over its policies in the West Bank. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2086.68s)]
*  We don't have to reorient around one state to start changing our policy in the U.N. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2102.68s)]
*  I shouldn't say change, because again, the Trump administration is the only one that never used it. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2109.68s)]
*  I think that people underestimate the political benefits to not only Prime Minister Netanyahu, but to all sorts of other Israeli officials in visits here. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2113.68s)]
*  I will say that I am dismayed at the reporting that President Biden invited Prime Minister Netanyahu to meet somewhere in the United States. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2126.68s)]
*  I suspect it won't be an Oval Office meeting, but a meeting at the U.N. as well, I think, given everything going on, doesn't necessarily send the right signal right now. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2136.68s)]
*  And I would frankly extend that policy to other folks in the Israeli government as well who also have power over what takes place in the West Bank. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2146.68s)]
*  I think that there are ways in which the U.S. can be more effective in persuading the Israelis to shift course in the direction of two states. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2154.68s)]
*  That doesn't require necessarily upending where the U.S. wants to see things going. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2164.68s)]
*  So am I happy with what's going on now with U.S. policy, right? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2170.68s)]
*  I'm not. But I think that there's a way to shift those things and still keep a two-state framework. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2175.68s)]
*  When we talk about a one-state solution, not reality, but a solution, people assume that it's the liberal view of one state, which means one person, one vote formula, which of course is something that Israel will never forget. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2181.68s)]
*  But San Bahur and others remind me that this is not the only solution to one state. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2200.68s)]
*  There are many other solutions, a federal arrangement, a confederation, where each community gets equal rights within their own sort of entity and where they have common maybe foreign policy or security policy or what have you. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2209.68s)]
*  Diana, you have been engaged in a one-democratic state campaign. You call it the One Democratic State. You're a founding member of that. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2224.68s)]
*  Can you tell us more about your vision about one-state solutions? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2235.68s)]
*  Is it a solution that can meet the demands of both communities and achieve both Palestinian self-determination and Jewish self-determination? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2240.68s)]
*  What has the reception been like for it in Israel, where a majority of Palestinian citizens still say they support the two-state solution? [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2255.68s)]
*  Although you've been telling me that the situation is changing on the ground lately. So can you tell us more about such activities? [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2266.68s)]
*  Yes, I'm happy to. So I think it's important to step back a second and to ask ourselves why there isn't this two-state solution if there's such a desire for it. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2276.68s)]
*  And the reason is, is that if there was going to be a two-state solution, it would have happened by now. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2290.68s)]
*  If this was a question about drawing a line and drawing a boundary, a line or a boundary would have been drawn by now. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2297.68s)]
*  That would have happened decades ago. It would have happened during the period that I was involved in negotiations. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2304.68s)]
*  But that's not the issue. And it's important to highlight that that's not the issue. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2310.68s)]
*  The issues that Palestinians are focused on is the Nakba and the creation of the State of Israel on the backs of Palestinians on our land by expelling us, by ethnically cleansing us from our homeland. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2317.68s)]
*  And so it's only when you start looking at the issue from the perspective of the Nakba, from the people who have survived the Nakba, who have suffered from the Nakba, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2331.68s)]
*  that you can begin to understand any of these so-called solutions or any of the ways forward, because those are the people who must be centered. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2340.68s)]
*  It's those voices, those people who suffered, who must be centered in all of this. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2350.68s)]
*  And so talking about the One Democratic State campaign, the campaign takes off from a couple of standpoints. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2355.68s)]
*  And the first standpoint is that there are millions of Palestinians who are living under Israeli military occupation. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2364.68s)]
*  And the second standpoint is that there are close to two million Palestinians who are living under Israeli rule, but not as equal citizens. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2372.68s)]
*  I'm one of them. I hold Israeli citizenship, but I'm not an equal citizen. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2382.68s)]
*  The laws are not equally applied to me as they are to other Israeli citizens. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2386.68s)]
*  I'm discriminated against directly and indirectly in the form of law. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2391.68s)]
*  And the third is the issue of Palestinian refugees. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2396.68s)]
*  When you look at more than 50 percent of Palestinians live outside of the boundaries of historic Palestine, that's huge brain capital. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2400.68s)]
*  And so the One Democratic State is focused on bringing people back. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2412.68s)]
*  It's focused on writing the wrongs. It's focused on ending occupation and is focused on ending that system of discrimination and of privilege that exists from the river to the sea. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2418.68s)]
*  What has the reception been? It's been mixed. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2431.68s)]
*  Interestingly, the reception has been is mixed because mostly because especially in the West Bank, Palestinians are now at the point where they're saying to stay one state. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2435.68s)]
*  It's all sort of irrelevant at this point. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2448.68s)]
*  It's like you could be talking about living on the moon or reaching the moon sooner than you can talk or living on the rest sooner than you can talk about this idea of states. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2450.68s)]
*  And so for them, it's it's kind of the furthest thing that they're thinking about. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2461.68s)]
*  Instead, they're talking about the day to day. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2465.68s)]
*  How do we decolonize? How do we get these settlers out of our midst? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2468.68s)]
*  How do we get the army out of our way? [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2471.68s)]
*  How do we begin to live a normal life? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2474.68s)]
*  And so the reception has been mixed on the theoretical level. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2477.68s)]
*  Yes, people are supportive on both sides, by the way, of the green line, both among Israeli citizens and among Palestinians. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2481.68s)]
*  The problem is that there needs to be an entry point to get to that. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2489.68s)]
*  And all of this talk of two state, one state has been, I have to say, quite a distraction for Palestinians who are struggling on a daily basis just to be able to survive. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2493.68s)]
*  And they implore us all the time. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2505.68s)]
*  The people are imploring me say, let's focus on our actual reality. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2508.68s)]
*  What it's like to live as a Palestinian suffering under a brutal siege in Gaza. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2512.68s)]
*  What is what's it like to live as a Palestinian who's living behind the wall or living in a camp or living in the West Bank somewhere who doesn't have freedom of movement, doesn't have any prospects for a future. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2517.68s)]
*  Let's talk about what it's like to be a Palestinian who holds Israeli citizenship, who has laws that directly discriminate against them. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2529.68s)]
*  And so it's those elements that must be addressed rather than this theoretical framework that that quite frankly, the only people who are really talking about today are people in the United States. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2537.68s)]
*  And I just want to add one thing. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2551.68s)]
*  You know, the southern movement is not waiting for the United States to give it permission. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2553.68s)]
*  They never have. They never will. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2558.68s)]
*  They do what they do because they can. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2560.68s)]
*  And if anything, there should be the brakes that are put on this movement. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2562.68s)]
*  People truly believe in the idea of equality and of rights, whether it's in the framework of two states or in the framework of one state. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2566.68s)]
*  We've yet to see that anybody has put the brakes on Israel. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2574.68s)]
*  Instead, it's become very permissive. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2578.68s)]
*  Lucy, thank you, Diana. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2581.68s)]
*  That is bringing up an important point, which is that policymakers seem to be stuck with the shape of a solution. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2584.68s)]
*  While realities on the ground are different, people want, you know, to be treated equally. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2594.68s)]
*  They want their human rights to be respected. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2601.68s)]
*  They want to be able to live a normal life. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2604.68s)]
*  And this talk about, you know, the shape of a solution takes place in the international community in the absence of any real political process to make it happen. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2606.68s)]
*  So for the last 10 years, we have not had a political process while settlement activity has mushroomed, has increased, and the status quo has not been held static. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2619.68s)]
*  I often joke that it is similar to a situation where two people are arguing over a slice of pizza while one of them is eating it. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2630.68s)]
*  It just doesn't work anymore, a lot of critics say. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2640.68s)]
*  You guys are stuck in the past talking about a two-state solution framework when reality on the ground suggests differently. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2644.68s)]
*  Today, President Herzog of Israel, as we speak, is addressing a joint session of Congress. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2651.68s)]
*  What do you think President Biden will tell President Herzog? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2658.68s)]
*  Do you believe, Lucy, that there is any real opportunity of the United States taking a serious attempt again to move the peace process forward? [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2664.68s)]
*  Are they going to be stuck with the issue of two states? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2678.68s)]
*  Or is the president, you know, soon to have a major presidential campaign and this whole issue is, you know, just going to give him headaches that he does not need? [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2681.68s)]
*  What is the significance of President Herzog's visit and what do you think the U.S. will tell him? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2693.68s)]
*  Look, I think we've heard some of what Biden will be telling him. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2703.68s)]
*  I mean, we've heard President Biden be, in relative terms, vocal, primarily for a long time, vocal pushing back on the proposed judicial reforms. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2709.68s)]
*  And recently, you've heard more emphasis, in fact, I think Michael recently wrote about this, more emphasis from Biden on connecting the concern over the direction of Israeli democracy, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2723.68s)]
*  not just to the judicial reform, but also reflecting on what is happening in the West Bank with the extremists in Netanyahu's coalition, the unchecked settlement growth a march away from two states. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2734.68s)]
*  So you have heard Biden express those concerns, that pushback in public, and I'm sure that that is going to be the messaging again today. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2746.68s)]
*  You raised another point in there, Marwando, you raised another question of do we see this administration going back to a political process? [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2757.68s)]
*  And in some ways, I think you answered the question yourself. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2765.68s)]
*  I think there's a cost benefit calculation, not just on the part of the U.S. administration, but I think on other international actors that we've seen over the last few years. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2768.68s)]
*  I think there's a lot of distraction with other international issues, a lot of reprioritization, and a lot of that reprioritization has come not just from these other issues that are taking precedence, but a sense that no good can come of this, that negotiations aren't feasible at this point. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2777.68s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of discussion about this, and I think there's an assessment, I think you see this again by the U.S., the Europeans, and the Arab parties as well, that the leadership on both sides are not in a position to come to a negotiating table and forge a successful solution. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2797.68s)]
*  So I think you are not going to see, and yes, the political calendar also plays into that. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2812.68s)]
*  I think the Biden, if you think about Biden and a lot of the people rounding coming out of the administration, the Obama administration did try and got burned. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2819.68s)]
*  And the administration that tried, and if we recall, ended with Secretary Kerry at the time, sounding all sorts of warnings about what would happen and what the trajectory and the vision was if a solution wasn't achieved. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2834.68s)]
*  And I think the calculation of this administration has been there is not, this is an effort not worth pushing right now. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2847.68s)]
*  Also, because the leaders aren't in a position to do that. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2858.68s)]
*  But I'd like to get back to a point that Diana made in talking about one of the proposals she's been working on. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2861.68s)]
*  And what Diana's been pointing to really here is a civil society ground up conversation. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2868.68s)]
*  I said in my earlier comments that I think it's on the onus is on the parties to articulate what the vision is. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2873.68s)]
*  If it's no longer two states and their understanding of what trade-offs they are making for their own futures and articulating that vision. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2880.68s)]
*  And I recognize and express in that I think the implication was that that's the parties, the elites, the leaders. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2889.68s)]
*  But I think that this is a conversation for the publics to have as well. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2895.68s)]
*  If you look at polling and Israelis and Palestinians have been exhaustively polled at the younger generations, the visions are very much changing. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2899.68s)]
*  The views are very much different than the parents and grandparents generation. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2909.68s)]
*  We did a few years ago in 2020 in a partnership with the Alliance for Middle East Peace. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2912.68s)]
*  USIP polled youth 15 to 21 year olds, Israelis and Palestinians. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2919.68s)]
*  And the results were rather sobering. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2925.68s)]
*  We're actually we're we're doing around two of that just to see why things have moved since then. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2928.68s)]
*  But at this youngest age cohort, the rejection by both sides of the sense that the other side has any connection or legitimate historical connection to the land. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2934.68s)]
*  Majorities on both sides were sort of denying that about the other. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2946.68s)]
*  The picture about neither side believed certainly that two states was feasible anytime soon. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2950.68s)]
*  But there was also a sense on both sides to varying degrees that force was the only way that was going to force the other side to make a concession. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2956.68s)]
*  This is a this is a very sobering reality of this is where the attitudes are at the younger generation. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2963.68s)]
*  And I think deep conversations. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2969.68s)]
*  I think I think you're right. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2972.68s)]
*  I think Israelis and Palestinians, particularly younger generation, feel that all these policy conversations are so detached from what's actually happening in their reality on the ground. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2974.68s)]
*  And so I think there is an onus as well. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2983.68s)]
*  And that's the work of civil society. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2985.68s)]
*  And there are groups that are that are doing that kind of work, trying to have Israelis together in conversations with themselves, Palestinians in conversations with themselves and ideally eventually with each other. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=2987.68s)]
*  It may sound naive, particularly to bring together with each other. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3001.68s)]
*  But this is where this future vision is going to be articulated. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3005.68s)]
*  I noted there was a question, I think, from San Bahor about confederation. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3009.68s)]
*  This is another one of those ideas that's out there on the table. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3014.68s)]
*  Nathan knows this is something else we're looking at at USIP. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3018.68s)]
*  What does this idea of confederation mean? [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3022.68s)]
*  I mean, to my mind, I'm not sure how you get to a confederation without first confederating two states. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3026.68s)]
*  You need to have sort of two states willingly decide to enter into a confederation with each other. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3032.68s)]
*  But that willingness is going to come from some real hard questions being asked by the publics themselves, either pushing their leaders if their leaders aren't pushing them in that direction. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3037.68s)]
*  What does this future look like and what are you both willing to bear in relation to living with each other? [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3048.68s)]
*  I want to wrap up a set of questions which we have and ask you all to comment on them. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3056.68s)]
*  They're all important questions and they have to do with the democracy issue. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3063.68s)]
*  So people are saying, you know, how can we have a viable political process when we will argue we don't have a democratic Israel? [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3068.68s)]
*  Israel used to be a democracy for its Jewish citizens. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3077.68s)]
*  Now even that is not true anymore. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3080.68s)]
*  And when we don't have a democratic PA, the last time we had elections was in 2006 or 2007. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3084.68s)]
*  And the PA has practically lost all its legitimacy since then. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3092.68s)]
*  So how can we have a viable political process in the absence of these elements? [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3097.68s)]
*  And how can civil society that Lucy talked about, how can they play a bigger role when they are facing restrictions and smear campaigns in the US and abroad? [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3104.68s)]
*  How do you address the shrinking civil experience issue also? [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3118.68s)]
*  All and I'll invite maybe all of you to answer this question and any other comment you might have in the interest of time. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3123.68s)]
*  We have eight minutes left, so maybe we can devote two minutes to each of you. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3134.68s)]
*  Who wants to start? [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3141.68s)]
*  Michael, you want to go ahead? [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3146.68s)]
*  Sure, I'm happy to go ahead. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3148.68s)]
*  There's no question to me that we've been talking about obviously the problems on the Israeli side. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3151.68s)]
*  There of course is no question to me that there are deep problems on the Palestinian side as well. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3158.68s)]
*  And the Palestinian Authority frankly is one of them. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3163.68s)]
*  I think it is important for the United States to do what it can to strengthen the Palestinian Authority simply because it is the only element at the moment in the West Bank that has any semblance of functioning institutions. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3167.68s)]
*  And I think that if the PA were to collapse tomorrow, we would have anarchy and that would certainly not be a good situation for Palestinians living in the West Bank. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3180.68s)]
*  That said, the Palestinian Authority is not in any way democratic. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3190.68s)]
*  In my own conversations with PA officials, I tend to find that instead of elections, they talk about establishing legitimacy through PLO consensus. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3195.68s)]
*  And to me that doesn't fly and I don't think that flies for many Palestinians either. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3206.68s)]
*  I think that the PA absolutely should undertake a real series of reforms. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3211.68s)]
*  I think the Palestinians absolutely need to have elections. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3217.68s)]
*  Some of that is on Israel, but certainly not all of it is on Israel. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3220.68s)]
*  And I also think that without elections, it's going to be impossible to have a single Palestinian actor. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3225.68s)]
*  The problem of the split between Fatah and Hamas and the West Bank and Gaza is a real issue, not only for the lives of Palestinians, but for any type of coherent single policy. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3233.68s)]
*  And certainly for a single coherent Palestinian policy that's able to deal with Israel, the United States, and other international actors. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3247.68s)]
*  So I think that all of that has to happen. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3253.68s)]
*  And I think that if I were directing Israeli policy, I would be working to figure out how to have elections both in the West Bank and Gaza in a way that will produce some sort of unified actor. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3256.68s)]
*  And then whatever that actor, whoever and whatever that actor is, then every other outside player can formulate policies as they wish and deal with it how they wish. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3276.68s)]
*  But the situation as it stands now, where not only are Palestinians living under Israeli occupation, but they are also living with a deeply undemocratic and corrupt PA, that is not a long term solution for anything good. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3288.68s)]
*  Lucy? [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3303.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm just looking at the question I think you posed as well about shrinking civic space. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3304.68s)]
*  And I think that that is a challenge. It's a challenge on both sides. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3313.68s)]
*  I think that that is a challenge within the societies. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3317.68s)]
*  But I think that there is also still, there are civil society organizations who are still able to speak, who are still able to engage with each other on these questions. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3320.68s)]
*  Are there smear campaigns? [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3337.68s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3339.68s)]
*  I think that these conversations, these conversations of future looking conversations and the is what I call it the now what and what next. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3341.68s)]
*  I mean, I think that the question that if nothing else that Nathan and his co-authors article raised is a, as I understand the impetus behind it was the, this is the reality as it is. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3352.68s)]
*  Where do we go from here? [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3366.68s)]
*  And people may differ on the prescriptions, but the conversation is an important one to have. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3368.68s)]
*  And it's an important one for us to be having not just in Washington or in European capitals and elsewhere. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3374.68s)]
*  But it's important one for Israelis and Palestinians to be having between themselves and and and with each other. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3380.68s)]
*  And I think that that's that's an important place for us to be fosig and well, not just on this more detached policy conversation. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3388.68s)]
*  Diane. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3396.68s)]
*  Diane. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3401.68s)]
*  Look, I made my views on the Palestinian Authority very clear in the past. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3405.68s)]
*  I've written about that the policy authority should be folded. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3409.68s)]
*  I am a person who speaks very boldly about the Palestinian Authority, the need for for elections and so on. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3413.68s)]
*  That said, I think it's very important to keep something in mind. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3420.68s)]
*  It's Israel that's occupying the Palestinians, not the other way around. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3424.68s)]
*  And therefore, it's not that we need a Palestinian Authority to give Israel permission to end its occupation. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3428.68s)]
*  Israel can do that on its very own. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3434.68s)]
*  It doesn't need permission from anybody to do so. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3437.68s)]
*  It doesn't need a democratic organization, doesn't need elections. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3440.68s)]
*  It doesn't have the will. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3443.68s)]
*  And because it doesn't have the will, it looks to things like an undemocratic P.A. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3445.68s)]
*  and all of these sorts of things. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3450.68s)]
*  Do I believe that there should be democracy? [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3452.68s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3454.68s)]
*  Because I believe that the Palestinian Authority shouldn't be the service provider that it's been turned into, but should be instead a liberation movement, [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3455.68s)]
*  which is what other liberation movements around the world have done, which is liberate us, not liberate their people, not manage their people. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3463.68s)]
*  So I think we do a disservice when we're constantly focusing just on the P.A. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3471.68s)]
*  And I think we really have to refocus. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3476.68s)]
*  This is a question of Israel occupying Palestine, and it's Israel's job to end the occupation. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3479.68s)]
*  It's not the Palestinians' job to make themselves look better, to make Israel feel as though it can do it. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3486.68s)]
*  It's an obligation that it has. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3492.68s)]
*  It must do it. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3494.68s)]
*  And it's up to the world to, quite frankly, end this as well. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3495.68s)]
*  Nathan. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3499.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3500.68s)]
*  I said, in regard to our article, that nobody really disagreed with the analysis. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3502.68s)]
*  They disagreed with the prescriptions. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3507.68s)]
*  And this last round, I think everybody disagrees on the analysis, but comes up with the same prescription. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3509.68s)]
*  And that is essentially, I won't say for more democracy or for democracy per se, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3516.68s)]
*  but it's for democratic dialogue and democratic practice. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3525.68s)]
*  Let me just make a quick reference on the Palestinian side, because that's been the center of some of the discussion. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3529.68s)]
*  Yes, it's absolutely true that the P.A. is undemocratic. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3535.68s)]
*  I don't know how you build a democratic P.A. without having the right kind of political process and diplomatic process underlying it. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3540.68s)]
*  So it's a chicken and egg issue. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3548.68s)]
*  It's not going to happen. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3550.68s)]
*  There were Palestinian elections. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3551.68s)]
*  It wasn't just the Palestinian Authority, Palestinian leadership that canceled it. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3554.68s)]
*  There was very active and intensive and successful American intervention and intervention by other countries to ensure that those elections would not be repeated. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3558.68s)]
*  So there's lots of blame to go around. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3568.68s)]
*  Moving forward, I think what is important is not to expect some kind of democratic Palestinian entity to suddenly take shape and then negotiate with Israel [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3571.68s)]
*  or for suddenly a single state with democracy and full rights for all its inhabitants to suddenly emerge. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3585.68s)]
*  What is important is for those people who are trying to make policy to start from the position that everybody has a voice and everybody has rights. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3592.68s)]
*  And if policy is not starting from that basis, it's much more likely to simply more deeply entrench and institutionalize what is already a deeply problematic reality. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3600.68s)]
*  So democratic practice, democratic dialogue, greater space for discussion and debate by civil society actors, and perhaps elections might be a part of that. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3614.68s)]
*  But I'm talking really about a direction which politics has to take rather than any kind of sudden arriving at a democratic nirvana. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3629.68s)]
*  Thank you so much, all of you. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3637.68s)]
*  This has been a really rich discussion for those watching that have looked for definite answers to how to solve the conflict. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3639.68s)]
*  We obviously have not provided you with these. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3649.68s)]
*  I think what we have provided today is that the two-state solution is no longer the only paradigm to solve the Arab-Israeli conflict, perhaps not even the dominant one. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3652.68s)]
*  And I think Nathan summarized it best by saying that maybe it is time today to stop focusing on the shape of a solution, which remains elusive, [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3664.68s)]
*  and start focusing more on the rights of people, all people, Palestinians and Israelis, to have equal rights as the basis for any solution that might come about in the future. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3678.68s)]
*  Thank you very much for watching and to be continued. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOu5pUaj5zM&t=3690.68s)]
