# Iranâ€™s Cyber Threat
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [January 05, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0)
*  I think we'll get started. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you all for joining us. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1.72s)]
*  My name is Yegane Taurbati. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3.24s)]
*  I'm a reporter with Reuters. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4.48s)]
*  And we're here to present a report [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=6.4s)]
*  that Colin and Karim have written about the cyber threat posed [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=8.96s)]
*  by Iran. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=12.38s)]
*  Of course, when this event was planned a few weeks ago, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=13.68s)]
*  we were sort of in a different situation [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  in terms of what was happening domestically in Iran. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=18.96s)]
*  And so of course, we wanted to address what's [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=21.14s)]
*  happened in the last eight days or so. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=23.8s)]
*  So we are going to get to the reports. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=26.16s)]
*  And the so louder, sorry. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=27.88s)]
*  If they could turn up my mic a little bit. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=30.84s)]
*  I think it's on. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=35.24s)]
*  Can you hear me? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=36.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=37.64s)]
*  So we are going to get to the actual contents of the report [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=38.32s)]
*  and the really interesting findings that Colin and Karim [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=41.0s)]
*  have gathered over the last couple of years. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=43.84s)]
*  But first, we wanted to kind of start [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  by addressing what we've seen over the last eight days or so. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  So Karim, if you could just start off [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  by describing a little bit sort of how do you see this [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=53.5s)]
*  as different from 2009 and what are you observing? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=56.52s)]
*  So thank you all first for braving the cold. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  And hi to all of those who are watching online. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=61.68000000000001s)]
*  Just so we're all on the same page, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=66.04s)]
*  I would argue that there are three main distinctions [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  between today's protests and those of 2009. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=70.36s)]
*  Number one is scale. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=73.88s)]
*  Obviously, in 2009, you saw at one point [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=75.04s)]
*  two to three million people take to the streets at its largest. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=77.88s)]
*  There was protests of hundreds of thousands. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=81.04s)]
*  This scale has been quite a bit smaller. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=83.04s)]
*  The largest crowds I've seen this time around [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=85.96s)]
*  are perhaps tens of thousands of people. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  But what's much larger about these protests [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=91.28s)]
*  are the geographic scope. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=94.32s)]
*  In 2009, it was mostly the city of Tehran, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  some smaller protests, and city of Esfahan. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  But it was a lot of urban sophisticates. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=101.6s)]
*  This time around, there are perhaps dozens, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=104.24s)]
*  according to some estimates I've seen, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  up to 80 cities throughout Iran that are experiencing protests. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=110.0s)]
*  According to BBC Persia, 90% of these cities [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=115.16000000000001s)]
*  are essentially experiencing popular anti-government protests [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  for the first time since 1979. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=121.36s)]
*  So the geographic scope is much wider than it was in 1979. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=124.84s)]
*  And I would argue another distinction this time around [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=130.0s)]
*  are the intensity of the slogans. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  In 2009, people were calling for their vote back. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=134.84s)]
*  It was much more in the spirit of let's reform [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=138.0s)]
*  the Islamic Republic, at least initially. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=141.6s)]
*  And then it radicalized over time. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=143.4s)]
*  But this time around, you have people who are just [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  totally fed up with the entire system, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=149.28s)]
*  calling for deaths to the Supreme Leader, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=151.44000000000003s)]
*  or deaths to the Islamic Republic. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=153.88000000000002s)]
*  And I thought from the beginning, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  first of all, none of us predicted this would happen. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=158.68s)]
*  I say it's akin to predicting [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  anti-national, anti-Trump protests [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=164.12s)]
*  breaking out in Kentucky. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=166.68s)]
*  These cities were thought to be the strongholds [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=169.36s)]
*  of the Islamic Republic, cities like Qom and Mashhad. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=172.6s)]
*  So none of us predicted this would happen. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=176.44s)]
*  But when they did, I think myself, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  one of the lessons I learned from both the 2009 uprisings [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=185.32s)]
*  in Iran and the Arab uprisings is that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=189.0s)]
*  there are no shortcuts from authoritarianism to democracy. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=193.76s)]
*  There's infomercials for eight-minute abs, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=198.4s)]
*  but there's no such thing as eight-day democracy. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=200.96s)]
*  And this is a regime which [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=204.76000000000002s)]
*  remains firmly resolved to stay in power. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=208.72s)]
*  There's security forces, as far as we can tell, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=212.44s)]
*  from far away, are pretty cohesive. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=215.76000000000002s)]
*  One of the things I say about the Islamic Republic [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=219.4s)]
*  in contrast to the Shah's government, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=221.8s)]
*  the Shah's government, many of their political, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=223.64000000000001s)]
*  economic, military elite, they studied abroad [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=226.44s)]
*  or had foreign passports. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=229.56s)]
*  So when the going got tough in 1978, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=230.72s)]
*  they could make their lives outside of Iran. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=233.32s)]
*  The Islamic Republic's elite, military, political elite, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=235.64000000000001s)]
*  don't have that luxury, right? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=240.32s)]
*  There's few places which these folks can go. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  They don't speak foreign languages [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=245.0s)]
*  or have foreign passports. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=246.36s)]
*  And so I always thought for that reason, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=248.16s)]
*  this current leadership led by the Supreme Leader [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=250.76s)]
*  Ali Khamenei, they're willing to kill a lot of people, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=253.56s)]
*  to kill en masse, to stay in power. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=257.72s)]
*  But I don't think it's a society [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=261.12s)]
*  which is willing to die en masse to try to take power. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=262.72s)]
*  And so for that reason, I've always thought that the odds, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=266.28000000000003s)]
*  we can salute the courage of these protesters, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=269.8s)]
*  and we can, from a US perspective, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=274.32000000000005s)]
*  try to do everything in our power [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=278.12s)]
*  to inhibit the Islamic Republic's ability [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=279.72s)]
*  to black out communications and repress en masse. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=282.40000000000003s)]
*  But I always thought we needed to be sober [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=286.28s)]
*  about their prospects for success. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=288.23999999999995s)]
*  And so given the sort of repression of the protests [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=292.91999999999996s)]
*  that we've seen in the past eight days, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=297.35999999999996s)]
*  Colin, I was wondering, just to tie it into the subject [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=299.35999999999996s)]
*  of the report and the event today, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=302.0s)]
*  can you tell us what you've observed [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=304.32s)]
*  about what steps the government has taken [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  to limit communications, to slow down the internet, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  and whatever else you may have seen? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think one of the things that's interesting [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=314.24s)]
*  is that you've seen a sort of drastic [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=316.6s)]
*  and consequential reintroduction [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=320.2s)]
*  of the sorts of censorship that was common [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=323.68s)]
*  during the Ahmadinejad era. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=326.36s)]
*  And so what you saw, for example, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=328.48s)]
*  I think that the historical parallel [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=330.44s)]
*  is the 2013 presidential election. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=332.28000000000003s)]
*  In the lead up to the presidential election, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=335.64s)]
*  you saw a very aggressive blocking of circumvention tools, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=337.92s)]
*  tools that are used to bypass Iran's filtering regime. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=342.36s)]
*  You saw the targeting of dissidents with malware. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=345.44s)]
*  And eventually, actually, right after the official list [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=348.2s)]
*  of candidates was announced, up until the election, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=351.48s)]
*  you saw extremely aggressive throttling overall [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=354.4s)]
*  of bandwidth within the country. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=359.04s)]
*  Actually, after Rouhani was elected, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=361.64s)]
*  these sorts of tactics had generally subsided. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=363.88s)]
*  While there was still censorship of social networks [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=366.4s)]
*  and social media platforms, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=370.0s)]
*  there was sort of a sustaining of the status quo. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=372.28s)]
*  Things didn't get better, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=375.71999999999997s)]
*  but they didn't necessarily get worse. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=376.92s)]
*  In certain ways, overall internet speeds [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=378.92s)]
*  were slowly improved. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=383.15999999999997s)]
*  Access to 3G, 4G was introduced. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=385.12s)]
*  But you didn't see Twitter unblocked, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=388.64s)]
*  Facebook unblocked, and you saw the rise of Telegram [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=390.52s)]
*  as a service which ultimately eclipsed everything else [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=393.36s)]
*  and was not necessarily filtered. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=396.68s)]
*  In fact, you saw the Rouhani administration [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  would stake political capital on Telegram [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=401.40000000000003s)]
*  not being filtered and these services being available. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=404.96000000000004s)]
*  So, you know, the February 2016 parliamentary election, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=409.40000000000003s)]
*  there was a lot of pressure to censor. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=414.40000000000003s)]
*  And while there was a blocking of circumvention tools, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=417.28000000000003s)]
*  largely, the Rouhani administration was able [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=420.40000000000003s)]
*  to resist hardliners' calls for the blocking [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=423.40000000000003s)]
*  of Telegram and others. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=426.28000000000003s)]
*  What was really interesting [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=428.28s)]
*  is in the presidential election this year, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=429.52s)]
*  a number of the companies that provide circumvention tools [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=433.03999999999996s)]
*  were kind of in war rooms. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=436.23999999999995s)]
*  They had their back pocket mechanisms [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=438.2s)]
*  to evade any sort of thing [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=442.52s)]
*  the government would throw at them. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=444.79999999999995s)]
*  And what was surprising is nothing happens. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=447.47999999999996s)]
*  There was no filtering. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=450.0s)]
*  And it was largely, you know, things were left open. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=452.08s)]
*  And then suddenly, within the course of a couple days [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=456.56s)]
*  of these protests breaking out, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=459.64s)]
*  everything started to get shut down. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=461.64s)]
*  And there was no investment of political capital. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=464.08s)]
*  And so what you've seen at least is the blocking of Telegram [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=466.96s)]
*  which the Rouhani administration had resisted for four years. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=470.4s)]
*  And you saw the throttling of internet. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=474.64s)]
*  Now, it's really hard to understand. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=477.48s)]
*  Internet measurement is extremely difficult. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=480.4s)]
*  It's a science in and of itself. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=483.12s)]
*  The internet is a complex thing. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=485.8s)]
*  It's hard to understand the totality [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=487.12s)]
*  of what the government is potentially doing overall, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=489.2s)]
*  but especially for somebody who's in, for example, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=493.04s)]
*  rural Abbas. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=495.48s)]
*  So we have a lot of rumors [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=498.2s)]
*  and we have a lot of sort of statements [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=500.16s)]
*  that have been made that maybe the international internet [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=503.56s)]
*  has been slowed down [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=506.28000000000003s)]
*  whereas domestic access is the same as always. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=508.0s)]
*  We know that circumvention tools are blocked. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=511.8s)]
*  We know that certain social media platforms [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=514.2s)]
*  such as Telegram have been blocked. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=516.96s)]
*  And so we know that there's been a rampant [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=519.32s)]
*  and very aggressive increase of censorship. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=521.76s)]
*  We don't necessarily know, it's harder to know [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=524.8000000000001s)]
*  what the comparable change [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=527.76s)]
*  in the surveillance regime has been. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=530.2s)]
*  We don't know, for example, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=531.88s)]
*  if people are going out and protest with their cell phones, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=533.44s)]
*  if those cell phones are being identified [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=536.36s)]
*  at certain locations [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=539.0s)]
*  and that those people are being rounded up. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=540.36s)]
*  We don't quite know yet [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=542.4000000000001s)]
*  whether there's been an identification of protestors [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=544.48s)]
*  and spear phishing campaigns against protestors. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=547.08s)]
*  So we at least know that there has been [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=549.72s)]
*  definitely a specific focus [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=552.12s)]
*  and a directed focus on these protests [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=555.8000000000001s)]
*  by the censorship regime. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=558.52s)]
*  It looks like there is, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=560.2s)]
*  there has been some cases where it looks like [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=562.24s)]
*  there has been malware used [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=563.8000000000001s)]
*  targeting certain reformist or oppositional properties, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=565.2s)]
*  but we don't necessarily know the totality [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=569.0400000000001s)]
*  of how that circumstance has changed. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=571.32s)]
*  Just taking the big picture, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=574.52s)]
*  I mean, what Kong was saying about how [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=575.3599999999999s)]
*  after Rohani's election, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=576.4399999999999s)]
*  things had opened up a little bit. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=577.8399999999999s)]
*  I saw anecdote after anecdote in the news media [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=579.0799999999999s)]
*  about how ordinary Iranians away from Tehran [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=581.9599999999999s)]
*  would see images on Instagram [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=585.68s)]
*  of wealthy Iranians in Tehran [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=588.12s)]
*  boasting about how much money they were spending [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=592.04s)]
*  on their pets and showing off their SUVs. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=593.92s)]
*  And this had sort of stoked a lot of anger [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=596.7199999999999s)]
*  throughout the country. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=600.0s)]
*  President Rohani, the budget that he had publicized [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=601.76s)]
*  that sort of made clear how much money [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=604.5600000000001s)]
*  certain security organs and foundations were getting [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=607.4s)]
*  was spread through telegram and shared. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=611.28s)]
*  Do you think after these protests are suppressed [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=613.76s)]
*  that Rohani will lose that argument [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=616.48s)]
*  that he won't be able to say, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=618.76s)]
*  okay, we should keep the internet speeds relatively high [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=620.96s)]
*  and not censor as much, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=623.8000000000001s)]
*  or is that going to continue to be the same? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=625.6800000000001s)]
*  Where do you see that going? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=628.2s)]
*  Well, let me take your first point first, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=629.24s)]
*  because I think it's a very important one. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=630.88s)]
*  George Packer of the New Yorker wrote a piece, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=633.52s)]
*  and I think it was in the New York Times over 10 years ago, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=636.16s)]
*  and the title was When There Sees Here. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=639.72s)]
*  And he was talking about this in a global context, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=643.12s)]
*  but basically when people around the world [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=646.04s)]
*  living in Africa and Asia, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=649.68s)]
*  who are living in some cases at or below the poverty line, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=653.04s)]
*  when they start through social media, cable, television, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=658.4399999999999s)]
*  telegram, WhatsApp, they start to see how others [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=662.8s)]
*  around the world are living. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=666.16s)]
*  How is that going to impact them psychologically? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=667.4399999999999s)]
*  And I think that phenomenon we've seen in the United States [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=670.3199999999999s)]
*  and certainly in a country like Iran, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=673.9599999999999s)]
*  one of the stats which jumped out at me [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=676.76s)]
*  when these protests began [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=679.88s)]
*  and I was researching a piece for the Atlantic [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=681.12s)]
*  was that in 2009, one million Iranians had smartphones today, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=683.8s)]
*  48 million Iranians have smartphones. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=689.76s)]
*  And so I think that the first point you said, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=692.04s)]
*  which is this anger and disenchantment [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=695.88s)]
*  towards how many working class Iranians think, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=700.0s)]
*  Nuborish and upper class Iranians are living, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=704.4399999999999s)]
*  I think that is incredibly powerful. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=707.1999999999999s)]
*  The other thing I say is that in America, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=710.0799999999999s)]
*  if you catch your politician stealing [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=714.3599999999999s)]
*  or your clergyman stealing, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=718.16s)]
*  that is much more angering to you, right? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=719.92s)]
*  Because these are individuals who are supposed to be [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=723.04s)]
*  in positions of moral authority and responsibility. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=725.8399999999999s)]
*  And in Iran, your politician and clergyman [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=729.16s)]
*  are oftentimes the same people, right? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=732.8s)]
*  Because it's a theocratic system. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=734.3599999999999s)]
*  And so when you have a theocracy, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=736.4s)]
*  which is plundering and committing repression [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=739.4399999999999s)]
*  from a moral pedestal, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=743.24s)]
*  I think this is just incredibly angering to people. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=744.48s)]
*  And so Colin and I have talked about this a lot [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=748.12s)]
*  in terms of kind of internet speed and things like this. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=752.12s)]
*  It just seems to me that this is a train [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=755.8000000000001s)]
*  which has left the tracks. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=758.0s)]
*  Now that the Islamic Republic has embraced the internet [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=759.1600000000001s)]
*  and everyone has a smartphone, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=764.0s)]
*  they can't turn the off switch. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=767.2800000000001s)]
*  And the challenge we seem to have [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=770.76s)]
*  is that when there are moments like this, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=772.68s)]
*  all of us say, okay, we have to think about ways [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=774.68s)]
*  to inhibit the regime's ability to control information [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=777.7199999999999s)]
*  and repress and monopolize communications. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=781.12s)]
*  And then the moment passes, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=784.12s)]
*  and then our attention goes elsewhere. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=786.52s)]
*  And then when there is another tumult, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=788.8s)]
*  whether it's in Iran or another authoritarian regime, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=792.04s)]
*  we're kind of caught flat-footed again. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=795.28s)]
*  So I hope this time around, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=797.4399999999999s)]
*  there is maybe more of a sustained conversation [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=800.88s)]
*  about what practical measures, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=803.32s)]
*  Vice President Pence had a Washington Post op-ed saying, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=806.84s)]
*  we stand with the Iranian people. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=809.72s)]
*  And I just think that rather than the statements [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=812.16s)]
*  which are made by US officials [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=816.32s)]
*  or the tweets by US presidents, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=818.48s)]
*  what's much more constructive [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=820.48s)]
*  is what practically can be done [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=821.76s)]
*  to inhibit these regimes, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=825.6s)]
*  whether it's Iran or another regime, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=827.96s)]
*  their ability to keep their populations back. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=831.12s)]
*  Just a final question before we get [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=834.08s)]
*  to the actual contents of the report. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=835.5600000000001s)]
*  What practically can be done? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=837.2s)]
*  Are there relatively easy steps that the US could take [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=838.8000000000001s)]
*  or tech companies could take to ensure [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=843.16s)]
*  that Iranians have access to their tools? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=846.2s)]
*  Well, I think to start off on a positive note, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=848.52s)]
*  Iranians have been the beneficiary of a sort of, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=852.6800000000001s)]
*  what is often called the internet freedom agenda, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=857.6800000000001s)]
*  which is a set of programs and funding [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=861.08s)]
*  which has bipartisan support intended to open up access [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=864.04s)]
*  to information inside of the country. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=869.2s)]
*  And so probably the primary example of that would be [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=871.24s)]
*  the majority of the tools that are provided to Iranians [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=874.2s)]
*  to bypass the filtering regime [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=876.84s)]
*  are actually funded by US and European governments. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=879.16s)]
*  And these are safe and secure tools [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=883.96s)]
*  rather than privately provided [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=886.8s)]
*  or domestically provided tools [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=888.48s)]
*  which open up access to the internet. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=890.5200000000001s)]
*  And this funding has also been very useful [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=893.6800000000001s)]
*  in making sure that at times like this [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=895.44s)]
*  in which there is a sort of a scaling up [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=898.36s)]
*  of the blocking of these tools, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=901.4000000000001s)]
*  there are people on the other side [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=902.96s)]
*  whose specific job is to make sure [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=904.8000000000001s)]
*  that they remain available. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=907.0s)]
*  I think that that's a success story and I think. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=908.44s)]
*  I think there are some ways in which [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=919.44s)]
*  there has been attempts to be better [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=922.6800000000001s)]
*  and to open up access and there's, but there's still. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=925.48s)]
*  Or providing VPNs to Iranians. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=948.44s)]
*  Now these policies have led [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=955.6800000000001s)]
*  to certain American tech companies [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=959.2800000000001s)]
*  opening up certain services [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=961.12s)]
*  that otherwise wouldn't be available. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=962.5200000000001s)]
*  But there are still very important products [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=964.8000000000001s)]
*  and platforms that are still not accessible [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=967.84s)]
*  because there are sanctions concerns. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=970.96s)]
*  One of the areas of focus has been [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=973.0400000000001s)]
*  Google's App Engine service. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=976.56s)]
*  This is a service that has been used in Egypt [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=978.4399999999999s)]
*  and the Emirates in order to bypass [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=982.28s)]
*  government imposed blocking of secure communications tools. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=986.56s)]
*  Unfortunately because of certain compliance concerns, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=990.68s)]
*  Google App Engine is not available in Iran. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=994.7199999999999s)]
*  And so subsequently what could be a powerful tool [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=997.3199999999999s)]
*  for bypassing the filtering regime [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=999.88s)]
*  is not available on a selective basis. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1002.4s)]
*  I think that these are areas in which [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1005.12s)]
*  there could be a focus of the United States government [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1007.44s)]
*  in collaboration with the private sector [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1009.88s)]
*  in order to make services that are unavailable available. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1011.8s)]
*  Because the last thing that we want [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1016.28s)]
*  is there to be two filtering regimes. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1018.04s)]
*  One the Iranian government [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1020.88s)]
*  and the second the American government. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1022.48s)]
*  We wanna make sure this thing that we can all agree on [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1024.08s)]
*  which is that Iranians should have access to the internet [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1028.12s)]
*  is protected and secure and open. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1031.8s)]
*  So on that note, let's get into the actual findings [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1035.76s)]
*  of the report. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1037.1200000000001s)]
*  It's a really remarkable report. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1038.4s)]
*  I think it adds a lot in terms of helping us all understand [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1040.16s)]
*  the strategic intent behind Iran's cyber activities [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1042.96s)]
*  and beyond just its targeting of private sector [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1047.3200000000002s)]
*  or even government entities in the West or in Saudi Arabia. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1052.04s)]
*  The actions that it's taking within Iran [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1055.24s)]
*  against both dissidents but also reformist factions [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1058.68s)]
*  and even its own government officials. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1063.04s)]
*  And then also in the Iranian diaspora. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1065.8799999999999s)]
*  So I was wondering if, Karyme, you could start off [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1068.0s)]
*  by telling us a little bit about the genesis of the report [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1070.24s)]
*  and how it came about. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1072.24s)]
*  So I think that our timing has been incredibly fortuitous [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1074.04s)]
*  that the report is launched this week [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1079.48s)]
*  when this is a timely topic. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1081.12s)]
*  But we actually began this conversation, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1082.36s)]
*  Colin and I, over two years ago. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1084.8799999999999s)]
*  And it was shortly after the arrest [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1086.76s)]
*  of a close friend of mine, Siamak Namazi, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1089.96s)]
*  who has been in prison over two years in Iran [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1092.48s)]
*  since October 2015. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1095.52s)]
*  And one of the things that the regime did after Siamak [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1097.72s)]
*  and hours after he was imprisoned, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1101.28s)]
*  and we talk about this in the report, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1103.1200000000001s)]
*  was that they took over his email accounts [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1105.2s)]
*  and they pretended to be him. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1107.92s)]
*  And they sent emails to a lot of his contacts, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1109.8s)]
*  including folks in this room, including myself, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1112.96s)]
*  saying, pretending to be Siamak and saying, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1115.72s)]
*  this is an op-ed that he had written about the JCPOA [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1119.0s)]
*  and whether the recipients could edit that op-ed. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1122.68s)]
*  And if you open that attachment, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1128.2s)]
*  the Islamic Republic could take over your Gmail account [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1131.92s)]
*  and in some cases your computer. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1135.0800000000002s)]
*  And they did incredible damage as a result. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1136.96s)]
*  And so over the years, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1140.8000000000002s)]
*  I had also been, the Islamic Republic, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1142.1200000000001s)]
*  attempted to hack my accounts. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1144.8400000000001s)]
*  And the way I know this is that for those of you [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1146.76s)]
*  in the room who use Gmail, I'd encourage all of you, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1149.88s)]
*  if you haven't already, to use two-step notification. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1152.88s)]
*  Because what happens with two-step notification [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1155.88s)]
*  is that you'll get a text message [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1158.5200000000002s)]
*  when someone is trying to log into your Gmail account [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1160.72s)]
*  from an unfamiliar device. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1163.88s)]
*  And there was one morning, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1165.8400000000001s)]
*  I have some friends who work at Google, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1167.0400000000002s)]
*  so they encouraged me to do this years ago. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1169.2s)]
*  And one morning quite early, 6 a.m., [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1171.8400000000001s)]
*  I received dozens of texts back to back. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1174.3600000000001s)]
*  Someone is trying to get into your, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1177.88s)]
*  what is your passcode? [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1180.44s)]
*  Google will send you a text message [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1182.48s)]
*  as a two-step entry into your Gmail account. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1185.48s)]
*  And I kept getting dozens of these codes, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1188.64s)]
*  so it was clear to me someone was trying to log onto my Gmail [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1191.2s)]
*  from an unfamiliar device. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1194.32s)]
*  So I woke up my poor friends who work in Mountain View, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1195.96s)]
*  because it was very early in the morning DC time, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1199.1200000000001s)]
*  it was even earlier, three hours earlier Mountain View time. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1201.72s)]
*  And they said, yeah, we're actually watching this happen [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1205.1200000000001s)]
*  in real time and they could tell in some cases, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1208.24s)]
*  this was coming from Iran if the hackers [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1211.96s)]
*  weren't sophisticated enough to be able [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1215.56s)]
*  to conceal their location. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1217.36s)]
*  So this is a topic that I've been interested in [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1220.24s)]
*  for personal reasons, obviously the issue of 2009 as well. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1224.8s)]
*  And Colin said to me that he had been monitoring this [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1228.4s)]
*  for a very long time. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1232.76s)]
*  And so we had an initial conversation [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1234.04s)]
*  and he sent me his findings, which were incredible. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1237.48s)]
*  But I'm so ignorant about this topic that I had no idea [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1242.1200000000001s)]
*  about two thirds of what he was sending me [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1245.96s)]
*  and the terminology and what was going on. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1248.56s)]
*  And so that's why to his credit, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1251.6s)]
*  Colin was unbelievably patient with me. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1253.96s)]
*  This was like a two year writing process [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1256.8s)]
*  and our editors at Carnegie were really fantastic as well. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1260.4s)]
*  I'm reminded of something that Walter Isaacson, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1264.28s)]
*  who was a wonderful biographer, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1267.48s)]
*  told me once about his book about Albert Einstein. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1269.6399999999999s)]
*  He wrote a great biography of Albert Einstein [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1272.68s)]
*  and he said that, he said I had to relearn calculus [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1274.56s)]
*  so my readers didn't have to. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1277.44s)]
*  And so the challenge of this report was me [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1279.36s)]
*  learning from scratch all of these things [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1282.6s)]
*  which I knew nothing about. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1284.48s)]
*  So all of you hopefully won't necessarily have to. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1286.48s)]
*  I thought if I don't understand it then [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1290.3999999999999s)]
*  the broader readership may not. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1293.36s)]
*  And we wanted to make this report [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1295.0s)]
*  not just for a tech and cyber crowd [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1296.76s)]
*  but something which is accessible to a lay audience. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1299.36s)]
*  So Colin was incredibly patient with me [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1301.68s)]
*  if there was a sentence or a term I didn't understand. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1304.36s)]
*  What does this mean? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1306.92s)]
*  What does this mean? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1307.76s)]
*  What does this mean? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1308.6s)]
*  And I think in the process he told me himself [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1309.44s)]
*  this was like an MA master's degree in writing for you. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1311.84s)]
*  So that was basically the genesis of it. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1315.6399999999999s)]
*  Tim, I wanna bring you into the conversation as well. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1319.52s)]
*  The report describes sort of a fuzzy connection [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1323.72s)]
*  between these Iranian threat actors [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1326.6000000000001s)]
*  and the actual Iranian government. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1328.6000000000001s)]
*  And it's not, it's very rare that the Iranian government [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1330.3200000000002s)]
*  actually takes credit for any single attack [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1333.5200000000002s)]
*  or there are even contradictions in what it says [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1336.8000000000002s)]
*  about its own cyber capabilities. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1339.16s)]
*  Can you put that in contact? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1341.3200000000002s)]
*  Is that sort of, are there parallels [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1342.3600000000001s)]
*  when it comes to China's behavior, Russia's behavior? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1345.1200000000001s)]
*  How should we read that particular aspect [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1347.4s)]
*  of Iran's cyber activities? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1350.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think there are two aspects to that. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1353.6399999999999s)]
*  The first one is the technical aspect [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1355.48s)]
*  where because of the internet and how it works [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1358.32s)]
*  that you can conceal the origin of an attack. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1360.72s)]
*  But I think the report and some of Colin's research [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1364.4399999999998s)]
*  also shows that what's often called [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1366.9199999999998s)]
*  is the attribution problem is not a question necessarily [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1369.36s)]
*  of if it can be attributed but rather when. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1372.1999999999998s)]
*  And that if an actor has either the way it says Colin does [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1375.24s)]
*  or additional resources like a state does, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1379.04s)]
*  you're able to actually trace back [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1381.6s)]
*  a lot of the malicious activity [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1383.12s)]
*  because a malicious actor might not be careful [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1384.44s)]
*  and might not be very good at concealing their identity. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1387.2s)]
*  And the indictments that we've seen [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1390.36s)]
*  come out of the US government, for example, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1391.8s)]
*  provide very good insight into that. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1393.6s)]
*  And the second piece is that certain states [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1395.76s)]
*  tend to use actors that are detached from the states [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1398.2s)]
*  to further increase possible deniability. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1401.24s)]
*  If you look at proxy actors [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1404.8799999999999s)]
*  when it comes to malicious cyber activity, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1407.64s)]
*  I think sometimes we are quick to jump to the conclusion [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1409.56s)]
*  that this is a new phenomenon when it comes to cyber. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1411.96s)]
*  But when you actually start digging a little deeper [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1414.84s)]
*  and you compare countries, it turns out that it's more [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1416.72s)]
*  an extension of how states have been using these actors [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1419.3600000000001s)]
*  in the past and that I think Iran is a fantastic case study [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1422.24s)]
*  for how a country within the span of a decade, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1425.76s)]
*  I think the first reports about when Iran [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1428.88s)]
*  started developing offensive cyber tools [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1430.8s)]
*  stayed back about 2007. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1433.08s)]
*  So within the span of a decade, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1434.88s)]
*  Iran was able to develop these capabilities [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1436.3999999999999s)]
*  and essentially was using its existing system [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1438.6799999999998s)]
*  and was able to mobilize these actors [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1441.6s)]
*  to project their political power in that space. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1444.36s)]
*  So let's get into Colin, what you actually did observe. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1449.36s)]
*  And the report is based obviously on open source research [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1452.28s)]
*  but also research that you conducted, primary research [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1456.0s)]
*  where you actually observed some of these attacks happening. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1458.9599999999998s)]
*  So I was wondering if you could bring out a few anecdotes [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1461.04s)]
*  for us who are like Kerry, maybe cyber illiterate, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1463.68s)]
*  explain those sort of how that works [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1466.92s)]
*  and then what did you actually observe? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1469.04s)]
*  So I think maybe part of the answer to that [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1471.2s)]
*  comes out of the genesis of this. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1474.04s)]
*  What was interesting is that I've had the fortune [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1475.48s)]
*  of having relationships, working in partnerships [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1478.72s)]
*  with members of the Iranian civil society [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1482.96s)]
*  and human rights community for some time. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1485.48s)]
*  One of the things that was often talked about [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1488.28s)]
*  is these state-based hacking campaigns. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1489.96s)]
*  But 2010, 2011, as best as I could, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1494.96s)]
*  I could never get examples of somebody getting spear fished, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1499.16s)]
*  having their account stolen, receiving malware. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1502.0s)]
*  2012, I started to really specifically focus, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1505.68s)]
*  raising attention saying, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1509.1200000000001s)]
*  if you get anything, send it to me. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1510.8s)]
*  Still nothing. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1513.32s)]
*  And then suddenly two months before the 2013 election, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1514.8400000000001s)]
*  I get too much. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1519.0s)]
*  It was just too much. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1520.36s)]
*  Too much malware, too much phishing. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1521.76s)]
*  And what was interesting about this is that, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1523.96s)]
*  having looked back at it a little bit later, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1526.6s)]
*  and especially in the context of private sector reports, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1528.6s)]
*  all of a sudden the groups that I was seeing [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1532.28s)]
*  sending malware to dissidents outside of the country [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1534.24s)]
*  were groups that were getting published on later [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1537.52s)]
*  as having tried to engage in military espionage, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1540.28s)]
*  having tried to attack a Saudi oil refinery, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1543.68s)]
*  having tried to get into a US government system. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1548.92s)]
*  These were the same groups. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1552.0800000000002s)]
*  This was the same malware. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1553.28s)]
*  And so what's useful is that, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1555.28s)]
*  within the cybersecurity community, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1558.64s)]
*  there are professional practices [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1560.24s)]
*  that give you access to a great deal of broader insight [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1563.48s)]
*  into what's happening in certain campaigns. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1566.48s)]
*  An example that I've given that is accessible [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1569.64s)]
*  is just the principle of sinkholing. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1572.76s)]
*  When you get malware, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1576.0s)]
*  the way that malware often communicates is [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1577.24s)]
*  that it has to communicate back to attackers. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1579.92s)]
*  Often what it does is it contacts a domain name, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1583.84s)]
*  like mymalware.com, in order to understand [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1586.4s)]
*  where to send the files that it has stolen. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1589.6s)]
*  There are a variety of ways of getting access [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1593.92s)]
*  to that domain name. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1596.36s)]
*  Often you can ask domain name providers. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1597.76s)]
*  Often that domain name has expired [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1600.24s)]
*  because the malware is older and you can just re-register it. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1602.08s)]
*  Suddenly you can potentially interdict the communications [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1605.48s)]
*  of this malware network. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1608.92s)]
*  If you're sitting on that, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1610.96s)]
*  you're suddenly seeing who's been compromised. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1612.0800000000002s)]
*  That starts to tell you the broader profile. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1614.68s)]
*  You've gone from one dissident sitting in London [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1617.04s)]
*  that received a malware to a broader sense [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1620.32s)]
*  of who was targeted or compromised by this campaign. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1623.3600000000001s)]
*  In other cases, I think the first case was that [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1626.92s)]
*  the malware that was communicating actually had [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1631.4s)]
*  an embedded username and password. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1634.48s)]
*  If you just connected to that same resource [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1637.96s)]
*  with that username and password, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1640.24s)]
*  you could see all of the other files that were stolen. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1642.48s)]
*  It was pretty simple to understand [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1645.3200000000002s)]
*  who was being targeted and being compromised. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1647.24s)]
*  What this provided us, I think, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1650.76s)]
*  which was uniquely valuable, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1653.1200000000001s)]
*  is kind of like a longitudinal understanding [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1654.88s)]
*  of what somebody was doing at one time. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1657.76s)]
*  And by having sat in this [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1660.9399999999998s)]
*  and having maintained these relationships [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1663.54s)]
*  and having gotten a broader sense of other campaigns, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1665.3799999999999s)]
*  we could start to piece it together. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1670.4199999999998s)]
*  And what we saw was that there was a lot of, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1672.82s)]
*  there were a number of reports that were being published, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1675.82s)]
*  especially about attacks against the private sector, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1677.98s)]
*  against economic infrastructure, against defense companies. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1681.4599999999998s)]
*  And these were often the same groups, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1684.6999999999998s)]
*  the same malware that we were tracking. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1686.82s)]
*  These were often the same people [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1688.3799999999999s)]
*  that were going after domestic dissidents [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1690.5s)]
*  were the same people that were going [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1692.3799999999999s)]
*  after regional adversaries. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1693.58s)]
*  And it actually makes sense, right? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1696.26s)]
*  What is the Islamic Republic afraid of? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1698.9399999999998s)]
*  Karim can answer this better than I can. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1701.4599999999998s)]
*  But my childish attempt at comparative politics would say, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1703.4599999999998s)]
*  I think that the Iranian government [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1709.02s)]
*  is not necessarily as afraid of external invasion [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1710.74s)]
*  as they are internal dissent. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1714.12s)]
*  And so if you're prioritizing your resources, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1716.9s)]
*  yes, you might try to find, you know, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1719.66s)]
*  like technical information about a European fighter jet, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1721.5s)]
*  that might be a useful thing for you to know. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1725.1000000000001s)]
*  But the existential fight, the regime stability fight [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1727.22s)]
*  is against reformist opposition, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1730.7800000000002s)]
*  is against even more so, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1733.3400000000001s)]
*  is against people in the periphery of the country [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1736.7800000000002s)]
*  who might have grievances [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1738.98s)]
*  about how ethnic minorities are treated. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1740.8600000000001s)]
*  It might be a BBC journalist in London [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1744.42s)]
*  who was very capable of digging up dirt [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1747.8200000000002s)]
*  about economic corruption. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1750.38s)]
*  And so what we saw was there was a lot of this sort of [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1752.48s)]
*  overlap between these campaigns [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1755.54s)]
*  that we were seeing the private sector write about [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1757.42s)]
*  and the campaigns that we were seeing [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1759.8200000000002s)]
*  targeting people that were familiar with the community. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1761.8600000000001s)]
*  And so it became interesting and useful to start talking, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1765.18s)]
*  looking at this in a broader sense [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1769.1000000000001s)]
*  and start to look at these things. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1771.04s)]
*  And these themes are repeated and they're common [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1773.06s)]
*  and they're obvious. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1775.1799999999998s)]
*  And what we wanted to do is really kind of, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1776.74s)]
*  I think, take out those themes [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1780.06s)]
*  and show them to a broader audience. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1782.62s)]
*  Sorry, if I can just share a few anecdotes as well [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1785.1399999999999s)]
*  in case I forget later. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1788.1s)]
*  And maybe these are anecdotes slash questions for Colin. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1790.46s)]
*  I mean, in the course of this report, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1793.54s)]
*  I would get emails and texts from Colin and he'd say, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1795.06s)]
*  do you know such and such individual, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1798.3799999999999s)]
*  and it was oftentimes a senior, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1801.3s)]
*  former Obama administration official, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1803.58s)]
*  and he'd say, can you let them know [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1805.46s)]
*  that there is going to be an email in their inbox [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1807.8999999999999s)]
*  and it's purporting to be someone from Human Rights Watch [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1811.5s)]
*  with a report about the human rights situation [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1814.3s)]
*  in the next country. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1816.5s)]
*  Tell them not to open that report [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1817.54s)]
*  because that's a phishing attack [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1819.28s)]
*  and if they open it, their computer or their email account [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1821.7s)]
*  is going to be compromised. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1825.22s)]
*  I guess the question for you is [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1826.6s)]
*  how the hell did you know these things? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1827.7s)]
*  I never understood or figured that out. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1830.22s)]
*  The second, which is also an anecdote, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1833.18s)]
*  something I find funny, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1835.42s)]
*  it may have no strategic slash cyber consequences, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1836.5s)]
*  but I was always amused how these individuals [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1840.34s)]
*  who are essentially working [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1843.7s)]
*  for the Islamic Republic of Iran, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1844.78s)]
*  either you found out they had hardcore pornography [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1847.14s)]
*  on their laptops or they would actually deface others [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1850.42s)]
*  using pornography, which is an interesting paradox [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1854.78s)]
*  that these people working for an Islamist theocracy [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1859.7s)]
*  engage in that kind of stuff. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1862.86s)]
*  The third thing is, one of my main takeaways, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1864.94s)]
*  one of the main things I learned from this [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1868.86s)]
*  is the parallels between the way Iran projects power [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1871.26s)]
*  externally and how it uses cyber, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1875.02s)]
*  which is essentially to use organizations like Hezbollah [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1877.16s)]
*  or Shia militias or the Houthis in Yemen [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1881.46s)]
*  in which they have plausible deniability. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1884.42s)]
*  So they can say, well, these folks are independent. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1886.7s)]
*  I remember years ago when I was based in Tehran [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1890.6200000000001s)]
*  with International Crisis Group [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1893.66s)]
*  and I would interview Iranian officials about Hezbollah, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1895.0600000000002s)]
*  they would say, no, no, Hezbollah, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1898.44s)]
*  we only provide them moral support, that's it. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1900.2600000000002s)]
*  Nowadays, Hassan Nasrallah says you can't sanction us [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1903.2600000000002s)]
*  because all of our support and resources come from Iran, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1905.74s)]
*  but they have this kind of plausible deniability [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1908.5800000000002s)]
*  in a way to be able to say, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1911.8999999999999s)]
*  it implicitly signals what Iran is capable of, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1914.8999999999999s)]
*  but on the surface, they can also deny [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1918.74s)]
*  that they have any involvement with it. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1921.22s)]
*  Do you wanna enlighten us a little bit [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1923.62s)]
*  on some of the specific attacks [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1925.62s)]
*  and phishing attempts that you witnessed? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1927.34s)]
*  And the porn stuff. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1929.1399999999999s)]
*  The porn stuff. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1930.34s)]
*  There's a lot of porn stuff. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1931.42s)]
*  And there's a lot of cases in which you see [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1935.54s)]
*  very professional, let's say, intellectual class people [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1937.8999999999999s)]
*  unfortunately falling for spear phishing attempts [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1942.9399999999998s)]
*  that appear to be nude pictures [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1945.3799999999999s)]
*  from an attractive young woman. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1947.78s)]
*  You're embarrassed for that individual at that time. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1950.26s)]
*  You wanna be like, why did you fall for that? [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1954.06s)]
*  I think again the value is, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1958.6999999999998s)]
*  and I would love to surface this more over time, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1961.6999999999998s)]
*  there's so many illustrative examples [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1965.14s)]
*  of how these attacks tell us broader things. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1968.18s)]
*  One of the things that I am going to, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1971.1s)]
*  I think that we'll have the opportunity [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1973.18s)]
*  to surface a little bit more, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1975.06s)]
*  but we allude to it in the paper, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1976.42s)]
*  is that if you take, for example, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1978.54s)]
*  the first public illustration of Iran's cyber capacity, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1979.94s)]
*  it's the Iranian cyber army. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1985.5s)]
*  Starting in December 2009, [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1989.02s)]
*  I think in response to perceptions [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1991.14s)]
*  that the internet was being used [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1993.22s)]
*  as American cyber warfare against Iran, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1995.42s)]
*  you had groups, defacement groups, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=1998.74s)]
*  a defacement group suddenly vandalizing [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2001.98s)]
*  certain opposition websites, certain Israeli websites, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2005.8600000000001s)]
*  and actually their largest victories or accomplishments [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2009.7s)]
*  was briefly defacing Twitter, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2015.78s)]
*  as well as briefly defacing the Chinese search engine Baidu. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2018.38s)]
*  What was really interesting is that we were given access [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2022.66s)]
*  to some historical records about domain registrations, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2026.14s)]
*  and we actually found a little bit [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2030.5s)]
*  when Baidu sued its registrar, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2032.8600000000001s)]
*  and we were able to connect to the dots. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2034.98s)]
*  And what was interesting is that this campaign, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2037.3000000000002s)]
*  when it was published, there was a number of op-eds [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2041.38s)]
*  and statements saying, this is Iran's ability [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2044.14s)]
*  to inflict damage on the United States. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2047.9s)]
*  This is indication that the Russians are supporting [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2051.22s)]
*  the Iranians in cyber warfare. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2054.4199999999996s)]
*  This is indication that Iranians are first tier cyber actor [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2056.06s)]
*  that they're able to take down Twitter. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2060.06s)]
*  And when we start to kind of put the elements together [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2062.3399999999997s)]
*  and string things together, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2065.9399999999996s)]
*  it starts to look like actually the person [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2067.8999999999996s)]
*  that was the Iranian cyber army [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2070.14s)]
*  was potentially maybe one person [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2072.4199999999996s)]
*  who knew how to speak English [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2074.9399999999996s)]
*  and knew how to socially manipulate [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2077.18s)]
*  and work some of these domain name registrars, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2079.7s)]
*  some of these elements of the internet infrastructure [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2082.3399999999997s)]
*  to his benefit and had been doing so [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2085.94s)]
*  over the course of six years for cyber crime, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2088.8599999999997s)]
*  who had been stealing domain names [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2092.94s)]
*  and reselling them on the market. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2094.8999999999996s)]
*  And so, and we actually, I think, I found the guy. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2096.94s)]
*  I think his name is Omid, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2100.8599999999997s)]
*  and his social media profile talks about [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2102.62s)]
*  how he likes hot dogs and making big money. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2104.62s)]
*  And he lives in Shiraz. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2107.78s)]
*  And I think that that was such an enormously useful [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2110.02s)]
*  illustration of this asymmetry, right? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2113.18s)]
*  And especially how Iran could, through proxies, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2116.3s)]
*  appear to be larger than it is. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2119.86s)]
*  The Iranian cyber army as a concept [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2122.1s)]
*  is still banded about often, right? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2125.46s)]
*  It has taken on its own kind of life [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2127.66s)]
*  despite the fact that there hasn't been any activity [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2130.14s)]
*  in its name since 2013. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2132.62s)]
*  But what it showed is Omid and Shiraz [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2135.18s)]
*  could project this global ambition [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2139.14s)]
*  in terms of the media. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2144.18s)]
*  And so what we've tried to do is we've tried [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2146.18s)]
*  to connect these sorts of things. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2147.8199999999997s)]
*  We've been able to say, the second case [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2149.22s)]
*  that I think that we really anchor ourselves on [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2152.5s)]
*  is a malware campaign that was called Mahdi, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2154.98s)]
*  which was the first published report [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2158.58s)]
*  by cyber security companies. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2164.1s)]
*  Kaspersky was one of the companies that published on it. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2167.8599999999997s)]
*  And this was a somewhat broad campaign of cyber espionage [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2170.4199999999996s)]
*  using indigently developed malware [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2174.7s)]
*  that had clearly been effective at compromising [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2177.54s)]
*  a number of American and Israeli institutions [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2180.18s)]
*  to gain some access to data. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2182.58s)]
*  What's interesting, and we didn't do the attribution on this, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2184.98s)]
*  somebody else had found it, it looks like basically [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2187.98s)]
*  that came out of the Iranian debasement community. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2190.5s)]
*  That some people inside of the country since 2007, 2008, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2193.38s)]
*  had been developing malware, selling it mostly to spy [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2197.74s)]
*  on people's girlfriends, and that was instrumentalized [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2200.86s)]
*  in order to pursue these more political ambitions [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2205.74s)]
*  after the fact. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2208.82s)]
*  And similarly, this had been happening since 2008, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2210.06s)]
*  but suddenly you see in 2010, these being directed [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2214.22s)]
*  towards global and domestic ambitions. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2218.22s)]
*  And in that vein, we see this is a recurrent theme, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2221.4199999999996s)]
*  that these groups that had been defacing all of a sudden [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2226.22s)]
*  in 2009 and 2010 realized that they can form [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2228.66s)]
*  private companies. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2231.8199999999997s)]
*  And you often see the vestiges of these quasi [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2232.7s)]
*  penetration company information, penetration testing [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2237.3399999999997s)]
*  information security companies that are formed, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2240.9399999999996s)]
*  that are small but consequential, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2243.8199999999997s)]
*  but seem to be contracting to the state. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2245.78s)]
*  All of a sudden in 2010, the state seems to be hiring people [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2248.34s)]
*  to be doing its work, to be doing some sort of espionage [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2252.02s)]
*  work or to be doing cyber operations. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2256.46s)]
*  And this is pretty common. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2259.86s)]
*  When you read the reports from the private sector, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2262.38s)]
*  you see a lot of these groups suddenly are interested [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2264.94s)]
*  in 2009, and it really kind of, I think again, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2267.82s)]
*  illustrates a point, which was assumed, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2271.46s)]
*  but really kind of with information illustrates a point, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2273.86s)]
*  which is it seems to have been the Green Movement [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2276.7400000000002s)]
*  and Stuxnet that really prompted Iran to be aware [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2281.26s)]
*  that this was an area in which it was attacked, [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2284.7000000000003s)]
*  and it is an area in which it could retaliate, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2287.1s)]
*  and it is an area in which it could pursue its regional [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2289.1400000000003s)]
*  and domestic interests through. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2292.26s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead, Tom. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2295.98s)]
*  Just to build on Colin's point, I think Iran is a really [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2297.5s)]
*  fascinating case study because it also shows this interplay [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2300.1400000000003s)]
*  between the international politics [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2302.54s)]
*  and the domestic politics. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2305.22s)]
*  And we also had a New York Times article that talked about [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2306.62s)]
*  the internet in a suitcase and specifically about Iran. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2311.18s)]
*  If I sit in Tehran and I read this article [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2314.74s)]
*  about the New York Times, in the New York Times, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2316.74s)]
*  that makes me also imagine all sorts of things [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2319.22s)]
*  about what the US is up to, right? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2321.98s)]
*  So what's so fascinating about the Iranian case [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2323.54s)]
*  that Colin alluded to earlier is with the same groups [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2327.3s)]
*  targeting dissidents abroad, focusing on dissidents at home [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2330.3s)]
*  but also companies is how governments like Tehran [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2333.34s)]
*  but also others, for example, I think how the Kremlin [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2337.1800000000003s)]
*  thinks about this, how Beijing thinks about this, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2339.82s)]
*  looking at this lens through information security [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2341.82s)]
*  and the control of information in a much broader sense [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2343.98s)]
*  than how we usually think about cybersecurity. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2346.42s)]
*  This event has the tagline with cyber attached to it, right? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2349.2200000000003s)]
*  But I think a lot of times in the West, we fall a bit [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2351.94s)]
*  in this trap of only looking at critical infrastructure, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2355.1000000000004s)]
*  which coincidentally last year all of a sudden changed [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2357.82s)]
*  with the election interference and people starting thinking [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2361.02s)]
*  much more about content and the role that that could play. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2363.26s)]
*  But Iran is a really interesting case study for how it's using [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2366.94s)]
*  these offensive tools across the board for both the domestic [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2369.7000000000003s)]
*  and the external projection of power [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2373.3s)]
*  that the regime is trying to undertake. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2375.34s)]
*  The methods that Iran does employ and what Colin was mentioning, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2377.5800000000004s)]
*  how one person could sort of pose as the Iranian cyber army [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2381.1400000000003s)]
*  and really kind of inflates Iran's cyber capabilities. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2384.9s)]
*  What challenges does that pose for the US [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2388.7000000000003s)]
*  or for sort of just global entities that want to enforce [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2391.6600000000003s)]
*  any kind of developing cyber norm or cyber rule [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2396.02s)]
*  that the global community is really working on? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2399.2200000000003s)]
*  How does Iran fit into that or challenge that goal? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2401.98s)]
*  It's a great question and I think one also with regard [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2405.46s)]
*  to the upcoming year that I think the White House [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2407.82s)]
*  is thinking about in terms of how it can impose [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2409.7400000000002s)]
*  more consequences on actors generally that engage [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2411.58s)]
*  in malicious cyber activity. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2413.94s)]
*  If we take the example of the US indictment that came out [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2415.82s)]
*  that indicted seven Iranian nationals, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2419.14s)]
*  it's a good case study because it shows three people [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2421.86s)]
*  who were part of one company and then four [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2424.54s)]
*  who were part of another company. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2426.42s)]
*  And as part of the research I did for a separate project, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2428.26s)]
*  I found that the four Iranians who were part [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2431.06s)]
*  of that one company had been publicly boasting [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2433.38s)]
*  about their web defacements on Zone H, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2435.78s)]
*  which is a website for hackers where you can go [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2438.58s)]
*  if you deface the website and you can claim [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2440.58s)]
*  credit for it and then in 2012 they all of a sudden [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2444.7400000000002s)]
*  disappear after two years of posting these web defacements [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2446.6200000000003s)]
*  and that's exactly the point in time where the US [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2449.5800000000004s)]
*  indictment claims that they started working with [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2451.7000000000003s)]
*  this other company including the one individual [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2453.54s)]
*  who has a relationship with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2456.1400000000003s)]
*  and that's when the DDoS attacks happen against [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2459.5s)]
*  US financial institutions. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2461.34s)]
*  So we focus very much on the control of information [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2463.46s)]
*  during this event so far. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2467.2200000000003s)]
*  There's the other dimension of it with Saudi Aramco, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2468.5s)]
*  the DDoS attacks against US financial institutions [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2471.5s)]
*  and the US indictment so far has been the most public [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2474.26s)]
*  example of what the US government has done in response [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2477.14s)]
*  by trying to publicly name and shame to demonstrate [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2479.46s)]
*  that attribution is possible, that we can find out [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2482.78s)]
*  who is behind it but what you can actually do [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2484.94s)]
*  with regard to these individuals, it's highly unlikely [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2488.26s)]
*  that these four will be arrested anytime soon [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2491.02s)]
*  unless they happen to travel to a country on vacation [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2493.54s)]
*  that happens to have an extradition treaty [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2495.82s)]
*  with the United States, covert means but that gets [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2497.78s)]
*  into it, we might find out in a couple of decades [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2500.8199999999997s)]
*  but it's a really hard question that I think is [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2502.98s)]
*  somewhat unique to cyber because unlike international [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2504.98s)]
*  terrorism where you have a few individuals, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2508.18s)]
*  they still need to be geographically close to their target [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2510.74s)]
*  when it comes to hacking, that's no longer the case. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2513.62s)]
*  So Kennedy made the point that Iran's use of cyber tools [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2516.62s)]
*  sort of reflects its use of proxies in the real world [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2520.18s)]
*  as well, one thing I wanted to, that was really interesting [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2523.14s)]
*  in the report is that for anyone who's a scholar of Iran, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2526.2599999999998s)]
*  you're immediately aware of how factionalized the system is [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2529.22s)]
*  and how internally divided it is and you document a lot [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2531.8999999999996s)]
*  of this actually happening where people like [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2535.06s)]
*  the foreign minister are attacked or fished by [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2538.58s)]
*  presumably people connected to the Islamic Revolutionary [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2544.54s)]
*  Guard Corps, former reformist politicians, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2546.7s)]
*  can you talk a little bit about what you observed [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2550.22s)]
*  on that front? [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2552.06s)]
*  Well so actually if we go back, some of the oldest groups, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2553.22s)]
*  so there's a group that's connected with the [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2557.46s)]
*  Ministry of Intelligence, it's colloquially named [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2560.42s)]
*  within the cyber security community Magic Kitten. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2564.86s)]
*  Magic Kitten actually it turns out had been [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2568.06s)]
*  thoroughly compromised by the NSA and there are helpful [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2571.14s)]
*  slides that show who they were targeting because this was [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2574.14s)]
*  a training session within the NSA, a presentation [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2577.66s)]
*  from a training session that had been leaked by Snowden [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2582.66s)]
*  and what you look is that while they redact the addresses, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2587.2999999999997s)]
*  they've missed a couple and you look and actually the [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2589.3399999999997s)]
*  addresses in those slides are within the country [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2593.02s)]
*  and in fact they are institutions in Qom, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2596.62s)]
*  they are media institutions that are affiliated with [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2601.8199999999997s)]
*  the Iranian government such as IRIB, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2605.2999999999997s)]
*  the state media broadcaster, they are semi-attached [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2610.42s)]
*  agencies like the Center for Strategic Research, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2616.14s)]
*  who in 2010 was actually, which in 2010 was actually [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2619.46s)]
*  headed by Rouhani and so what that starts to tell you [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2622.94s)]
*  is that this group in 2010, the oldest appearing group [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2626.34s)]
*  from the outset was targeting the Iranian government [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2630.62s)]
*  itself and if you take that forward, about nearly [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2632.82s)]
*  every single group that has been published on was actually [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2636.78s)]
*  also targeting Iranian government officials. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2639.82s)]
*  So the first group that we start looking at again [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2642.54s)]
*  is colloquially called Flying Kitten, it was published, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2645.3s)]
*  it was first published by FireEye [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2649.46s)]
*  and the Operation Zafron Rose Report and what was interesting [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2652.2200000000003s)]
*  is that that group which was targeting the aviation [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2655.82s)]
*  industry at the time, which was targeting Boeing [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2658.86s)]
*  and others had on repeated occasions attempted to steal [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2660.9s)]
*  the credentials, the passwords for Foreign Minister Zarif's [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2666.42s)]
*  Gmail account and you move forward, this is also [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2670.38s)]
*  this is occurring in early 2014, late 2013 at earliest, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2675.54s)]
*  this is in the middle of the nuclear negotiations [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2680.54s)]
*  and you move forward and everyone around Rouhani especially, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2684.58s)]
*  his immediate family members have clearly been targeted. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2690.06s)]
*  His brother Hussein Farydun who was I think potentially [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2693.98s)]
*  for political purposes targeted in a corruption trial [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2699.26s)]
*  but has clearly not necessarily been, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2702.14s)]
*  the hardline establishment has not been friendly with him, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2704.66s)]
*  not been happy about him, has been repeatedly targeted [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2708.7s)]
*  by spear phishing attempts. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2712.42s)]
*  You look forward and even we found cases in which [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2713.7s)]
*  actually the report has missed as early as this August, [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2717.1s)]
*  Zarif had once again been targeted by spear phishing [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2723.18s)]
*  and so what it appears is that even members [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2726.62s)]
*  of the government themselves are targeted. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2731.18s)]
*  You take sort of an outer shell of that, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2734.4199999999996s)]
*  if you move out a little bit more, [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2737.06s)]
*  reformist politicians are similarly targeted. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2738.7s)]
*  People who purport to ascribe to the tenants [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2742.02s)]
*  of the Islamic Republic are repeatedly the most commonly [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2745.62s)]
*  compromised targeted demographics. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2750.02s)]
*  We even saw some of Ahmadinejad's cabinet members [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2754.2599999999998s)]
*  being targeted in this process as well. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2758.7s)]
*  So I think that's been, it was very compelling [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2761.3399999999997s)]
*  to see how much it reflects the paranoia of the state [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2764.7s)]
*  in who they are targeting. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2768.9399999999996s)]
*  Is there any political faction that's not targeted? [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2770.7s)]
*  For instance, is there any cyber actor [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2773.74s)]
*  that's targeting IRGC generals? [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2777.4199999999996s)]
*  We don't necessarily see that but one of the questions [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2780.4199999999996s)]
*  that I've received is do you see this factionalism? [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2784.06s)]
*  So and again, Kareem can talk much more competently, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2787.34s)]
*  so my barely informed understanding is that the way [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2791.1800000000003s)]
*  that the power structure lies within the security apparatus [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2795.98s)]
*  is that the IRGC decidedly falls under the supreme leader. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2799.3s)]
*  The Ministry of Intelligence purports to fall under [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2805.02s)]
*  the president but the individual who's appointed [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2809.46s)]
*  is always a very hardline individual [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2815.2200000000003s)]
*  and so it's maybe the least controlled [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2819.14s)]
*  of all of the ministries. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2821.94s)]
*  And so one of the questions that I've received is [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2824.02s)]
*  do you see them hacking each other? [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2825.86s)]
*  And we don't necessarily see as much of the, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2827.86s)]
*  I have not seen as much of the Ministry of Intelligence side. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2831.66s)]
*  They actually seem to be more competent [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2834.34s)]
*  in their cyber actions and so I haven't seen [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2836.62s)]
*  as much of that activity. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2838.94s)]
*  I think that that would be awfully audacious [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2840.9s)]
*  if they're trying to hack the IRGC. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2843.5s)]
*  I wouldn't rule it out but we haven't necessarily. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2846.1s)]
*  They haven't tried to hack Khomeini's Gmail account. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2848.3s)]
*  I'm sure he has a Gmail account. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2851.54s)]
*  How does that strike you, Kareem? [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2854.26s)]
*  One thing I also noticed in the report is that [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2856.22s)]
*  while Iran has invested some amount of money into this, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2858.66s)]
*  the capabilities remain pretty third tier [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2861.94s)]
*  and whether that's because they just haven't given [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2865.26s)]
*  enough money or brain drain within Iran, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2867.58s)]
*  I mean can you identify some of those factors as well? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2869.54s)]
*  So this was another thing that I learned [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2871.66s)]
*  in the process of doing this with Colin [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2874.42s)]
*  that even a third tier cyber actor like Iran [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2876.8599999999997s)]
*  can be very effective by preying on fifth tier cyber actors. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2881.42s)]
*  So they may not be able to successfully hack Israel [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2884.8199999999997s)]
*  or the United States but Saudi Aramco is sitting around [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2888.3399999999997s)]
*  not really paying attention to these types of things [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2891.46s)]
*  and their attack on Aramco caused enormous damage. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2893.74s)]
*  One of the things I enjoyed in co-authoring the report [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2898.14s)]
*  was Colin would just sometimes say things [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2902.7s)]
*  to try to get me to understand something, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2906.46s)]
*  kind of a simple anecdote and I'd say, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2908.98s)]
*  yeah, that's actually incredibly informative [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2912.1s)]
*  and I remember one of the things he said was, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2914.7s)]
*  he was trying to explain to me that very simple methods [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2916.98s)]
*  can have huge consequences. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2919.22s)]
*  He said, well, the attack on the Democratic National Committee [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2920.94s)]
*  in 2016 was just a very simple phishing email, I guess, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2925.58s)]
*  to John Podesta and so that's what I think [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2929.38s)]
*  the Islamic Republic has done very well [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2932.82s)]
*  is preying on either individuals or companies or countries [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2936.34s)]
*  who really weren't focused on these things [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2940.34s)]
*  and now as a result, the rest of the world [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2943.58s)]
*  is much more focused and I guess this is a question [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2946.9s)]
*  for both Tim, your book has a chapter, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2948.98s)]
*  your forthcoming book has a chapter on Iran. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2952.34s)]
*  One of the things that I think about [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2954.62s)]
*  and I think US officials think about [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2956.98s)]
*  is kind of the double-edged sword of using cyber as a weapon [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2959.42s)]
*  because once you launch an attack like Stuxnet on Iran [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2962.66s)]
*  or very sophisticated cyber attacks, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2966.7s)]
*  it's a little different than conventional military attacks [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2968.62s)]
*  in that Iran can reverse engineer in some cases [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2971.94s)]
*  or better understand how these attacks were conceived, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2977.18s)]
*  learn from it and then use it as a tool themselves. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2981.46s)]
*  I'm curious whether that, I'm sure I've oversimplified that. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2984.7s)]
*  I think you point to a really important piece [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2988.1s)]
*  where if we take Stuxnet as an example [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2990.1s)]
*  and the code that was used during the operation [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2992.7400000000002s)]
*  was designed to only really unleash the damage [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2995.62s)]
*  in that specific system because it was tied [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=2999.54s)]
*  so that if it infected that system [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3001.78s)]
*  and that system was connected to another system, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3003.38s)]
*  another level of the code would be executed. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3005.1s)]
*  So the more sophisticated you are as an actor, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3009.46s)]
*  I think the more targeted you can be [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3011.82s)]
*  because you have the expertise, the knowledge [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3013.9s)]
*  and the level of sophistication [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3017.06s)]
*  to make your cyber weapon much more targeted. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3018.46s)]
*  If you are less sophisticated as an actor, [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3021.2200000000003s)]
*  be it Iran or for example North Korea, [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3023.34s)]
*  then you might still be able to cause [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3026.1s)]
*  a significant amount of damage [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3028.38s)]
*  because you're actually less sophisticated [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3029.94s)]
*  and don't have the knowledge and expertise [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3032.06s)]
*  to limit your harm only for the intended target. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3033.7s)]
*  So I think the WannaCry ransomware [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3036.66s)]
*  that we saw last year is a very good example of that [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3039.46s)]
*  where because so many of the systems remain unprotected, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3041.8199999999997s)]
*  most people don't use two-factor as you do, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3045.3399999999997s)]
*  there are so many low-hanging fruits [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3048.42s)]
*  that remain for even low-level actors [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3050.1s)]
*  to cause a significant amount of damage. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3054.46s)]
*  Another example is the blackout in Ukraine [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3056.8599999999997s)]
*  that occurred in 2015, December, or 2014, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3059.58s)]
*  I might be wrong on the year here. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3062.46s)]
*  But the damage that was caused by the malware, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3064.3s)]
*  through the outage, was not through the malware [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3067.34s)]
*  that was used, it was actually people [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3070.1000000000004s)]
*  having gained access to the systems [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3072.42s)]
*  and then using the legitimate credentials [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3073.86s)]
*  of the people operating the plant [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3075.7000000000003s)]
*  and then causing the blackout. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3078.86s)]
*  The malware that was used as part of the operation [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3080.78s)]
*  was only used to obfuscate what was happening [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3082.86s)]
*  and to delay the recovery of the system. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3085.38s)]
*  So again, the actual effect of taking the power out [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3088.3s)]
*  was the result of gaining access to legitimate credentials, [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3091.2200000000003s)]
*  and it wasn't because there was a super sophisticated [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3094.54s)]
*  malware that actually caused that effect. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3097.06s)]
*  And I think that's the worrisome trend [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3099.26s)]
*  that you have the ability for even a small [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3101.58s)]
*  or unsophisticated group of actors to cause harm [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3103.46s)]
*  if they have the intent to do so. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3106.18s)]
*  So I think we'll open it up for Q&A [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3108.82s)]
*  for questions from the audience. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3110.94s)]
*  So if we can have the mics, yes, this gentleman here. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3112.62s)]
*  And if you could identify yourself [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3119.42s)]
*  and what institution you're representing. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3121.34s)]
*  I'm from Rabangan. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3123.5800000000004s)]
*  My question is for Karim. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3124.78s)]
*  Regarding the signs of what happened in Iran [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3126.5s)]
*  in the last 10 days, had you and your, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3129.5400000000004s)]
*  let's say other people you know from different think tanks, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3133.9s)]
*  paid attention to the riots in places [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3137.7400000000002s)]
*  that were hit by water crisis, [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3142.2200000000003s)]
*  what we saw like in Ize, what we saw in Toy Sur Con, [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3145.86s)]
*  what we saw in Ahbaz, and all the places [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3148.5800000000004s)]
*  that people had gone to the streets [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3150.9s)]
*  for environmental problems like dust storms or water crisis. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3153.98s)]
*  And also there were people killed actually [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3159.02s)]
*  in the last two years in parts of Iran. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3162.1s)]
*  And some people had said that we will have problems [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3164.6600000000003s)]
*  of let's say hundreds of thousands or millions [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3168.2200000000003s)]
*  of my immigrants because of what the government [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3170.98s)]
*  has done in the last 20 something years. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3174.42s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3176.7400000000002s)]
*  So I've paid attention to it because I'm on your email list. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3177.6600000000003s)]
*  So I see what you've written about it and I read it. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3181.3399999999997s)]
*  And I think that in addition to the environmental crisis, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3183.2599999999998s)]
*  there was the recent earthquake in Kurdistan [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3186.9s)]
*  in which there was mass outrage [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3190.42s)]
*  at the colossal mismanagement and poor response measures. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3192.7799999999997s)]
*  Listen, to make a very, a much broader point, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3199.3399999999997s)]
*  one of the reports we authored at Carnegie a few years ago, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3202.02s)]
*  myself and Ali Vaz was looking at the economic cost [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3206.62s)]
*  of Iran's nuclear program. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3209.5s)]
*  And remember, we talked about that as well. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3210.74s)]
*  And this is a regime which has poured tens [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3213.9s)]
*  in the case of the nuclear program, [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3217.58s)]
*  hundreds of billions of dollars when you consider [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3219.26s)]
*  the ancillary costs, economic sanctions, et cetera, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3221.62s)]
*  for things which really don't have much return [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3225.54s)]
*  on investment. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3229.06s)]
*  The nuclear program can at best provide something [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3229.9s)]
*  like 2% of Iran's energy needs when about 16% [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3232.82s)]
*  of Iran's energy is lost because of faulty transmission lines. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3237.22s)]
*  And so whether it's pouring billions of dollars [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3240.74s)]
*  into the nuclear program, pouring billions of dollars [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3243.3799999999997s)]
*  into Bashar Assad or Shia militias or Hezbollah, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3245.8999999999996s)]
*  I think the chickens are coming home to roost. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3249.7s)]
*  And as we've seen in some of the slogans [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3252.8599999999997s)]
*  people are chanting, forget about Syria, think about us. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3255.54s)]
*  And these places in Iran which are most affected [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3258.7799999999997s)]
*  by mismanagement and environmental issues, [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3262.18s)]
*  whether it's because of poor water management [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3265.46s)]
*  or the building controls, it's astounding for me [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3269.9s)]
*  when I lived in Iran how it was actually a premium [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3274.46s)]
*  for people to live in buildings that were built [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3277.82s)]
*  before the revolution rather than post-revolution. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3279.98s)]
*  People wanted to live in buildings pre-1979 [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3282.5s)]
*  because they thought there was a more proper building code [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3286.2200000000003s)]
*  than those were built post-revolution. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3289.66s)]
*  So I think this is going to be, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3292.06s)]
*  it's one of those, the issue you raise, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3295.14s)]
*  environmental issues. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3298.98s)]
*  And in a month ago, a month before in the month of December [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3299.94s)]
*  I co-authored a report on Iran's demographics. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3303.86s)]
*  And it's a country which is much older [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3306.74s)]
*  than many of its regional peers. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3311.62s)]
*  And they're totally not prepared for the future [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3313.54s)]
*  of an older aging society [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3315.82s)]
*  and higher reform pension systems. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3317.58s)]
*  And I think the challenge the Islamic Republic has [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3319.58s)]
*  is that the leadership, the leader is 77, 78 years old. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3322.2999999999997s)]
*  He's so focused on near term crises [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3326.38s)]
*  and just making sure he dies as supreme leader [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3329.42s)]
*  that these colossal monumental issues [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3332.54s)]
*  like the country's natural resources, water issues, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3335.06s)]
*  earthquake, there's an incredible statistic I once heard [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3338.98s)]
*  when I was living in Iran after the Bam earthquake. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3342.62s)]
*  The British embassy did a study [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3345.66s)]
*  from a British seismologist who estimated [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3347.26s)]
*  there was upwards of 97 or 90% chance of an earthquake [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3350.7000000000003s)]
*  over seven on the Richter scale in the city of Tehran. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3355.42s)]
*  Now that could be one of the great natural disasters [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3358.34s)]
*  of modern times, but I have no indication [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3362.1400000000003s)]
*  that the leadership in Iran is focused on these issues [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3364.46s)]
*  because they're focused on how do we keep Assad in power? [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3368.2200000000003s)]
*  How do we project our power regionally? [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3372.5800000000004s)]
*  How do we suppress an internal insurrection? [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3375.1s)]
*  Another question from the audience? [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3380.22s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3383.46s)]
*  I'm Mike Nelson with Cloudflare. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3387.02s)]
*  This is a question primarily to Colin. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3390.42s)]
*  Those of us in cybersecurity industry know [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3393.42s)]
*  that you have to worry about confidentiality, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3396.14s)]
*  integrity, and availability. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3398.8199999999997s)]
*  And most discussions about Iran focus on theft of data [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3401.34s)]
*  and DDoS attacks. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3405.54s)]
*  We don't hear a lot about attacks designed [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3407.1000000000004s)]
*  to manipulate databases, whether it's bank records [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3410.1400000000003s)]
*  or hospital records or some other critical data set, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3414.0600000000004s)]
*  which if altered could really undermine trust [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3419.2200000000003s)]
*  in institutions. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3422.38s)]
*  I'm just curious, Colin or anyone else, [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3423.7000000000003s)]
*  whether there's been any indication [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3425.6200000000003s)]
*  that the Iranians are trying to do this kind [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3427.1800000000003s)]
*  of undermining of institutions, not by stealing data, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3429.98s)]
*  but by altering it and maybe deleting every fifth character [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3433.78s)]
*  or something? [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3437.86s)]
*  Well, I would maybe take a step back further [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3439.7000000000003s)]
*  in the sort of chain of progression, [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3443.1800000000003s)]
*  and I would say one of the things that I was looking for, [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3445.3s)]
*  and I thought that I would see, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3449.26s)]
*  is Iran engaging more in information operations. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3451.3s)]
*  I was really convinced that what Russia did [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3455.22s)]
*  during the US election would inspire Iranian groups [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3460.2999999999997s)]
*  to engage in the same behavior [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3465.8199999999997s)]
*  during the Iranian presidential election last May, [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3467.3799999999997s)]
*  especially since it's clear that those people [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3471.8199999999997s)]
*  have been targeted, it's clear that a number of people [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3474.3399999999997s)]
*  in Rouhani's circle have even been compromised. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3476.8999999999996s)]
*  And so clearly they must have some sort [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3482.14s)]
*  of embarrassing material about members [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3483.98s)]
*  of Rouhani's inner circle. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3486.78s)]
*  I was thoroughly convinced that you would see [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3489.26s)]
*  some sort of operation to that effect, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3490.9s)]
*  but you actually hadn't. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3494.06s)]
*  And I'm surprised that despite clear indication [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3495.78s)]
*  that a number of organizations, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3501.0s)]
*  such as opposition organizations outside of the country, [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3503.1s)]
*  have been compromised, that you haven't seen the leaks [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3506.86s)]
*  of embarrassing material or this sort of behavior. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3509.9s)]
*  And I think that I would be looking for that first. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3514.94s)]
*  I would be looking for them to start to instrumentalize [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3518.42s)]
*  and weaponize information before they started to get [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3521.98s)]
*  into more subtle forms of coercive campaigns. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3524.98s)]
*  And that just hasn't seemed to have occurred. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3531.62s)]
*  I don't know if the issue is intent or capacity. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3535.3s)]
*  I could certainly understand that the Iranians [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3539.96s)]
*  are less likely to attempt to do that [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3541.9s)]
*  or be able to do that towards the United States [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3543.78s)]
*  because what is clear is that Iran doesn't seem [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3546.46s)]
*  to understand that actually hacking requires [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3550.5s)]
*  human resources as much as technical resources. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3553.78s)]
*  There are times in which Iran seems to get [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3557.62s)]
*  to a certain level of sophistication, which is respectable, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3559.6600000000003s)]
*  engages in certain attacks which are credibly complex, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3564.82s)]
*  and then they're entirely betrayed by the fact [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3570.42s)]
*  that the attackers speak terrible English. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3573.6600000000003s)]
*  They're like beautiful, well-written malware, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3577.6600000000003s)]
*  and it's like, please, dear open attachment, [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3580.82s)]
*  thank you, goodbye, have a nice day, yours, love, truly. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3583.7000000000003s)]
*  All of it misspelled. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3587.9s)]
*  All of it misspelled, grammatically strange. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3590.02s)]
*  For some reason, enough hubris to think that they could try, [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3594.3s)]
*  don't go to Google Translate and end up worse. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3598.18s)]
*  And so they're better at attacking Iranians [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3602.8599999999997s)]
*  than they are other people because they know Iranians, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3606.62s)]
*  at least, and so that to me says that they would be [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3609.06s)]
*  less likely to be able to pull off something [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3612.3399999999997s)]
*  like the DNC attacks, the attacks against [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3614.58s)]
*  the Democratic Party because they don't understand [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3618.94s)]
*  the human resource issues. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3621.2599999999998s)]
*  And so I do think that there is at least a limit [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3623.2599999999998s)]
*  of capacity in that they haven't made [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3625.74s)]
*  that investment thus far. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3627.9s)]
*  But in terms of domestic audiences, [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3629.94s)]
*  maybe I'm accidentally inspiring them, [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3632.7s)]
*  maybe I'm challenging them, I apologize. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3634.74s)]
*  But I'm surprised that they at least haven't come that far, [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3638.2599999999998s)]
*  let alone these sort of more subtle degradation attempts. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3640.62s)]
*  Just to add two points on that, [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3644.86s)]
*  Iran is also a really good case study for, I think, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3646.94s)]
*  how the government used its offensive cyber tools [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3648.7799999999997s)]
*  as part of the broader political game and context [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3652.54s)]
*  that was being played, be it the negotiations for the JCPOA [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3654.9s)]
*  and others, so I think there's always the question, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3658.06s)]
*  what would actually be the incentive for Tehran [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3659.98s)]
*  to conduct these more coercive effects, [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3662.7000000000003s)]
*  especially given where we are currently [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3666.14s)]
*  in the political environment and the relationship with the US. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3667.7400000000002s)]
*  And the second thing that I would add is, [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3670.5s)]
*  actually it's something that we at CARNI, [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3672.98s)]
*  at the Cyber Policy Initiative, are very concerned about, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3674.46s)]
*  and we have a project dedicated to the integrity [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3677.1800000000003s)]
*  of financial data because we think it's something [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3679.2200000000003s)]
*  that might be coming down the pipe in the next five [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3681.46s)]
*  to 10 years and that we should be focusing on it. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3683.34s)]
*  But as Colin just said, right now we are still in the, [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3685.9s)]
*  not comfortable, but in the position [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3688.86s)]
*  that we haven't seen this yet, but we have, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3690.2200000000003s)]
*  it's limited to data breaches and DDoS attacks [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3693.38s)]
*  with regard to Iran. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3695.98s)]
*  Oh yeah, sir. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3698.1000000000004s)]
*  Thank you, Patrick Tucker with Defense One. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3704.82s)]
*  I wonder, two questions, I wonder if briefly [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3706.78s)]
*  you could describe whether or not you observed any change [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3708.7000000000003s)]
*  in Iranian cyber activity following the March 2016 [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3711.5s)]
*  Justice Department indictments of seven Iranians [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3715.78s)]
*  for particular cyber activity that we ruled to be illegal. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3719.18s)]
*  Was that, did the activity increase? [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3723.5s)]
*  Basically, did sanctions have any effect [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3726.22s)]
*  on what they were doing? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3727.78s)]
*  And the second question is, if you've seen the Quds Force [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3728.94s)]
*  use any of these tactics to any degree, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3731.98s)]
*  does that differ from the way the rest [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3734.66s)]
*  of the government uses them, thanks? [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3735.94s)]
*  So I would, I think that would be, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3738.66s)]
*  on the first question with regard to whether [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3741.3399999999997s)]
*  these indictments have deterred Iran or not, [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3743.8599999999997s)]
*  I think it's difficult to tell. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3747.02s)]
*  I think that we tried to take as broad of a possible view [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3748.58s)]
*  in terms of the behaviors and the activity, [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3752.9399999999996s)]
*  but it's very difficult to understand internally [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3756.4199999999996s)]
*  the calculation, whether somebody decided not [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3759.02s)]
*  to do something because there was a concern [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3761.74s)]
*  about an indictment. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3763.58s)]
*  I think that this also takes place within the context of, [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3764.46s)]
*  we certainly say that after the JCPOA, [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3768.86s)]
*  and certainly during the negotiations as well, [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3772.86s)]
*  that there's overall been a decline [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3775.46s)]
*  in disruptive attacks towards Iran and from Iran. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3777.94s)]
*  And so that seems to be really the overriding [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3783.34s)]
*  political event that is shaping the nature [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3786.1s)]
*  of Iranian behavior rather than the indictments [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3789.1s)]
*  that we've heard. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3791.26s)]
*  So I think that's the nature of Iranian behavior [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3792.14s)]
*  rather than the indictments itself. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3793.46s)]
*  What I would be interested in, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3795.54s)]
*  which I don't think that we'll ever really know, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3797.7799999999997s)]
*  is at least on a personal basis, [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3800.02s)]
*  how has that shaped the decisions of individuals [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3802.9s)]
*  to participate in these campaigns? [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3806.62s)]
*  Do the indictments stop people [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3808.94s)]
*  from working for the government? [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3811.22s)]
*  Have they withdrawn? [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3814.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't think that we have, [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3815.7799999999997s)]
*  at least I haven't seen a direct insight [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3816.9s)]
*  into the seven individuals that were indicted [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3820.86s)]
*  and whether they have continued to engage in certain actions. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3824.1800000000003s)]
*  We certainly see that often when people [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3828.6200000000003s)]
*  have been published upon, [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3831.1s)]
*  that they tend to disband or change their operations, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3835.6200000000003s)]
*  that it does in some way affect their calculation. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3838.6600000000003s)]
*  But we don't necessarily understand to what extent, [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3843.1400000000003s)]
*  whether they go away completely, [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3846.6600000000003s)]
*  and whether certain people just have not participated [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3849.5s)]
*  just because they are now fearful of being indicted, [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3853.74s)]
*  that they want to emigrate, for example, [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3856.5s)]
*  and they know that if they are named in an indictment, [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3858.7799999999997s)]
*  that they won't be able to immigrate from the country. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3861.74s)]
*  On the second case, [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3865.22s)]
*  I think that one of our primary contributions [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3867.8599999999997s)]
*  is that we use, [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3871.7799999999997s)]
*  that I think that makes the most clear case [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3874.2599999999998s)]
*  for an affiliation between these groups [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3877.26s)]
*  and the Revolutionary Guard. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3880.26s)]
*  And we do so based off of a particular insight [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3883.2200000000003s)]
*  that only civil society has, [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3887.0200000000004s)]
*  which is the direct consequences to individuals [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3889.1000000000004s)]
*  as a result of this hacking and the relationship [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3892.9s)]
*  that Karim described with CMAC Nomine C, [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3895.82s)]
*  of people being arrested and attacks being launched [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3898.5800000000004s)]
*  from their accounts that can be directly tied [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3902.98s)]
*  to known threat actors. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3905.22s)]
*  Those often seem to be, my guess has been, [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3908.7s)]
*  although there's not a level of confidence [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3911.8199999999997s)]
*  that this is said in the paper, [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3914.62s)]
*  my guess is that this is intelligence parts of the IRGC, [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3916.14s)]
*  but we don't go to a certain extent to say [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3919.98s)]
*  that this is affiliated or asked, [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3923.14s)]
*  requested by the Cliffs Force [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3926.8199999999997s)]
*  that this is aligned with certain segments of the IRGC. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3928.3799999999997s)]
*  We just sort of make a broader attribution [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3931.3799999999997s)]
*  to the Revolutionary Guard. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3934.58s)]
*  Any other questions from the audience? [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3937.98s)]
*  Yes, sir, back there. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3940.8599999999997s)]
*  We've seen them use DDoS. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3947.06s)]
*  Sorry, can you identify yourself? [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3949.02s)]
*  John Hockeson from FireEye. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3950.62s)]
*  We've seen Iranian actors use DDoS in the past [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3951.7s)]
*  with Operation Ababil. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3955.1s)]
*  I wonder if we've seen anything more recently [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3956.8599999999997s)]
*  in the domestic sphere, [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3959.62s)]
*  especially to maybe knock out opposition media [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3961.58s)]
*  or something hosted outside of the country. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3964.58s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great question. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3968.86s)]
*  I've been interested in that especially because [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3970.9s)]
*  at the same time that you saw denial of service attacks [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3973.7799999999997s)]
*  being used disruptively against [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3976.62s)]
*  American banking institutions, [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3979.38s)]
*  you see a number of reports that say, [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3980.98s)]
*  or cases in which they were used against [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3984.34s)]
*  Persian language social media platforms, [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3986.74s)]
*  Persian language independent media sites. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3990.8599999999997s)]
*  The BBC in 2012 disclosed that they were the subject [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3994.54s)]
*  of a denial of service attack that they attributed to Iran [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=3997.98s)]
*  timed with the exact same day [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4001.14s)]
*  as the 2012 parliamentary election. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4002.74s)]
*  You've seen other cases where even, for example, [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4005.58s)]
*  the Mujahideen, the MEK said that in tandem with attacks [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4009.58s)]
*  against their location in Iraq, [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4013.82s)]
*  which they linked with Shia militants, [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4017.02s)]
*  there was also denial of service attacks [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4019.02s)]
*  against their properties. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4021.1000000000004s)]
*  You've seen this really consistently. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4022.38s)]
*  What has been interesting is I've reached out to a number [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4024.5800000000004s)]
*  of those people that were the subject of attacks [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4027.7000000000003s)]
*  and asked them if they had seen anything since 2014, 2015, [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4030.7400000000002s)]
*  and they actually hadn't seen much at all. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4035.38s)]
*  And what I attribute that to is that, again, [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4038.82s)]
*  in terms of investment of resources [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4041.62s)]
*  under the Internet Freedom Agenda [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4043.22s)]
*  and in coordinating private sector contributions, [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4044.7799999999997s)]
*  this is a place in which we've actually excelled. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4048.14s)]
*  And so there are a number of resources free or paid for [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4051.66s)]
*  by development agencies to protect against [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4056.58s)]
*  denial of service attacks. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4059.74s)]
*  And a lot of those platforms that were targeted [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4061.2599999999998s)]
*  now have either free Cloudflare services, [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4064.3399999999997s)]
*  Google's Deflect service, or Google's, oh no, [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4069.38s)]

*  Shield, thank you. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4076.86s)]
*  His competitor too. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4078.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4080.1400000000003s)]
*  It's very generous. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4080.98s)]
*  Or civil society organized efforts [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4085.46s)]
*  such as the Deflect network. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4089.6600000000003s)]
*  And those have been very effective at fending off [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4091.7400000000002s)]
*  the level of attacks that Iranians are capable of. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4095.34s)]
*  And I think that actually that improvement of defense [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4098.66s)]
*  has overall disincentivized from Iranians [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4101.82s)]
*  from believing that that's a useful way [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4106.5s)]
*  of knocking people offline. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4108.78s)]
*  Just to extend my answer a little bit too far, [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4110.86s)]
*  the reason why that was especially effective [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4114.9s)]
*  was that the platforms that were being [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4117.5s)]
*  denial of service attacked [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4121.34s)]
*  were often still forced to pay for the bills. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4123.0199999999995s)]
*  And so what you'd have is somebody would be DDoSed [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4126.54s)]
*  and they'd either face a choice. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4129.7s)]
*  I'm either gonna get a $5,000 Amazon bill [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4131.14s)]
*  or I'm going to turn my services off [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4134.3s)]
*  until I think that they've gotten bored. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4136.9s)]
*  And so people will stay down for multiple days [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4141.9s)]
*  after a five minute denial of service attack. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4144.18s)]
*  So it's just even the threat of a DDoS that was effective. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4146.5s)]
*  And so since we've shifted that [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4150.5s)]
*  and we've been able to provide those resources, [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4152.14s)]
*  you just haven't seen that anymore. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4154.5s)]
*  You make the interesting point in the report [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4157.46s)]
*  that Iranian civil society and their internal targets [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4160.06s)]
*  are often sort of the canary in the coal mine [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4164.42s)]
*  for where Iranian threat actors are going to look next [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4166.54s)]
*  and what the methods that they're going to use. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4170.54s)]
*  And so the private sector and the potential targets [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4172.54s)]
*  in the West and in the Gulf would do well [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4176.82s)]
*  to sort of pay close attention to the attacks [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4179.06s)]
*  that happen against Iran's civil society. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4182.58s)]
*  Yes. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4184.62s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4186.5s)]
*  Hello, I'm Makram Rabah. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4192.3s)]
*  I'm a lecturer at the American University of Beirut. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4193.42s)]
*  Actually, I'm interested in two aspects. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4195.94s)]
*  One aspect we saw Hassan Nasrallah recently disclose [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4197.94s)]
*  his salary in a way to appease these voices [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4201.42s)]
*  calling for Iranian taxpayers' money going to Hezbollah. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4205.5s)]
*  You think that this would actually resonate [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4209.18s)]
*  with these people. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4211.18s)]
*  Second, and more importantly, the counterterrorism [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4212.62s)]
*  for these cyber attacks. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4215.38s)]
*  I feel that, be it the American administration [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4217.1s)]
*  or even Google, they are playing too nice. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4219.38s)]
*  So they have a lot of restrictions. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4222.18s)]
*  When they were trying to counter ISIS, [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4223.700000000001s)]
*  they had so much restrictions on these counter messaging [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4225.860000000001s)]
*  that it was ridiculous. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4228.900000000001s)]
*  You couldn't use blood, you couldn't use violence. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4229.860000000001s)]
*  And we know that initially in the Syrian revolution, [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4232.34s)]
*  when the revolutionaries used cyber attacks [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4235.1s)]
*  against Bashar al-Assad and they got their hands [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4238.74s)]
*  on these pictures of, they say it's one of his assistants [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4242.74s)]
*  sending him nude pictures, it had a huge effect on his image. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4247.78s)]
*  So why don't we see people reacting, [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4251.58s)]
*  individuals going after these people in Shiraz [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4254.54s)]
*  and actually putting up a real fight instead of telling us [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4258.0599999999995s)]
*  they want to counter these messages and do nothing about? [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4260.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4263.62s)]
*  Should take it first. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4264.54s)]
*  I can maybe take a little bit of the second part. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4267.1s)]
*  One of the challenges is how do you not only defensively [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4272.06s)]
*  but actively confront these attacks against activists? [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4275.66s)]
*  The reality is that the people that are conducting it [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4279.3s)]
*  are random individuals. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4282.22s)]
*  And so there's not a lot of surface for retaliation [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4284.58s)]
*  against the attackers themselves. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4287.18s)]
*  Similarly, if you broaden the scope of if you were [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4289.38s)]
*  to engage in some sort of active measures campaign, [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4292.3s)]
*  the hardline establishment has been very effective [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4298.18s)]
*  at staying technologically behind for strategic purposes. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4301.38s)]
*  I don't think that there's a lot of as much [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4306.54s)]
*  infrastructure exposed to embarrass them [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4309.54s)]
*  through retaliating. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4313.38s)]
*  And so what you've seen instead is an emphasis [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4315.3s)]
*  and a focus on the defensive aspect of it, [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4317.78s)]
*  making sure that people are secure. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4320.58s)]
*  And I think that we have been very effective again [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4322.9800000000005s)]
*  at providing the tools for the dissidents [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4325.780000000001s)]
*  that are being attacked to protect themselves. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4328.14s)]
*  Why won't they treat the attackers [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4333.5s)]
*  as a threat to their future? [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4336.1s)]
*  For effective and they have the right? [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4345.58s)]
*  But the problem in this case is that one of the things [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4347.5s)]
*  that attackers are able to exploit is the fact [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4350.7s)]
*  that the internet is open and decentralized. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4353.34s)]
*  And so when you start to look at the things [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4357.139999999999s)]
*  in which you could potentially curtail individuals [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4359.099999999999s)]
*  that have a malicious intent, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4362.0599999999995s)]
*  you start to look at the sort of measures [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4364.22s)]
*  and organization of the internet. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4368.34s)]
*  Tim can maybe speak more articulately about this. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4369.78s)]
*  You start to envision a model of the internet [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4373.26s)]
*  that is the one espoused by China and Russia. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4376.179999999999s)]
*  If you want to absolutely control all of the attacks [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4379.58s)]
*  that occur on the internet, [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4384.94s)]
*  you're going to have to start to close down the internet. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4385.94s)]
*  If you even wanted to, [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4389.26s)]
*  if we talk about using sanctions [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4392.22s)]
*  to deter Iranians, for example, [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4393.78s)]
*  the reality is that if you look back at the person who, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4395.86s)]
*  there was a case in which there was a Dutch security company [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4399.78s)]
*  that was compromised by Iranians, [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4403.3s)]
*  and in order to issue fake certificates [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4405.94s)]
*  to impersonate Google, [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4409.299999999999s)]
*  to spy on basically all Gmail users inside of the country. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4410.78s)]
*  This was an incredibly consequential attack. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4414.379999999999s)]
*  And the fundamental resources that were used [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4417.66s)]
*  to orchestrate the attack were servers outside [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4422.099999999999s)]
*  of the country paid for by a stolen Israeli credit card. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4425.379999999999s)]
*  And so even if you wanted to go to such an extreme [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4431.2s)]
*  that you were to cut Iran off of most platforms, [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4433.98s)]
*  you still wouldn't be able to [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4438.099999999999s)]
*  because malicious actors are going to be malicious actors. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4439.62s)]
*  And until we start to change the model of the internet [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4442.719999999999s)]
*  that we all appreciate and love and take advantage of, [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4446.179999999999s)]
*  they're also going to take advantage [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4449.179999999999s)]
*  of that model as well. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4450.86s)]
*  Can I just address the Hezbollah question? [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4453.0599999999995s)]
*  I read Nasrallah's speech last night, [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4455.78s)]
*  and for context, several, [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4458.139999999999s)]
*  I think it was several months ago, [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4461.0199999999995s)]
*  Nasrallah was asked about the risk [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4462.62s)]
*  of US sanctions against Hezbollah. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4464.62s)]
*  And he said, all of our resources come from Iran. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4468.099999999999s)]
*  All of our resources come from Iran, [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4472.0199999999995s)]
*  and so therefore we're impervious to US sanctions. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4474.0599999999995s)]
*  In the speech in the last 48 hours, [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4476.86s)]
*  he said he was significantly downplaying the support [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4479.5s)]
*  that Hezbollah got from Iran, [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4483.88s)]
*  and particularly his salary, [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4485.099999999999s)]
*  he said I only get a salary of about $1,300 a month. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4487.14s)]
*  And he also went on to say [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4493.62s)]
*  that the people in the streets shouting, [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4495.7s)]
*  forget about Syria, think about us, [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4500.46s)]
*  forget about Hezbollah, think about us. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4502.38s)]
*  These are just a very, very small minority of Iranians, [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4504.22s)]
*  and the vast majority of Iranians [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4507.42s)]
*  do support Iran's support for Hezbollah [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4509.34s)]
*  and its foreign wars. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4511.7s)]
*  Couple of things I'd say. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4514.18s)]
*  One is that there, I would argue, [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4515.0s)]
*  are far more people who resent Iran's [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4518.02s)]
*  external spending on Arab wars [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4523.22s)]
*  than the folks we saw in the streets, [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4526.18s)]
*  and this is a long-time phenomenon. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4528.02s)]
*  You hear this, this has actually been reported [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4530.06s)]
*  for some time, including at the recent earthquake sites, [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4533.14s)]
*  people saying that if this earthquake had happened [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4536.900000000001s)]
*  in south Lebanon, the government would have been [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4539.34s)]
*  much quicker to react than it had happened [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4541.02s)]
*  in Iranian Kurdistan. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4542.900000000001s)]
*  I think if you look at the Islamic Republic, [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4544.9s)]
*  it has been the highest exodus of Iranians from Iran [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4550.42s)]
*  in probably the 2,500-year history of Iran, [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4555.78s)]
*  the people who have left Iran post-1979. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4559.38s)]
*  And I think what many people resent, [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4562.62s)]
*  and I have to say myself included, [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4565.62s)]
*  is that you do have lots of Arab Shiites [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4567.7s)]
*  who have open access to Iran, and they go back and forth, [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4573.34s)]
*  and some of these are Arab Shiite journalists [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4576.66s)]
*  who work for Hezbollah news services, [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4579.7s)]
*  and they are operating also in the Western realm, [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4581.42s)]
*  writing pieces for our monitor and elsewhere. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4584.22s)]
*  And you have an individual like Siomak Namazi [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4587.3s)]
*  and his father, Baqir Namazi, who if anyone knows them, [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4590.9s)]
*  are really the embodiment of Iranian patriots. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4594.099999999999s)]
*  They're languishing in Evin Prison, [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4598.0599999999995s)]
*  and you have others who are not even Iranians [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4600.46s)]
*  who are able to go back and forth through the country. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4603.62s)]
*  So I do think one of the battles in Iran today [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4606.1s)]
*  is between the forces of Persian nationalism [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4610.7s)]
*  and Shiite nationalism. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4613.38s)]
*  It goes back in some ways to what Kissinger said, [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4615.02s)]
*  is Iran a nation or a cause? [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4617.26s)]
*  And I would argue that many amongst the younger generation [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4619.3s)]
*  of Iranians want Iran to be a nation state [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4621.9800000000005s)]
*  which puts its national interests [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4624.3s)]
*  before revolutionary ideology. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4625.78s)]
*  And when you look at things through that prism, [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4628.14s)]
*  spending tens of billions of dollars on Bashar Assad [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4630.860000000001s)]
*  in order to be part of the resistance against Palestine [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4635.62s)]
*  doesn't make a whole lot of sense [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4639.740000000001s)]
*  in the context of national interests. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4641.1s)]
*  A few more, yes, the woman in the back. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4644.3s)]
*  My name is Tove Eibash, I'm with the Department of Defense. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4652.22s)]
*  You mentioned earlier in the conversation [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4656.06s)]
*  a lack of resources, of human resources. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4658.740000000001s)]
*  Do you see any correlations or attempts [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4661.660000000001s)]
*  at active recruitment within the computer programs [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4664.54s)]
*  in the universities, straight into cyber programs [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4669.740000000001s)]
*  or straight into the military? [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4674.9800000000005s)]
*  And do you see any indications of a willingness [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4676.42s)]
*  to spend more money on this recruitment [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4680.1s)]
*  and a willingness to train people? [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4682.5s)]
*  Some of that is hard to see externally. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4687.06s)]
*  I think that you can start to see fragments of that. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4689.820000000001s)]
*  Firstly, one thing to keep in mind is that [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4692.9800000000005s)]
*  we aren't able to find any cases in which [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4695.38s)]
*  the attacks that we're talking about [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4699.1s)]
*  are conducted by members of the military establishment itself. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4700.860000000001s)]
*  So there's a sort of recruitment, [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4706.22s)]
*  but it's sort of a public-private initiative, [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4707.700000000001s)]
*  this cyber warfare. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4711.02s)]
*  But that being said, you see an increase in investments, [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4713.22s)]
*  but those are not necessarily proportional [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4719.22s)]
*  to what you would expect for a country like Iran. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4721.66s)]
*  And so there was, for example, [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4725.02s)]
*  Rouhani increased the budget for cybersecurity, [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4726.820000000001s)]
*  and there was a lot of attention to the fact [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4730.06s)]
*  that it was like a 1,700% increase in a budget. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4732.02s)]
*  But Iran still, that was an increase from maybe like [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4738.58s)]
*  a couple million dollars to tens of millions of dollars, [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4741.740000000001s)]
*  whereas an American bank alone spent something like [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4746.02s)]
*  hundreds of million dollars on information security [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4749.5s)]
*  and in cybersecurity. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4754.1s)]
*  Iran's investments have been actually fairly minimal [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4756.18s)]
*  for a country of 80 million that have been [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4759.5s)]
*  systemically compromised for purposes of coercion [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4763.18s)]
*  and espionage. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4766.58s)]
*  And so there is still this, one of the things [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4769.74s)]
*  that I'm just surprised is that they actually [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4771.98s)]
*  are much further behind than they should be. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4775.26s)]
*  Why haven't they invested more? [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4777.42s)]
*  You've seen an attempt at fostering [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4779.78s)]
*  a more professional information security community, [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4783.5s)]
*  certainly you see an increase of events [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4786.66s)]
*  such as capture the flag tournaments [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4790.179999999999s)]
*  in Iranian universities. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4792.5s)]
*  You do see more cybersecurity programs within the country. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4794.9s)]
*  You see a greater emphasis by the cyber police [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4799.3s)]
*  on issues of fraud and personal security [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4802.42s)]
*  and other sorts of economic crime. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4806.5s)]
*  So what I would say is that I would say [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4809.62s)]
*  certainly Iran is getting better, but incrementally so, [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4812.18s)]
*  and you don't see the sort of investment [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4816.820000000001s)]
*  that would be proportionate to what you would expect [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4819.18s)]
*  a more mature country where they would be at. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4822.42s)]
*  And the gulf between the two I think is substantial, [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4825.94s)]
*  and I think it will take years, and I [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4830.74s)]
*  think it'll take a greater focus in order to get there. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4832.7s)]
*  I think we have time for one last question, [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4837.46s)]
*  if anyone has one. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4839.5s)]
*  Yes, this woman here. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4841.179999999999s)]
*  You, ma'am, in the sort of middle section. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4843.9s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4851.74s)]
*  Elise Goss Alexander with the US Commission [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4852.94s)]
*  on International Religious Freedom. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4855.3s)]
*  You had mentioned earlier the two points [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4857.9400000000005s)]
*  about the ongoing bipartisan support for the internet [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4859.9800000000005s)]
*  freedom agenda and about clarifying OFAC licenses [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4863.14s)]
*  and stuff. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4866.46s)]
*  I was just wondering if you had any other specific policy [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4867.02s)]
*  recommendations based on this report? [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4869.5s)]
*  Well, your affiliation was what exactly? [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4876.74s)]
*  Yes. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4882.54s)]
*  OK, the reason why I ask is that one of the things we talk [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4885.04s)]
*  about, I know it's a beast of a report, [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4887.62s)]
*  and you probably haven't gotten to the end of it [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4889.38s)]
*  yet because it just came out. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4891.179999999999s)]
*  But in the end, we do talk about some [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4892.38s)]
*  of the attacks on religious minorities, [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4895.0199999999995s)]
*  including religious Baha'i minorities, [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4898.98s)]
*  Iranian Baha'i minorities in the US. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4901.62s)]
*  And you do talk about some of the policy prescriptions [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4904.139999999999s)]
*  that they're not JP Morgan. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4907.74s)]
*  They can't afford to hire Palantir [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4911.38s)]
*  and pay them tens of thousands of dollars a month [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4913.7s)]
*  to protect them. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4915.9800000000005s)]
*  And so one of the things that Colin talks about [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4917.42s)]
*  is that it's important we think about policies and measures [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4919.5s)]
*  to protect these organizations who are smaller fish, [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4923.22s)]
*  have much more minor resources, but are oftentimes [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4930.18s)]
*  the first warning of what's to come. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4935.02s)]
*  Because as we've talked about, same groups that are hacking [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4937.14s)]
*  or going after Baha'i organizations in the US [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4940.34s)]
*  are oftentimes the same folks going after Aramco [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4943.82s)]
*  or going after infrastructure sites in the US. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4946.7s)]
*  I would say one of the problems that we run into, [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4949.900000000001s)]
*  and with the Baha'i, there's a specific case, actually, [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4952.9400000000005s)]
*  which I think is extraordinary, which [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4956.74s)]
*  is that in March 2014, there was a disclosure [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4958.4400000000005s)]
*  of a widespread espionage campaign that [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4962.74s)]
*  was very good at building up a social media presence [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4965.62s)]
*  that looked legitimate in order to conduct espionage [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4970.22s)]
*  against the defendant sector. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4973.1s)]
*  And there was an FBI report that followed a private sector [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4975.1s)]
*  report by EyeSight. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4978.42s)]
*  There was an FBI bulletin that listed actually the profiles [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4979.860000000001s)]
*  that were involved in order to allow companies [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4983.46s)]
*  to see if they were affected, potentially targeted, [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4986.18s)]
*  and respond to it. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4988.9800000000005s)]
*  So this was a set of Facebook profiles, [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4990.42s)]
*  a set of LinkedIn profiles. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4993.18s)]
*  What was interesting about that is [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4995.06s)]
*  that the private sector report had put out [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=4996.740000000001s)]
*  10 profile names. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5000.18s)]
*  The FBI had put out something like 46, 52. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5001.34s)]
*  And in about 40 of those names had been actually Persian names. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5005.860000000001s)]
*  And you think about it, it's like, [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5011.34s)]
*  who's going to try to spearfish the defense [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5012.700000000001s)]
*  sector with a Persian Iranian identity? [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5014.62s)]
*  And the reason why that is is that actually you go back [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5018.34s)]
*  and one of those, this was reported, [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5020.54s)]
*  one of those fake profiles was actually impersonating [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5024.02s)]
*  Ambassador Bolton. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5026.900000000001s)]
*  And that fictitious Ambassador Bolton profile [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5028.64s)]
*  had actually targeted a senior member of the Baha'i [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5032.04s)]
*  establishment. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5035.280000000001s)]
*  It was a John Bolton LinkedIn profile, wasn't it? [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5036.240000000001s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5038.6s)]
*  Also great English, terrible English. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5040.360000000001s)]
*  Good profile, terrible English. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5044.76s)]
*  And what I found was that this was a really stark example [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5047.6s)]
*  of how much there's a difference of opportunity [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5055.08s)]
*  for organizations in protecting itself. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5058.76s)]
*  That the private sector had released this very well [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5061.36s)]
*  composed, they're not always well composed, [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5065.4s)]
*  but this was well composed piece of information [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5067.36s)]
*  on protecting yourself against attacks. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5070.28s)]
*  And civil society was never given access to this. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5072.76s)]
*  This was privately held until it leaked to a site. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5075.2s)]
*  And I think that this shows that the differences when [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5079.28s)]
*  civil society are left out of the conversation, [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5082.44s)]
*  that the FBI could have extended that opportunity. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5085.16s)]
*  The document was going to leak anyway. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5088.08s)]
*  One of those organizations was probably hacked. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5089.839999999999s)]
*  The hackers were going to get it anyway. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5092.0s)]
*  But by sheer virtue of not including civil society [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5095.36s)]
*  or giving them the resources, they [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5098.5599999999995s)]
*  were less capable of defending themselves [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5100.08s)]
*  against this very consequential campaign. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5102.24s)]
*  I think that there is opportunities [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5105.839999999999s)]
*  for the private sector to invest more [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5108.0s)]
*  in making available resources for securing their users. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5110.4s)]
*  Right now you have a situation in which [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5113.839999999999s)]
*  during these campaigns, hardline affiliated organizations [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5115.719999999999s)]
*  like Tasnim News are using them in order to identify protesters. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5120.96s)]
*  And the platforms not having Persian language capabilities [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5126.92s)]
*  are not taking down those accounts. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5130.48s)]
*  Similarly, there's an opportunity [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5132.28s)]
*  to invest more in the resources in order to protect users [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5134.2s)]
*  and take down those accounts. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5138.04s)]
*  There is certainly more opportunity [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5139.8s)]
*  for making sure that the private sector is being responsive [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5142.4400000000005s)]
*  to these sorts of attacks, that there's a closer information [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5145.04s)]
*  loop, that there are digital security resources that [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5148.12s)]
*  are being made available. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5150.72s)]
*  And not just being made available to the diaspora, [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5151.76s)]
*  but the religious minorities that [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5155.72s)]
*  are inside of the country and further isolated [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5158.12s)]
*  from anything else. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5160.4800000000005s)]
*  We go into this a bit, but there's always [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5163.2s)]
*  measures that can be extended, especially when you start [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5165.92s)]
*  to prioritize dissidents, religious minorities, [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5169.2s)]
*  and understand that they are the Canary in the coal mine [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5172.96s)]
*  if you want to be utilitarian, but also just kind of morally [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5175.639999999999s)]
*  the center of these attacks. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5179.28s)]
*  So this is just a taste of all the insights and information [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5182.96s)]
*  that are in the reports. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5186.0s)]
*  I really urge you all to read it. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5187.04s)]
*  And please join me in thanking the speakers. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5188.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBSrXWPZP0&t=5190.16s)]
