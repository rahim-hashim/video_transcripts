Video Description: Following the revolution that toppled dictator Muammar Qadhafi, successive episodes of civil war and endemic violence have irrevocably altered Libya's social fabric, transforming identities and social hierarchies, elite networks, and relationships between communities. The consequences of these shifting dynamics will have far reaching implicationsâ€”for both the Libyan state and its citizens and for outside policymakers working on mediation, diplomacy, and development. 

A panel of distinguished Libyan and foreign scholars will discuss these changes and their policy implications, to mark the release of a new edited volume.

*  join us. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=114.26s)]
*  I'm Kevin Mazur, a lecturer at Northwestern University and the author of Revolution in [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=115.34s)]
*  Syria, Identity, Networks and Repression, published by Cambridge University Press. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=118.38000000000001s)]
*  In this book, you discuss the numerous acute impacts violence has had on Libyan society [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=125.26s)]
*  over the past decade, and in particular how violence shapes political identities, creates [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=129.58s)]
*  social rifts between and within communities and remade gender relations in Libya. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=134.46s)]
*  I'd like to start with you, Virjaneet, to begin by explaining a bit how you chose this [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=139.46s)]
*  topic and if you could tell us a little bit more about the intersection between violence [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=143.82000000000002s)]
*  and social transformations in Libya. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=147.98000000000002s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=149.74s)]
*  Thank you very much, Sarah. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=150.74s)]
*  And thank you very much to Carnegie for this opportunity. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=151.74s)]
*  Well, with this book, our objective has been to document and analyze the transformation [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=154.94s)]
*  that Libyan society has had in the past since 2011 amid different phases of conflict. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=160.66000000000003s)]
*  And we in particular wanted to contribute to filling some gaps in research. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=166.86s)]
*  This required, on the one hand, granular observation, and this is why we have a wonderful [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=172.66s)]
*  lineup of contributors who have direct experience of the field in Libya, but also personal experience. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=177.82s)]
*  And the different chapters we wanted in particular to really, different issues we wanted to focus [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=184.01999999999998s)]
*  on, were issues that have been key to this issue of the intersection of violence and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=189.82s)]
*  society, but have been very much under-researched and under-explored. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=195.22s)]
*  So in particular, the war in Benghazi, which has had a critical impact on the trajectory [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=199.94s)]
*  of the conflict, is the subject of two chapters in this book. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=205.14s)]
*  We have also a chapter focusing on the changing social relationships in the southern city [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=209.06s)]
*  of Sabha and the impact these transformations have had on the broader southern region. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=218.74s)]
*  Also a chapter which I co-authored with my colleague Ms. Bah Omar on former regime constituencies, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=225.46s)]
*  Wolfram's lecture on Libya's public sector, and of course, last but not least, the contributions [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=230.86s)]
*  of Emad and Rima on the youth and gender roles. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=239.54000000000002s)]
*  All these aspects of social transformation that have not really been discussed, explored, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=243.9s)]
*  And we thought it was very important because one of the central arguments of the book, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=251.54s)]
*  that contrary to what is maybe often thought, violence is not purely destructive. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=255.94s)]
*  It has a very deep impact on social relations, but it also transforms and creates new social [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=263.7s)]
*  relations. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=271.3s)]
*  And this is what we wanted to look at, how various episodes of violence have transformed [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=273.26s)]
*  social loyalties, social hierarchies, group identities, and also try to see the different [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=279.42s)]
*  types of effects that violence has had on these social relations. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=286.06s)]
*  We also, in this regard, in the introduction, try to have at least open some pathways for [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=290.1s)]
*  further theoretical contributions in the future about the different types of effects that [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=297.78s)]
*  violence have, distinguishing between systemic effects, first order effects, and second [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=303.94s)]
*  order effects. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=310.54s)]
*  And I think one of the key issues that we're also trying to look at, and that will of course [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=312.1s)]
*  require further research, is also trying to understand under which circumstances or what [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=318.46s)]
*  are the key determinants that make that some of these transformations can be consolidated [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=323.78s)]
*  and last even after conflict has ended. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=330.06s)]
*  So we look at these two different aspects, what has changed and what are the different [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=334.38s)]
*  effects of violence, but also try to start reflecting on how come that some of these [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=339.26s)]
*  transformations will last and will constitute the basis of a new social and possibly political [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=347.38s)]
*  order or not. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=354.94s)]
*  Wonderful. Thank you so much. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=360.58s)]
*  Next, I'd like to bring in Imad. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=363.26s)]
*  Imad, your chapter has quite a provocative title, which is the Degeneration of a Libyan [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=365.65999999999997s)]
*  Generation. And I was hoping you could explain for us the role of youth in Libyan society [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=370.26s)]
*  during the past decade and sort of how you came about that title. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=374.98s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, my chapter was quite challenging for me, both personally and professionally, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=379.86s)]
*  because I technically am sort of part of this generation mentioned in the title. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=387.34s)]
*  What was perhaps as well challenging for me is that I had to channel both my kind of role [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=396.21999999999997s)]
*  as a, I won't say observer, but for someone that experienced this sort of first hand, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=402.26s)]
*  but also zoom out a little bit, given that my experience doesn't really speak to the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=408.9s)]
*  entire country's obviously given the wide areas of different different conflicts there. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=414.38s)]
*  So what I tried to do, along with Wolfram and Virginie's help, whom I'd like to also thank [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=420.54s)]
*  for their for helping me frame the sort of chapter was essentially look at overarching [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=426.78s)]
*  themes within within what happened to youth since 2011 onwards. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=434.14s)]
*  To my knowledge, there isn't. And despite the fact that I did look, there isn't much [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=440.21999999999997s)]
*  that was written about this particular topic. There's a lot on social movements elsewhere, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=445.09999999999997s)]
*  in other countries, etc. But there's not a lot that tackles young people's experiences [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=450.58s)]
*  from an academic standpoint, a deep dive into their experiences in Libya since 2011 onwards. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=456.53999999999996s)]
*  From my vantage point, this chapter was quite very important because this is a segment of [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=465.14s)]
*  the population that is the largest, which means that there is a wide area of experiences that [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=472.14s)]
*  that they have. The theme that I framed the chapter through is essentially a decline in agency. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=478.74s)]
*  And that's that kind of partly explains the title. But what I also tried to do is, is to [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=486.90000000000003s)]
*  explain how they reacted to this decline of agency. So not only frame it in a way where you have [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=495.1s)]
*  the sort of this decline from 2011 over time, but also explain what they did or what they chose as [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=501.98s)]
*  alternatives. So for some, for some it was politics, for others it was civil society, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=511.02s)]
*  for some it was armed groups, essentially. And there are various reasons for why for why that is. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=516.14s)]
*  But in a lot of cases, these were these were coping strategies. One of the other challenges [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=524.3s)]
*  for me is that we're talking about 12 years now since the revolution onwards. So in my chapter, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=531.26s)]
*  there's a sort of old Libyan youth and new Libyan youth, younger people that are there today that [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=538.3s)]
*  are 20 years old, 18 years old, years old, etc. And for the most part, half of half of their life, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=545.9s)]
*  if you're talking about an 18 year old, almost half of your life has been in a situation of [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=552.38s)]
*  quasi conflict. You've experienced at least one, if not more, more conflicts that sort of socialized [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=558.7s)]
*  you in your formative years. Whereas for all this older cadre of youth, you had far more [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=565.42s)]
*  political exposure because of the two years that followed the two or three years that followed the [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=573.66s)]
*  revolution that were sort of technically stable. So from a political consciousness standpoint, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=578.38s)]
*  in the immediate aftermath of the revolution, you had far more exposure to the political space [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=586.62s)]
*  amongst that segment of young people. For the sort of younger generation, who's probably a lot more [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=591.42s)]
*  critical to the to the country's future today, the exposure is unfortunately a lot less. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=598.22s)]
*  And the violent socialization, I would say, is far more visceral in that the 2011 conflict had sort [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=605.74s)]
*  of an overarching narrative of a revolution, whether we agree with or disagree with it. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=613.8199999999999s)]
*  Whereas the conflicts that followed had narratives that were vastly different and were explicitly [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=619.18s)]
*  intra-communal conflict. So it was more within the context of a sort of acknowledged civil war, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=626.9399999999999s)]
*  so to speak. And that has an impact on the psyche of young people, etc. Yeah, I'll leave it at that [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=632.86s)]
*  and maybe we can talk more in the Q&A. Great, thank you so much. I'd next like to turn to Rima. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=640.86s)]
*  And Rima, you also addressed a very important topic in your chapter, the role of gender relations. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=648.62s)]
*  Can you speak a little bit about your findings on gender relations during a time of conflict? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=653.1s)]
*  Yes, and I think I have a slide that I can share with you. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=657.82s)]
*  So my chapter was about women changing roles in times of conflict. And one month ago, and after [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=663.6600000000001s)]
*  six months after finishing this book chapter, there was a Libyan woman standing in Tripoli [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=670.38s)]
*  in the airport and questions about traveling without a man by a local force. And this was [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=677.74s)]
*  one of my concerns in the chapter regarding women's roles and social transformations. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=684.6999999999999s)]
*  My chapter examines how the consequences of violence and conflict have transformed [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=687.98s)]
*  women's roles. And I wrote it as an observer and also as a Libyan woman who lived her life [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=694.06s)]
*  in Tripoli and affected by a situation and been around women who shared their stories and [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=700.06s)]
*  expectations. And I wrote it as a question of how women's roles have changed in the past. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=706.14s)]
*  So the main discussion is how the conflict and insecurity in Libya made the society needed to [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=712.7800000000001s)]
*  protect women through alternative security mechanisms. And in response to that, how women [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=719.5s)]
*  roles have been transformed to interplay within the social control in public and private spaces. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=726.7s)]
*  Was this positive or negative? We will find out in this session. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=733.58s)]
*  My main points in the chapter are divided into two sections, which is the public spaces and private [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=738.86s)]
*  spaces. For the public spaces, we can look at the picture that can conclude some of these aspects [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=747.66s)]
*  in the next slide. We can see a photo of a woman in the left. And we can see a picture of a woman [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=758.62s)]
*  in the left standing in queues to get their salaries in public. And they stand in hours [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=767.5799999999999s)]
*  in a humiliating way. These kind of scenes are normal in the Libyan society and not rejected [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=774.6999999999999s)]
*  by anyone. On the second photo, we can see a Libyan woman on the beach doing yoga in a public [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=779.9799999999999s)]
*  space. And this was the last picture that's been taken because after this picture was shared, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=785.5799999999999s)]
*  the woman who's responsible for this initiative was threatened not to have these kinds of [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=790.9399999999999s)]
*  activities again in Libya. So we can see that the social control in the Libyan society is supported [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=796.78s)]
*  by a growing influence of hardline religious views who prefer to limit women movement in public [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=806.38s)]
*  spaces. Although that some of the social currents prefer to see women only in kitchens, the influence [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=813.66s)]
*  of economic crisis made an opposite effect as women were breaking stereotypes when their financial [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=820.54s)]
*  participation was valued. So although traveling for women is almost forbidden, we can see a lot [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=826.78s)]
*  of women driving cars in cities. And although with all the online hate speech, we can see that social [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=833.8199999999999s)]
*  media influencers are getting more popularity and their faces are on the ads on the streets. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=840.2199999999999s)]
*  After 2011, women were increasingly required to participate because their public rules are important [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=844.86s)]
*  in the battlefield of the social and economic life, but only out of necessity, not believing in these [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=850.3000000000001s)]
*  kind of rights. So when it comes to private spheres, the conflict made women role inside the [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=856.78s)]
*  family very important. They were like the anchors of the family crisis. They were the psychological [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=866.3000000000001s)]
*  and financial support. And this situation empowered women in private spaces to balance their roles with [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=872.6999999999999s)]
*  men by participating more in the family decision making and problem solving, sometimes even to [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=880.14s)]
*  protect them from domestic violence within this new kind of roles. The social control [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=887.0999999999999s)]
*  sorry, the social control over women is still pushing them to restrict it in private spaces. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=895.8199999999999s)]
*  And some may have to actually pay for it. For example, today I can go to play an exercise on [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=901.26s)]
*  the sun, the sun, the Tripoli or play a sports game. And my only option is to pay for a highly [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=907.98s)]
*  priced gyms where it has closed windows. However, this expansion in women roles in public spaces [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=914.06s)]
*  regarding regarding private spaces didn't take up some of their domestic duties, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=924.54s)]
*  leading them to struggle with the work life balance and pressure. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=929.74s)]
*  So in conclusion, in my chapter, this crisis have two kind of effects, the effects of economic crisis [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=935.4200000000001s)]
*  and effect of insecurity. For the economic crisis, we can see that the social transformation made [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=943.1s)]
*  women either be seeking new roles and breaking social stereotypes or forced to deal with the [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=949.1s)]
*  existing or restricted rules and spaces and work around them. While insecurity affected women by [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=954.94s)]
*  creating a need for social protection in the absence of a fissure one. This enabled the [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=962.5400000000001s)]
*  an importance or what they market themselves as an importance rule of the armed groups and the [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=968.46s)]
*  hard-rightedness currents as they seem by the society now as the active protectors for the [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=974.22s)]
*  family honours and gender segregation. This situation has led women to have limited [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=979.74s)]
*  participation opportunities and choices in public and private spaces, although the attempts and [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=987.82s)]
*  needs to break social stereotypes are important and they are still fighting for it. I welcome you [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=994.14s)]
*  on the Q&A for any questions regarding my chapter. Great, thank you so much. Speaking of the Q&A, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1001.02s)]
*  I just want to let everyone know that we will have a live Q&A session following our panelists [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1009.74s)]
*  and discussant remarks where you can ask us questions. And to do that, just use the live chat [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1014.0600000000001s)]
*  feature in YouTube and feel free to start putting your questions in there now and we will get to [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1019.02s)]
*  them again after we finish with panelists and discussant remarks. So let me next bring in Fred. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1023.26s)]
*  And Fred, can you please talk to us about the expound on the role of the security sector and [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1028.6200000000001s)]
*  social rupturing in Benghazi? Yeah, great. And it's great to be here with you all and [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1033.58s)]
*  congrats to all of the authors on this fabulous book. So my chapter really offers a narrative [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1044.1399999999999s)]
*  history of the war for Benghazi from 2014 to 2018 under the auspices of what's called [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1051.4199999999998s)]
*  Operation Dignity. And it really focuses on how violence transformed the landscape of social [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1060.54s)]
*  relations in this very complex city and how security institutions were also transformed [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1066.86s)]
*  by that violence. And it really starts with a question. When I visited Benghazi in late 2013 [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1074.86s)]
*  and again in 2015 and 2017 at the height of the conflict, what I saw on the ground just really [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1081.18s)]
*  didn't correspond to what was being said in the media and a lot of common analyses. And this [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1088.54s)]
*  really, my observations really stem from interviews with the combatants, certainly on the Heftar side [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1094.78s)]
*  and also displaced fighters who were fighting Heftar, but also families who were displaced [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1102.78s)]
*  often deliberately by this fighting. And the analysis rejects two commonplace tropes or [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1109.18s)]
*  assumptions. The first is that this war was a war of counterterrorism and a war against militias. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1117.5s)]
*  Certainly that element existed, but it's much more complex than that. And the second [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1123.66s)]
*  trope or assumption is that it was a war between communal groups or tribes and especially this idea [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1129.42s)]
*  of tribes that were native to Eastern Libya and Benghazi versus families that were so-called [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1137.26s)]
*  foreign families or from Western Libya or rural tribes versus urban tribes. Certainly those [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1143.42s)]
*  dimensions existed and they were instrumentalized by conflict actors during the war, but they were [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1150.22s)]
*  not the primary drivers. And so again, what struck me is that this war for Benghazi was, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1155.8200000000002s)]
*  on the one hand, it was a very national war. There were these big questions at stake, right? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1163.66s)]
*  The role of Islam in political life, the question of who controls the security sector, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1168.22s)]
*  federalism. But it was also a deeply personal and intimate war. This was a war waged between [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1174.5400000000002s)]
*  neighborhoods, within neighborhoods, between people who had previous affiliations and connections. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1181.18s)]
*  They went to school together, they worked together. There were multiple factors at play. And my [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1187.3400000000001s)]
*  chapter really tries to capture this social complexity. And it really focuses on the role [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1192.94s)]
*  of social violence as a corollary and an outcome of this campaign. And so on the one hand, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1199.8200000000002s)]
*  Operation Dignity was certainly successful. Heftar won this war, his opponents were driven out. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1207.18s)]
*  But the social costs of that victory were enormous, both in terms of the social fabric, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1212.78s)]
*  the reordering of the composition of certain neighborhoods, the displacement, the perpetuation [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1219.02s)]
*  of grievances by those that were displaced, narratives of revenge and return. But also, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1224.94s)]
*  I think the forces that it unleashed within the city. And many of these forces have to do with [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1230.7s)]
*  the irregular armed groups that Heftar used as part of his campaign. And I really focus on those [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1235.98s)]
*  irregular armed groups as the primary perpetrators of this social violence to include attacks on [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1243.18s)]
*  homes, businesses, rivals. And these irregular groups went by various names, support forces, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1251.42s)]
*  youth of the neighborhood. In many cases, they were sort of self-protection forces that were [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1260.7s)]
*  attached to particular neighborhoods. In some cases, they had a tribal component, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1265.66s)]
*  a religious component. The point being, and I get into great detail on this, and I hope my chapter [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1270.22s)]
*  sheds light on for comparative scholars of urban conflict. And many of these themes will sound [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1277.58s)]
*  familiar to those studying violence in urban areas. These groups, in many cases, they did not [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1283.9s)]
*  necessarily sign up to Heftar's agenda per se. They had their own agendas at work. And many of [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1290.78s)]
*  these were related to longstanding vendettas, personal rivalries, economic rivalries. And so, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1296.62s)]
*  you find a lot of the attacks that went on under the cover of counterterrorism were, in fact, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1304.3s)]
*  socioeconomically motivated. Again, the carrying out of personal familial vendettas. And so, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1310.3s)]
*  the point is that when Heftar relied upon these armed groups, really starting in October 2014, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1316.78s)]
*  he unleashed a whole set of consequences that we are still living with today. And I get into those [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1324.6200000000001s)]
*  consequences, both in terms of the culture of impunity that pervades Benghazi, where you're [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1330.78s)]
*  still seeing attacks going on against activists, disappearances, many of them carried out by these [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1336.7s)]
*  irregular militias, these paramilitary groups that were part of Heftar's effort. And also, for how [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1343.66s)]
*  the security sector was transformed. And I get into great detail on that. There is this narrative [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1350.22s)]
*  that the East is controlled by a formal military institution, the Libyan Arab Armed Forces, but [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1356.14s)]
*  it's much more complex than that. And many of these irregular paramilitaries were folded into the [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1362.38s)]
*  umbrella of Heftar's security orbit, but they still retained autonomy. And so, again, that's [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1368.8600000000001s)]
*  really what I close upon is really a plea for greater nuance in capturing the dimensions of [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1376.54s)]
*  this war, this highly consequential war from 2014 to 2018. And also, understanding that the social [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1384.3799999999999s)]
*  consequences are still present and could be a source for instability and certainly egregious [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1391.5s)]
*  human rights violations down the road. Thank you so much. It's really interesting. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1398.06s)]
*  I want to turn back to Virginie to close out the panel portion of the discussion. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1404.94s)]
*  And if you could discuss a little bit more about the former regime constituencies in the post-2011 [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1409.34s)]
*  era, that'd be great. Thank you. Yes, thank you. When we started drafting the chapter, researching [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1414.3s)]
*  the chapter with my colleague Ms. Fah, there was an interesting phenomenon happening. Dbeiba had [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1420.22s)]
*  been appointed the head of the government of national unity at the beginning of 2021. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1429.74s)]
*  So he was dominating the power center in West Libya at least. Heftar was dominating the scene [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1434.86s)]
*  in the East. So it gives the impression that you had some extent former regime people or people who [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1441.82s)]
*  had had a history and the Qadhafi who had succeeded in making a comeback. And this, by the way, also [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1447.42s)]
*  equate some of the transformations happening at the original level. If you looked what was happening [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1453.9s)]
*  in Tunis, what had happened in Egypt. So this was a very interesting thing. And we started reflecting [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1459.5s)]
*  on how can we explain this kind of comeback or at least apparent comeback of former regime figures [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1466.46s)]
*  at central powers, central positions of power. There was, I mean, there could have been a kind [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1474.3s)]
*  of easy explanation that the various phases of conflicts in 2011, 2014, 2019 had brought violence [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1480.78s)]
*  and stability and security and therefore had contributed to feeding this illusion among Libyans [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1489.42s)]
*  who may not seem the former regime people more positively. But in reality, when we really worked [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1495.1000000000001s)]
*  more in depth on this chapter, we soon realized that it's very clear that not all former regime [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1503.1000000000001s)]
*  people had been rehabilitated, if we can say, and managed to regain influence. So the question was [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1510.8600000000001s)]
*  what had been the key determinants of this comeback and also what can you say about the future? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1517.3400000000001s)]
*  And I think our chapter, interestingly, is a kind of, is located at the crossroad between [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1523.42s)]
*  the evolution or the transformation of social relations between communities, also the [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1530.38s)]
*  transformation of power structures in Libya after 2011. The first thing that we thought was very [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1536.94s)]
*  important to look at is what do we mean exactly when we talk about former regime? What does this [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1544.3000000000002s)]
*  category mean? And in reality, it's clear that during the war of 2011, there were armed confrontations [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1551.3400000000001s)]
*  between supporters and opponents of the regime. The result of this was that at the end of the war, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1559.1s)]
*  Libya was divided between victors on the one hand and defeated on the other hand. But in reality, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1564.6999999999998s)]
*  when you looked into this more in details, you realize that not all the individuals and communities [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1570.62s)]
*  that were identified as pro-Qadhafi were necessarily people who had played a central role in the Qadhafi [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1576.6999999999998s)]
*  regime. Clearly, there had been divisions within regime circles and defections during the war. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1583.18s)]
*  You had also communities like Bani Walid, who had been considered a kind of stronghold of opposition [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1591.26s)]
*  to Qadhafi before 2011, who supported the regime. So at the end of the war, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1599.42s)]
*  very interestingly, you realize that this category of former regime was not really something that [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1606.8600000000001s)]
*  existed before, but was created more as a result of the conflict itself. So you had those who had [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1613.5s)]
*  supported Qadhafi militarily that were identified as former regime constituencies, and this was like [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1621.18s)]
*  political stance. You also had entire communities who were dragged into this former regime camp, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1627.18s)]
*  not on the basis of a political stance or a personal choice, but rather on the basis of [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1634.5400000000002s)]
*  collective identity. And this is something which is very striking and I think that [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1639.5800000000002s)]
*  pervades the whole book, which is the impact of this division of society in a very binary way [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1644.78s)]
*  between the suwar, the revolutionary and the Islam, the former regime people after 2011. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1653.8200000000002s)]
*  It really took root in the New Libya and it really trapped people in collective identities [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1659.66s)]
*  that were difficult to escape over the course of the years. So the chapter looking at this [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1665.42s)]
*  formation of the former regime category is also, I believe, interesting to look at because it also [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1675.1000000000001s)]
*  shows something that we want to insist on in the book and in the introduction, is that it's very [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1681.5s)]
*  important to look at the cumulative impact of the different phases of conflict. It's not only [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1688.46s)]
*  violence, one shot of violence, it's the result and the impact of a number of waves and successive [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1694.78s)]
*  phases, violence sometimes being more intense, sometimes receding, and these phases also in the [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1702.22s)]
*  way they like order themselves or constitute a sequence also have an impact on this social [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1710.06s)]
*  transformation we're looking at. What is interesting in Libya in the former regime case is precisely [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1717.9s)]
*  to look how this category has evolved based on the different phases of the conflict. Now basically [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1726.6200000000001s)]
*  a first phase, which is what the phase I would call that the phase of defeat, punishment and revenge, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1733.98s)]
*  which is basically 2011 to 2014, and you really have like the leaders and the community which are [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1739.74s)]
*  identified as supporters of Qaddafi, which are subjected to collective punishment, exclusion [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1746.94s)]
*  at the social level but also at the political level. So there are the victors of the war trying [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1753.5800000000002s)]
*  to take revenge for what happened before 2011, but also those defeated groups starting to dream of [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1759.5800000000002s)]
*  taking revenge, and this is something which is very important but it's going to frame also some of the [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1767.02s)]
*  later developments. Key turning point which is also something which is common to most communities [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1773.42s)]
*  in Libya is 2014, and the period 2014-2018 in Libya for the former regime really shows a shift [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1779.9s)]
*  where you have many among the former regime constituencies looking for, as they call it [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1788.94s)]
*  themselves, looking to train back to Tripoli. They want to try and regain influence, they don't [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1796.78s)]
*  really know how to do it, they're divided, they don't have a unified strategy, neither strong [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1802.6200000000001s)]
*  leadership, but they try to benefit and to take advantage of the institutional divisions and the [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1807.74s)]
*  fact that both camps, the western camp to make it very binary and the eastern camp, all trying to [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1814.3s)]
*  compete, to attract within their ranks former regime affiliates from the security sector, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1824.38s)]
*  social leaders with local influence and also political figures. And this is very important and [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1830.94s)]
*  allows former regime people to in some cases get back into the picture and start to play a political [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1837.0200000000002s)]
*  role again. And then this is really accelerated, this trend accelerates after 2018, as a result [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1846.46s)]
*  also of the mediation process led by the UN, but still you see that the key characteristics of this [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1856.54s)]
*  former regime category is that they are very divided, they lack a strong leadership and what [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1866.22s)]
*  really moves them in reality is more pragmatism and personal interest than the sense of a common [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1872.06s)]
*  belonging. You don't have any figure trying to bring them together and say well I'm a representative [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1879.34s)]
*  of the former regime. They are really in reality more focused, those former regime affiliates who [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1885.34s)]
*  are re-emerging after 2018 are more focusing on establishing alliances with revolutionary forces [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1894.6200000000001s)]
*  and armed groups than representing the community of those who were defeated. So I would say these [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1902.8600000000001s)]
*  are the key points, the fact that those who make a comeback in the end are not so much people who [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1910.38s)]
*  present themselves as willing to defend the interests of the former regime constituencies. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1920.3000000000002s)]
*  Those who manage to make a comeback are also not everybody, they are essentially those who were [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1926.7s)]
*  close to Gaddafi but belonged to revolutionary cities or communities, so the divide between [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1933.8200000000002s)]
*  revolutionary and a former regime remains. I mean if you have been defeated in the war it's going [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1939.5800000000002s)]
*  to be very difficult to make a comeback and this is particularly true for some cities like [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1944.9399999999998s)]
*  Sirte or Seba for instance and I think this maybe to summarize raises also interesting questions for [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1950.9399999999998s)]
*  the future of Libya, again connecting the social dimension and the political structures they [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1959.1799999999998s)]
*  mentioned. Abdelhamid Beyba, the current prime minister in Tripoli, was actually not politically [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1965.5s)]
*  promoted because of his links to Gaddafi, on the contrary he's managed to re-emerge because he built [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1971.58s)]
*  alliances and cut deals with revolutionary forces which I think is a key element which [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1978.78s)]
*  is common to many former regime figures who managed to make a comeback. Second point, questions about [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1984.9399999999998s)]
*  key figures like Saif al-Islam and there's a big question here, I mean what would be the strategy [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1991.6599999999999s)]
*  of someone like Saif al-Islam? Would he like do like the others, try to build on his social base [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=1997.1s)]
*  to bargain and find a kind of an agreement with revolutionary forces or on the contrary [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2003.8999999999999s)]
*  would he do like what any, I mean nobody else did, which is trying to position himself [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2011.82s)]
*  as the figure that can reunify the Gaddafi area networks and take up the leadership of the new [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2018.6999999999998s)]
*  force. So far this is not something that we see at all but I think it raises interesting questions [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2024.22s)]
*  with regard to how social links are being used and manipulated in the political sphere in Libya [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2030.62s)]
*  and this will obviously open new questions for the future. Thank you very much. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2041.4199999999998s)]
*  Great, thank you so much. So now I'd like to bring in Kevin to provide some commentary on the volume [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2048.38s)]
*  and just a reminder to everyone that after Kevin's remarks we will turn to live Q&A so please put [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2054.06s)]
*  your questions in the live chat feature in YouTube. Thanks, over to you Kevin. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2059.1s)]
*  Yeah thanks Sarah and thanks Virginie for inviting me. This is really, it's been a pleasure to read [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2063.98s)]
*  and have to comment on this book because wow there's just a lot here. I mean I really [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2069.42s)]
*  congratulate you guys and it's not just its rich information on Libya which it has. I mean I've [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2073.02s)]
*  never seen a single volume like this on my own country of expertise, Syria, and it makes me [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2077.34s)]
*  jealous but also you have some links and some threads that pull through that tell us something [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2082.94s)]
*  about what Libya's potential future trajectory is and for other countries that it reaches. So [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2087.98s)]
*  that's what I want to kind of try to pull out here, a couple of big themes and then how it allows us [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2092.86s)]
*  to look at sort of policy prescriptions potentially and how we can do that. So I think [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2097.82s)]
*  the first big theme is about how violence is reshaping society itself and that has after effects [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2103.9s)]
*  on politics and I think one of the things that's important here is the ways that the spaces that [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2111.34s)]
*  are available to actors that wouldn't have had those spaces before are opening or closing. So [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2115.34s)]
*  in Imad's chapter for example he talks about how the revolution creates a new space for youth to be [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2120.62s)]
*  politically active, imagine a new governance structure and then violence closes that down, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2125.82s)]
*  forces them to engage in the military field or for some of them smuggling other forms of criminality. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2130.2999999999997s)]
*  You could almost throw out the name Libya and put Syria in for the trajectory of youth that are [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2136.06s)]
*  involved in the rebellion here. Violence forces people to be back to their localities, to work [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2140.3799999999997s)]
*  with local militias and then after war people aren't thinking about political change anymore, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2147.1s)]
*  they're trying to survive or to protect themselves and this really links up with what we see [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2151.5s)]
*  knowledge about post-war settlement in sub-Saharan African countries and even in [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2156.94s)]
*  Lebanon today there's not for example been a civil war but people are not thinking as much [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2161.7400000000002s)]
*  about political change because they're trying to survive. So that theme I think is also borne out [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2167.1s)]
*  in in Rima's work about how there's a space that was open first of all for militias that can come [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2173.18s)]
*  and regulate women differently as she talked about at the beginning of her presentation but also that [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2177.82s)]
*  closes down spaces that women would have had and what I think is really important about that paper [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2183.34s)]
*  is that it she shows that it's not purely a loss. There are things that are gained through [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2187.7400000000002s)]
*  necessity so this example of of queuing or women driving and she talks about how you know sometimes [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2191.9s)]
*  they'll work in they can't go in public transit as much anymore but work and write it use a taxi on [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2197.1000000000004s)]
*  the on the side as part of their strategies of income of creating income and and frankly talking [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2201.9s)]
*  about the ways that it's cross-cut by class so having to use a private gym rather than a public [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2207.1000000000004s)]
*  space and only certain people have access to this really shows us these fine level dynamics [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2211.02s)]
*  that will help us to understand how how the society is changing and what I think the big [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2215.82s)]
*  theme that comes out of all of this is that there are new structures that are emerging not at the [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2220.38s)]
*  level this sort of macro level of you're with the regime or not with the regime before or you're in [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2224.7s)]
*  a certain tribe or in another tribe and that sorts everything nor at the level of the individual that [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2229.82s)]
*  this nuclear family or this person is doing this but intermediate or meso level structures the ways [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2234.3s)]
*  that people are using extended family tie like Virginia talked about in terms of saying that [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2239.1s)]
*  the Viva is from a certain family a certain place to get to have some political advancement to form [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2243.9s)]
*  a militia say in the earlier period or a town or regional identity these are things that emerge and [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2249.66s)]
*  the people use a strategy of survival that have knock-on consequences and that brings me to the [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2254.62s)]
*  second major point I think which is about identity divides these are very important to all of the [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2260.14s)]
*  presentations that all of the chapters in the book but they're complicated you can't just put [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2265.5s)]
*  it down to with the regime before not with the regime with the revolution not with the revolution [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2269.66s)]
*  this tribe that tribe there's these there are these composites that often keep coming back to some of [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2274.14s)]
*  these sort of intermediate level identities and I think Virginia and Miss Bosh's paper talks about [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2279.1s)]
*  this most explicitly because they talk about I think and Virginia explicated this in detail that [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2284.46s)]
*  you know you have this combination of having to have revolutionary credentials you somehow have [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2291.1s)]
*  to be attached to the revolution but that's not enough you have to have some kind of technical [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2294.86s)]
*  competence be from a certain type of family this the Viva example I think is is helpful on this [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2298.7000000000003s)]
*  and I think that we see something that's kind of similar to this in Syria where you know you need [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2304.46s)]
*  the cover of a family reputation whether it is to pass through a rebel checkpoint or to go back for [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2309.42s)]
*  example once the Syrian regime is still in power you know to get to be able to return to an area [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2315.6600000000003s)]
*  that people have been displaced from it's not just who you are as a person it depends on some [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2322.46s)]
*  of these identities that maybe wouldn't have been as relevant before they emerge and new ones are [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2326.14s)]
*  created too which actually I think is very helpful Fred's paper to talk about how what he says is a [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2332.54s)]
*  two-level game this idea that there's national actors trying to get national prominence but you [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2337.7400000000002s)]
*  also have these very local politics of irregular armed groups and so any of these individual [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2342.54s)]
*  narratives about counterterrorism migrant versus native secular versus islamist none of them are [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2348.46s)]
*  wrong per se but they're being instrumentalized by people that have national ambitions say or also [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2353.5s)]
*  local at local ambitions to sort of get back at arrival to get more power on a local level [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2359.5s)]
*  and I have to say this is really I enjoyed reading this so much because it's sort of [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2364.62s)]
*  showing the classic literature about the ways that this happens in civil wars or even in in riots [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2369.42s)]
*  say in in South Asia the ways that people use this violence not only to create and solidify [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2374.86s)]
*  identities but also just more simply to rally people around their side so they can accomplish [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2379.5s)]
*  their own purposes which often have nothing to do with their ideology and here there's a wonderful [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2383.34s)]
*  new book by Rafael Lefebvre about the Tahrir movement in the city of Tripoli in Lebanon during [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2388.38s)]
*  the Lebanese civil war where he shows that a lot of this very islamist group actually recruited and [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2393.5s)]
*  was able to sustain itself because of solidarities that were about a neighborhood of people pursuing [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2398.7000000000003s)]
*  local goals so what I think that this tells us sort of more generally is that when you get a war [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2402.94s)]
*  that unsettles these old orders creates spaces for new actors there are new identities that are [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2407.82s)]
*  created and hardened but often there are also people pulling back on these older identities [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2412.86s)]
*  on these identities that are based on a town on a neighborhood on an extended family that aren't [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2417.02s)]
*  high level identities but they're there for people to use because they have to have new strategies [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2422.3s)]
*  of securing subsistence and security so I want to now kind of take these into looking at more broadly [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2427.02s)]
*  how Libya is the same as or differs from other countries and I think there are parallels and [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2434.6200000000003s)]
*  these themes come out in these different places that I've talked about but they differ based on [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2439.1800000000003s)]
*  who's won the war and the state of the nature of state resources and institutions so in Libya you [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2442.78s)]
*  have an old regime that's displaced but the money that was there before and some of the state [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2449.02s)]
*  institutions remain so you can create new alliances and as Virginia and Miss Bacha's paper has shown [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2452.7s)]
*  gradually increase create gradually include the old regime not as the old regime but as parts of [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2458.3799999999997s)]
*  it and as Fred's shown that this is often through new alliances and through identities the sort of [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2463.74s)]
*  our example opposite of this I think is Syria in the current Arab world where you haven't displaced [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2469.8999999999996s)]
*  the old regime but you also don't have any more money so you have massive social change because [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2475.8199999999997s)]
*  you have new warlords instead of the old business classes but you have massive popular suffering [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2480.46s)]
*  that's going on because not only people are you know they can't create productive economic activity [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2485.98s)]
*  but you have this regime controlling who can come in who's displaced from the country [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2490.94s)]
*  and stealing from them and taking and stopping what they can do and actually a really interesting [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2495.02s)]
*  parallel that Rima's proposal brought up or her presentation brought up is actually the regime was [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2499.26s)]
*  trumpeting the yoga that was going on on the beach in in Tartus because they were saying look how [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2505.5s)]
*  secular we are and look how modern and wonderful everything is and I said Syria which is very [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2511.5s)]
*  different from these local actors once that regime was displaced in Libya shutting down this type of [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2516.62s)]
*  display of women being out in public space what I think is closest probably to the Libyan case is [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2522.06s)]
*  Iraq you have a replacement of the old regime albeit at a 20 year distance now and this type [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2528.78s)]
*  of funding and some of the state institutions remaining and so you can have new networks [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2534.86s)]
*  arising and consolidating but the view on the ground actually looks similar to a lot of the [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2539.42s)]
*  insecurity that's described in the in Libya in this volume so in a place like Basra for example [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2543.1s)]
*  you have state institutions and state security services and militias that are allied but you [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2548.1400000000003s)]
*  also have local violence among people based on extended family ties and people trying to bring [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2553.02s)]
*  in many different intermediaries in a situation that's very unstable for people on the ground [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2557.9s)]
*  so I think ultimately what this gets us to then is that these situations of war create [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2561.98s)]
*  new ways that people have to secure their subsistence and secure their security and get [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2566.78s)]
*  their get security and they do this with these intermediate level pies that reshape who it is [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2571.5s)]
*  that holds power and and I think that really tells us that we have to look at security in a different [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2576.22s)]
*  way so the first big policy implication of this is that this intermediate level created by social [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2580.94s)]
*  change and violence says that we have to think about what it is that we're doing when we intervene [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2586.54s)]
*  reconstruct something like this where is that money going right that's a standard question but [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2591.34s)]
*  when we look at these new structures that are being created and the games that people are playing [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2596.38s)]
*  between the national and the local it gives us a different approach and it might even give us a [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2600.38s)]
*  different approach to thinking about questions for example of women's place in public spaces [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2604.54s)]
*  because we have to ask this question maybe at a more local level is who are the actors that can [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2610.1400000000003s)]
*  make a difference how do we police people that are going off script of what the national rules are [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2613.98s)]
*  to say that you need to have someone accompanying you as a woman when you travel at the airport [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2619.5s)]
*  and that's maybe defeatist in the sense that you can't have a full national solution but it's also [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2624.3s)]
*  realistic to think about the ways in which people are regulating this on the ground and actually [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2630.06s)]
*  going a little bit in the different direction what I liked so much about the volume was that it gives [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2634.86s)]
*  us a view of a counterpoint to some of the elite focus in the ways that we think about post-war [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2639.26s)]
*  transformation so the trend is definitely in the field now towards stabilization right it's western [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2644.62s)]
*  experts and countries but also the arab league is welcomed back in Bashar al-Assad and the syrian [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2649.66s)]
*  regime you see elite support support for elite deals in libya and on the one hand you can't do [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2654.62s)]
*  much without the security picture being sorted but on the end but on the other there's a patronage [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2660.46s)]
*  structure where oil money is being handed out to basically allow people to survive and as from [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2664.94s)]
*  lacher's piece in the the book says increasingly take more of that than even was done under an [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2669.98s)]
*  old regime so you're not even consolidating something like an old political order and so [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2675.66s)]
*  thinking our way out of this is not a simple thing but it requires us to understand the ways that the [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2680.06s)]
*  society has been transformed and what that means for what the political settlement is because the [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2684.78s)]
*  people that are under those elites are different from what we might think they were or what they [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2689.02s)]
*  are or what they were before a revolution and years of war changed the society so the idea that [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2692.7s)]
*  i think the big contribution in in general intervention of this volume is to say that [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2699.18s)]
*  elites constituencies and the moral order under them to quote from the introduction [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2703.74s)]
*  are really changed if we want to know how to make a deal at those higher levels we have to pay [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2708.7799999999997s)]
*  attention to this stuff and so we're lucky to have this volume to turn our attention to thanks great [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2712.7799999999997s)]
*  thank you so much that was very helpful so i'd now like to turn to q a and just remind everyone [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2718.62s)]
*  if you'd like to ask a question please use the live chat feature in youtube the first question [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2724.38s)]
*  that has come in um that i will just open up to whoever would like to respond first is what [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2729.98s)]
*  strategies could be implemented to mitigate violence in libya and how might these interventions [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2735.1800000000003s)]
*  influence social transformation and the country's future trajectory so whoever wants to take that [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2740.3s)]
*  one that's a big question [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2746.94s)]
*  go ahead fred [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2759.7400000000002s)]
*  well that really is the million dollar question and a lot of us have spent over a decade trying [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2763.5s)]
*  to trying to tackle it and um i'll just offer some some broad you know thoughts um based on [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2768.78s)]
*  my own experience and the wisdom of my my co-authors you know i think as is kevin alluded to [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2775.9s)]
*  international you know well-meaning international interventions in libya to to deal with the militia [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2782.2200000000003s)]
*  program problem to deal with violence have often been counterproductive and they've [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2789.1s)]
*  often encouraged or perpetuated the violence and so i think um what we're seeing now especially in [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2794.94s)]
*  washington is a real scaling down of of ambitions um and i think much of this is in the appropriate [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2801.26s)]
*  you know direction so we're not trying to reshape the security sector we're not trying to [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2808.3s)]
*  implement sweeping reforms to disarm or demobilize the militias but what you hear now is about shaping [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2814.86s)]
*  the social context within which armed groups operate and and again there's no expectation [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2822.86s)]
*  of overnight success you know as as imad's chapter alluded to young libyans are drawn to these armed [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2829.42s)]
*  groups for a variety of reasons and sort of criminalizing these armed groups or painting [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2836.38s)]
*  them as illegitimate really doesn't correspond with often how they're perceived which is a source [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2842.54s)]
*  of income um you know a defense for the community and so we're tackling an enormous problem here but [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2847.7400000000002s)]
*  what i hear from policymakers is again empowering um civil society groups shaping the social [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2855.34s)]
*  environments um encouraging demilitarization of certain spaces in libya like schools making [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2862.1400000000003s)]
*  certain things off limit you know mobilizing various voices but it's it's an enormous challenge [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2869.82s)]
*  because um as we've seen the violence is often you know deeply rooted and as this volume talks [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2875.42s)]
*  about in some cases is perceived as constructive and advancing certain you know interests um in [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2882.06s)]
*  this country but again we can we can devote a whole other volume to this i would just um [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2888.7s)]
*  again argue or plea for international stakeholders to first do no harm right i mean we've also seen [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2893.74s)]
*  and i don't think the volume got into this as much but international interventions have created a [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2900.7s)]
*  marketplace for violence in in libya that is empowered and perpetuated so think about all the [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2907.34s)]
*  the migration um you know initiatives and counterterrorism initiatives various [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2912.7000000000003s)]
*  libyan local actors have stepped up and offered themselves as partners on those very self-serving [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2917.5s)]
*  initiatives from europe from the united states are in migration and counterterrorism and that has [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2924.1400000000003s)]
*  perpetuated um violence in in libya as well thank you does anyone else want to come in on that as [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2928.6200000000003s)]
*  well okay um well another question um targeted towards you and that is if you could say more [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2937.1s)]
*  about violent socialization of the new young generation in terms of what it means for how [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2948.06s)]
*  youth think or see their prospects and for the types of politics they'll engage in as leaders [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2953.74s)]
*  in their 40s or 50s i mean it it vastly depends on uh which segment of youth we're talking about [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2958.3s)]
*  no i don't think there's a there's a clear there's a clear label that we can put on them or there's a [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2967.34s)]
*  clear prospect that cuts that's cross-cutting across the different segments of youth in the [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2976.2200000000003s)]
*  country but one one thing i'll one thing i'll say is that there's definitely a the trend is towards [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2982.62s)]
*  decline in agency and therefore the coping strategies are generally tend to be more towards [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2989.18s)]
*  embracing sort of the system whether it be embracing the politics in the way that it is [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=2997.26s)]
*  currently approached which is quite transactional quite quite venal quite uh not really [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3002.54s)]
*  no not not really no really regards for any popular let's say legitimacy and uh or more [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3011.1s)]
*  apolitical forms if i if i'll call them or non-non-political forms which is more in the [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3021.2599999999998s)]
*  in the security sector another thing is that a lot of people are looking now or a lot of young [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3026.94s)]
*  people are looking to the security sector as a way to enter politics in some way shape or form [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3033.18s)]
*  so you're you're looking now as security stakeholders that are having political discussions [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3040.62s)]
*  and that people in power politicians in power including prime ministers including uh ministers [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3046.94s)]
*  etc are actively mediating with and i think this is a to link it to the to the former question on on [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3053.2599999999998s)]
*  foreign interventionism etc and i would i would i don't want to put the un in the in the basket [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3061.7400000000002s)]
*  of foreign interventionism but the way mediation is tailored in libya has definitely been conducive [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3067.34s)]
*  at the moment at least to the rise of security stakeholders as political players and because a [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3073.9s)]
*  lot of these security players are young people or predominantly young people they have risen [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3079.9s)]
*  significantly as political stakeholders i was recently asked the question yesterday about [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3086.54s)]
*  the joint military commission and this older cadre of of uh of military of military from the sort of [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3092.86s)]
*  gadaffi era and and most of these guys know each other when they get into a room they generally are [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3100.06s)]
*  quite collegial is is what the word that was used but they don't have significant power on the ground [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3106.22s)]
*  and now what you're seeing is that that same sort of transactionalism is being displaced [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3112.22s)]
*  uh towards the more 30 year olds 40 years olds etc uh from from the military apparatus i was [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3120.7s)]
*  surprised to learn the the the age of of saddam for example after the the the son of khalifa [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3128.4599999999996s)]
*  who's almost my age basically in his early 30s uh and the what what that would that the rise the [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3137.26s)]
*  political prominence of such a figure which has mirrored a lot also in western libya that has very [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3145.02s)]
*  massive implications for libya in the next 30 40 years so we had issues with figures that were [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3151.82s)]
*  80 year old 80 years old uh in libya imagine having someone in his early 30s or 40s [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3158.6200000000003s)]
*  uh at with that level of political clout at this stage that makes it quite significant for the [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3165.8199999999997s)]
*  country's political trajectories moving forward now and young people are very aware of this [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3173.18s)]
*  they know this they talk about it and social might not be what they discuss very openly because they [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3179.02s)]
*  were they're worried about crackdowns etc but they are very aware of this and everyone is adapting [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3186.14s)]
*  accordingly and unfortunately at the moment most of the trends are conducive towards a return to [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3192.14s)]
*  authoritarianism in some way shape or form that's that's where libya is is heading right now or [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3198.14s)]
*  that's the that's where the consolidation of the past couple of years is leading towards so everyone [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3203.18s)]
*  is is adapting accordingly and you're seeing a lot of the strategies that were employed in the [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3209.2599999999998s)]
*  gadaffi era which weren't really tackled in in our volume but are tackled in other literature some [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3213.3399999999997s)]
*  of the strategies that were there in terms of coping mechanisms in terms of how people [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3219.66s)]
*  communicate in terms of how they navigate the crowd down on repressions etc are being employed [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3224.3799999999997s)]
*  by by by today's youth so yeah great thank you um a question for you rima do you think that [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3230.06s)]
*  limitations on women moving in the public space come from the family unit or from imposed societal [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3239.5s)]
*  regulations and if from society who is enforcing these regulations [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3245.26s)]
*  um as discussed in the book chapter the social norms and stereotypes are [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3252.5400000000004s)]
*  the main source of women movement in public space but i don't think that [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3259.9s)]
*  we can generalize that libyan families are supporting uh these limitations because it [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3266.5400000000004s)]
*  depends on the in the city and the place and on the uh classes as well but what enforces these [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3273.74s)]
*  kind of regulations is that um hardline religious religious groups and armed groups are um uh [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3281.2599999999998s)]
*  gaining popularity from uh setting themselves up as the one who are responsible of protecting [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3291.2599999999998s)]
*  women and family owners and uh and um women um issues in libya supported by these social [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3297.98s)]
*  stereotypes and social norms um so uh and and this kind of popularity uh gains them more power [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3308.22s)]
*  and more finance financing because they are seen within the libyan society as important actors and [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3316.7s)]
*  that they need to be sustained um so this is uh about the public space and this is one of the [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3325.02s)]
*  main findings in my book chapter thank you and a question for you virginie what key insights from [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3332.7s)]
*  the edited volume do you believe are most crucial in shaping future policy and mediation efforts [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3340.46s)]
*  oh i think you're muted [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3345.5s)]
*  i'm sorry for some reason we're still not hearing you [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3363.02s)]
*  i'm not sure what's happening does someone else want to respond while we try to figure out the [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3365.98s)]
*  sound issue there's any other thoughts on um insights that are the most crucial in shaping [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3371.82s)]
*  future policy and mediation efforts [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3377.58s)]
*  uh i'll i'll weigh into it just looking having looked at the edited edited volume sort of [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3383.66s)]
*  contents different chapters etc i think one of the important aspects that we need to reconcile [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3390.2200000000003s)]
*  with as a society and when i say we i mean i mean libyans is partly the history like basically uh we [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3396.62s)]
*  might not agree on a on a shared sort of uh timeline of not timeline of events but sequencing of events [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3403.66s)]
*  and possibly even narratives around the different events and the different events that we're going [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3410.78s)]
*  to be discussing in the next few weeks but i think i i think one of the key aspects of this is [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3415.98s)]
*  how to get to sort of a reconciliation as a as a society that's that's one thing [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3423.7400000000002s)]
*  the second possibly is i think the under under the fact that some of the aspects within this are [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3431.5s)]
*  under research is because a lot of the stakeholders if we're talking about iman and [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3441.74s)]
*  ice chapters for example that we're talking about here are not significantly engaged with [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3447.18s)]
*  in any meaningful form uh you have a lot of libyan literature on security sector etc on armed groups [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3451.58s)]
*  and a lot on the on the politics of it the oil etc those are the trendy topics but unfortunately [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3460.3799999999997s)]
*  in the process you lose out on a massive segment or segments of the population which are most [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3466.62s)]
*  critical to its future how to go about engaging these is i think a mediator's job but but yeah [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3473.3399999999997s)]
*  the the under research aspect to it speaks to the lack of lack of efforts in doing outreach that [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3480.94s)]
*  these to these stakeholders marginalization so if there's one sort of policy recommendation is to [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3486.7799999999997s)]
*  try and center those center those stakeholders a little bit more since we're currently in sort [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3493.66s)]
*  of a democratic process process or a democratic transition process [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3500.2999999999997s)]
*  fred did you want to come in on this as well yes i just want to give virginia one more chance [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3507.02s)]
*  can virginia can you are we able to hear you now or i guess okay so um yes so i think this volume [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3513.8199999999997s)]
*  yields a lot of wisdom for mediation and policymakers again i think um one overarching [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3522.62s)]
*  theme is the is the primacy of the local and um local context and that's often a very difficult [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3529.18s)]
*  message for policymakers who are um only have you know limited bandwidth but again this preference [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3536.7s)]
*  as was mentioned for dealing at the national level and elite deals when this entire volume really [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3544.14s)]
*  speaks to the agency of of local actors and so really this volume is a call for greater attention [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3550.3s)]
*  to nuance in terms of the the categories with which mediators and policymakers engage in libya [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3557.02s)]
*  and again i hear time and time again from people that are often new to the libya file is [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3564.6200000000003s)]
*  let's engage the tribes right that's one category let's engage a town miss rata and so these [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3571.5800000000004s)]
*  categories are seen as fixed they're they're seen as acting in in cohesion and that's really [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3577.5s)]
*  not the case and so identities are malleable they're instrumentalized there's also a time [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3582.78s)]
*  component here and i want to underscore the importance of of history right and narratives [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3587.58s)]
*  and the way things are remembered and i think that's so important um coming on 10 years more [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3592.54s)]
*  than 10 years after the um revolution and so all of this suggests that we're dealing with human [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3598.54s)]
*  factors right and social factors and again that's my sort of last takeaway is you often hear [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3604.46s)]
*  among policymakers that it's all about the money right it's all about fixing libya's distribution [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3610.94s)]
*  of oil funds i've heard policymakers well we can say we can buy off the militias we can if we just [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3616.78s)]
*  funnel more money it's not about the money it's the way people remember things there are grievances [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3622.46s)]
*  at work there are identities and so these things are often very difficult to address with um [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3627.66s)]
*  traditional uh you know policy tools um again i will say i think this um this volume also highlights [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3634.14s)]
*  the limits of a local approach right you often hear in policy and mediation discuss discussions [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3644.22s)]
*  well local ceasefires we have um you know a local mediation effort in this particular town [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3649.74s)]
*  in another particular area and so this sort of ink spot approach you know that that can only [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3657.4199999999996s)]
*  get you so far again there has to be um change at the top so i think this volume really you know [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3662.7s)]
*  balances both local perspectives and national level perspectives for for policymakers and mediators [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3668.8599999999997s)]
*  thank you so much um unfortunately we are out of time and i'm sorry that we didn't get to hear [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3678.14s)]
*  final comments from visiony but first of all massive congratulations to you visiony for this [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3682.7s)]
*  really wonderful volume thank you so much to all of the panelists for being with us and thank you [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3688.06s)]
*  to the audience for joining as well i'm sure you all agree that this was really just a great [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3693.1s)]
*  contribution great conversation and i encourage you all to pick up the volume and read more so [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWfselwzLpI&t=3697.42s)]
