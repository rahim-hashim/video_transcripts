# Dunne on Instability in Egypt
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [March 24, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJot2fsOYMk)
*  Egypt is now undergoing the worst period of violence in decades. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJot2fsOYMk&t=0.0s)]
*  Data are hard to come by. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJot2fsOYMk&t=16.76s)]
*  It's an opaque situation in Egypt since the military-backed government took over from [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJot2fsOYMk&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  former president Morsi in July of 2013. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJot2fsOYMk&t=26.0s)]
*  Unnamed Egyptian officials from the Interior and the Defense Ministry recently acknowledged [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJot2fsOYMk&t=30.04s)]
*  to journalists that there are at least 16,000 Egyptians who have been imprisoned basically [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJot2fsOYMk&t=36.24s)]
*  for political reasons since last summer. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJot2fsOYMk&t=42.96s)]
*  It's a serious human rights situation and at the same time it's a serious terrorism [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJot2fsOYMk&t=47.0s)]
*  situation. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJot2fsOYMk&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  There are groups based in the Sinai, jihadi groups, that initially were focused on Israel [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJot2fsOYMk&t=55.48s)]
*  and were trying to carry out, succeeded in carrying out a few small terrorist attacks [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJot2fsOYMk&t=63.4s)]
*  in Israel. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJot2fsOYMk&t=68.67999999999999s)]
*  But as of last summer, they have become increasingly focused on attacks against the Egyptian state, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJot2fsOYMk&t=70.16s)]
*  against Egyptian police and Egyptian army. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJot2fsOYMk&t=76.84s)]
*  And there are various reasons for this, partly related to what they see as the cooperation [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJot2fsOYMk&t=80.56s)]
*  between the Egyptian army and Israel. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJot2fsOYMk&t=86.64s)]
*  So there are some big terrorist attacks going on and they have gone beyond the Sinai into [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJot2fsOYMk&t=90.24s)]
*  the Egyptian mainland. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJot2fsOYMk&t=97.17999999999999s)]
*  This is an extremely worrisome situation for stability in Egypt. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJot2fsOYMk&t=98.88s)]
*  So far it shows no signs of letting up. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJot2fsOYMk&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  And there has been no effort so far on the part of the military-backed government to [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJot2fsOYMk&t=107.12s)]
*  have a political and economic strategy that would address the root causes of instability [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJot2fsOYMk&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  in Egypt, of violence, and that would get the cooperation of the Egyptian population. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJot2fsOYMk&t=121.44s)]
