# The Taliban in Afghanistan: Political and Security Challenges
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [September 29, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0)
*  Hello, everyone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to this webinar on the political and security implications of Taliban rule in Afghanistan, which is being hosted by the Carnegie South Asia program. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=29.0s)]
*  My name is Akhil Shah. I'm a professor of South Asian politics at the University of Oklahoma and a visiting scholar in the Carnegie South Asia program for this academic year. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=39.0s)]
*  Let me take this opportunity to encourage everyone who's watching to visit the Carnegie website, Carnegie endowment dot org to sign up for South Asia, forthcoming South Asia events if you haven't already. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=49.0s)]
*  So it is truly my distinct pleasure and privilege to host this very timely and important discussion with Ahmed Rashid. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=60.0s)]
*  Emma doesn't need an introduction, but I'm going to introduce him anyway. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=69.0s)]
*  Emma Rashid is a veteran seasoned Pakistani journalist who has worked on Afghanistan and Central Asia for 40 years. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=74.0s)]
*  I mean, he worked on the Taliban in the 1990s before 9 11 before it became a car industry. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=82.0s)]
*  He's the author of amongst other books, the classic Taliban militant Islam fundamentalism and oil in Central Asia. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=91.0s)]
*  And if you haven't read the book and you want to understand the Taliban and regional dynamics, it is never too late to get a copy. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=98.0s)]
*  Emma, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=106.0s)]
*  Thank you very much indeed. Great to be here. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=109.0s)]
*  So I'll start with a series of questions and towards the end, maybe 1520 minutes will open it to questions from the audience. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=113.0s)]
*  So there's a lot to cover, but let me start with the elephant in the room. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=120.0s)]
*  Was the status quo, the so-called status quo in Afghanistan sustainable? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=124.0s)]
*  The Biden administration believes it wasn't, but we have seen some rumblings from the American military commanders claiming otherwise. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=129.0s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=138.0s)]
*  Well, quite frankly, I mean, I think, you know, if the Americans had retained a minimum of air power and two and a half, three thousand troops, it would have been a deterrent, I think. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=140.0s)]
*  But the fact is that, you know, there were mistakes on all sides. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=154.0s)]
*  The Americans pulled out even before they had pulled out their civilian diplomats and experts and the Americans pulled out their military before anything else. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=159.0s)]
*  And that was catastrophic, I think, which led to the panic of the of the final American withdrawal and the trying to get the civilians out at the last minute. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=172.0s)]
*  And so I think, you know, I mean, there've been faults all around. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=184.0s)]
*  And obviously, the Rani government has to face a lot of the blame because of the way that Ashraf Ghani fled the country and his ministers. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=188.0s)]
*  Nobody stood their ground. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=198.0s)]
*  But I think, you know, we were seeing that the Doha agreement that was carried out a year earlier had, in fact, started the whole process of demoralization of the Afghan forces, the Afghan political class. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=201.0s)]
*  I think the Afghans knew perfectly well that they were not able to sustain a government and an army to face up to the Taliban if the Americans were not going to be there. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=218.0s)]
*  OK, moving on to the Taliban, given your there's some given your deep knowledge of the Taliban leadership and what we have seen since they've captured Kabul in terms of the repression of women's protests, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=230.0s)]
*  the displacement of the Hazaras and the squabbling that we saw where the interim cabinet. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=247.0s)]
*  Do you think they can govern Afghanistan? I mean, is there a plan? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=252.0s)]
*  Well, I must say, you know, I was quite amazed to see the Taliban come back in almost exactly the same way as they came back as they took took the offensive and conquered Afghanistan in 1993, 94. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=257.0s)]
*  And, you know, I mean, the first thing that hit you was that they had to depend on their young thugs to maintain law and order in the streets of Kabul with whips and sticks. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=274.0s)]
*  They had not even nobody had even been through a process of crowd control. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=284.0s)]
*  And we saw how they handled the crowds at the airport. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=290.0s)]
*  And then I think everything is deteriorated. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=293.0s)]
*  After that, we saw women being beaten. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=296.0s)]
*  We saw a journalist being beaten. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=299.0s)]
*  And none of the it seems that none of the lessons of the nineties were learned, what was learned to talk about by the Taliban. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=302.0s)]
*  And it was very depressing to to see this and a very big shock because everyone thought the Taliban have been in, you know, the leadership has been in reclusive, but they're probably training their young kids. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=313.0s)]
*  They don't have a cater which is able to, I think, govern properly or which is modern in any any sense of the word. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=329.0s)]
*  And I think that's going to be the big problem. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=339.0s)]
*  I foresee a continued stream of demonstrations, riots, maybe not an armed opposition to the Taliban, because that would take some time to organize and many other problems. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=342.0s)]
*  But certainly, I think public dissatisfaction, the way the women have come out, you know, and today I mean, they've announced again that the Taliban have been in reclusive, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=359.0s)]
*  and again that the women will not be allowed to go to Kabul University. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=368.0s)]
*  And you have a young zealot who's become the chancellor of the university. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=372.0s)]
*  So it's a it's a very, very bad situation at the moment. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=378.0s)]
*  And the Taliban don't seem to be doing very much to rectify. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=383.0s)]
*  So do you think this is kind of a throwback to the 1990s? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=388.0s)]
*  The crucial question that everybody's been asking me is that, you know, have the Taliban changed? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=393.0s)]
*  And quite frankly, I've been saying for a long time, no, they haven't. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=399.0s)]
*  But not not because of these actions that they have taken against the public. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=403.0s)]
*  But they are there. They have a very oppressive ideology. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=408.0s)]
*  And that has not changed at all. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=414.0s)]
*  And it's like, you know, asking anyone with a firm ideological bias to drop their ideology and become liberals or something like that. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=416.0s)]
*  And what we've seen, I think there are three major factors that have sustained the Taliban in this time. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=429.0s)]
*  The first is this whole ideology that they have interpreted of their Bundy Sunni Islam, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=436.0s)]
*  which is extremely severe and strict and basically depends on punishment for being good Muslims and being Islamic. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=443.0s)]
*  In other words, we will punish everyone very severely if they cross the boundary line of who we are and what we believe in. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=455.0s)]
*  The second thing is that the is especially under the interpretation of Pashtun Valley, which I discussed in my earlier book, is completely wrong. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=464.0s)]
*  Pashtun Valley is not something aggressive. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=478.0s)]
*  And it is something that, you know, you treat the way you treat your guests, the way you behave in public. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=481.0s)]
*  And so that has not changed. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=488.0s)]
*  I mean, their interpretation of Pashtun Valley, like their interpretation of their Bundy Islam, is totally objectionable. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=491.0s)]
*  The headquarters of their Bundy is actually in India. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=500.0s)]
*  And if you if you read about them, they're the most peaceful Muslim group in India. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=503.0s)]
*  They're very conservative, but they're very peaceful at the same time. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=509.0s)]
*  So none of that has really changed. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=513.0s)]
*  And one expected that these Taliban have been in exile abroad, their children have been to university and college. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=515.0s)]
*  They would have bought in by now some younger elements of their children of the leaders, for example, to try and help them understand the modern world and govern. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=523.0s)]
*  They haven't done anything like that. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=535.0s)]
*  They know they're hardly any young people involved with the you know, with the Taliban and the older generation is still some of them have still very close links to Al Qaeda and the whole in global jihad, even though that is not the Taliban's philosophy. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=537.0s)]
*  The Taliban overall philosophy is a much more nationalistic belief in turning Afghanistan into a pure state, not necessarily trying to create a global jihad like Osama bin Laden did. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=555.0s)]
*  OK, there is a view by some in Western media on the left, but also in countries like Pakistan that outside of Kabul and Herat and other major urban centers, people have seen the Taliban return to power as a they've kind of heaved a sigh of relief because they were fed up with war and the atrocities of Afghan security forces and the human rights violation of American forces. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=575.0s)]
*  What do you think of that reading of the the rest of Afghanistan as they call it? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=603.0s)]
*  Is that is that accurate or. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=608.0s)]
*  What the real reaction has been in the countryside to the Taliban. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=613.0s)]
*  But I'll say a couple of things. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=618.0s)]
*  I think, first of all, the majority of Afghans do not like the Taliban. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=620.0s)]
*  They didn't in 93. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=625.0s)]
*  And I don't think they like it now. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=627.0s)]
*  But what they do like is an end to the fighting and the war. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=629.0s)]
*  And but of course, that has bought new hardship for the Afghan population in the in the wake of not being enough food and humanitarian crisis, economic crisis, no cash available. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=633.0s)]
*  The banks are shut down. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=646.0s)]
*  So what I again in in in village very much is, yes, there will be a welcome sigh of relief by many rural Afghans in the countryside who will now be able to at least walk or walk around without fear of getting shot. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=649.0s)]
*  But the in time, I think the Taliban's failure and this is what happened last time in in in 99. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=665.0s)]
*  There was a huge famine in Afghanistan when the Taliban were ruling and that completely demoralize the population. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=676.0s)]
*  And that actually stepped up the resistance to the Taliban when a lot of the former warlords came back and started fighting. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=685.0s)]
*  And I really something like that happening again, because the Taliban are not going to be able to produce policies which will feed the people. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=693.0s)]
*  That was the case in 93. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=703.0s)]
*  It's going to be the case very quickly, possibly within weeks and months now that the Taliban will be, you know, told to provide food and that food will not be available because of whatever sanctions. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=705.0s)]
*  A reluctance to allow NGOs, for example. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=721.0s)]
*  I mean, one of the terms of the of humanitarian aid is that NGOs and the UN should be allowed to distribute that rather than the Taliban, because the fear is that it's food distributed by the Taliban will just go into their military wing rather than anything else. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=724.0s)]
*  So they they have to be that there has to be an acceptance of the role of NGOs in the United Nations, which again, the Taliban are probably not going to accept. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=742.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=758.0s)]
*  So just moving ahead to the issue of counterterrorism and the Taliban have repeatedly showed international community. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=761.0s)]
*  Can you hear me? Yeah, yeah. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=769.0s)]
*  Yeah, that we will not. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=772.0s)]
*  We will not allow Afghan soil to be used for terrorism against other countries. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=775.0s)]
*  What does that mean in practice? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=779.0s)]
*  I mean, how do you think they'll deal with Al Qaeda and the assortment of foreign and local militants that are present in Afghanistan? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=781.0s)]
*  Well, I think, you know, this is a really important question. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=788.0s)]
*  And again, my answer is, first of all, how does the West suggest that they deal with them? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=791.0s)]
*  Do you want the Taliban to shoot Al Qaeda, execute them? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=796.0s)]
*  Do you want to put them in jail? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=800.0s)]
*  Do you want to put them in a safe house? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=801.0s)]
*  What is the answer for these these these bad guys? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=803.0s)]
*  Because the problem is that the Taliban have a sense of loyalty to them. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=807.0s)]
*  They have fought for the Taliban. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=812.0s)]
*  They were deeply involved in this recent offensive, which took place, you know, allowing them to enter Kabul. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=814.0s)]
*  They have fought and died for the Taliban. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=822.0s)]
*  The Taliban are not going to be in a position to suddenly turn against these militant groups and say, I'm going to get rid of you now, because, you know, the Americans want me to get rid of you and the world community does. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=824.0s)]
*  So, unfortunately, what we are going to see is is probably these people will be told to lie low for the time being, not to do anything provocative. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=837.0s)]
*  But we saw in the case of Bin Laden. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=848.0s)]
*  I mean, he had also been told to lie low and not to do anything provocative after the bombing of the embassies in Tanzania and Kenya. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=850.0s)]
*  And yet, you know, he did 9-11. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=860.0s)]
*  And, you know, many of the Taliban were very angry at him for doing that. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=862.0s)]
*  So there's a real conundrum here. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=869.0s)]
*  How do you deal with these groups? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=872.0s)]
*  How do you get the Taliban to deal with these groups? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=875.0s)]
*  What would you suggest as to how you deal with these groups? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=878.0s)]
*  It's a huge problem, which is not going to be just dealt with by the Americans saying, you know, the Taliban's responsibility is to do this. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=882.0s)]
*  The Taliban have to have to have a way out. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=894.0s)]
*  I mean, how are they going to deal with these people without antagonizing them and leading to a new kind of civil war? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=898.0s)]
*  But that brings me to Pakistan's neighbor from hell, Pakistan. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=905.0s)]
*  We know that the military wanted Pakistan's military leadership wanted strategic depth against India. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=912.0s)]
*  It has gotten that. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=919.0s)]
*  But at the same time, the Taliban have not been very helpful with helping Pakistan contain the Taliban Pakistan, which is a major internal security threat to Pakistan. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=921.0s)]
*  So the question is, what is now the nature and limits of Pakistani influence or leverage over the Taliban? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=932.0s)]
*  Well, you know, I think it's being reduced all the time. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=941.0s)]
*  I mean, simply the first element about TTP is, yes, I think sensible people in Pakistan were warning the government and the military that the Taliban are not likely to suddenly become very obliging to Pakistan. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=945.0s)]
*  They want to distance themselves from Pakistan. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=961.0s)]
*  They want to show that they're independent of Pakistan and that what they've achieved, they've achieved on their own without any help from Pakistan. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=964.0s)]
*  So the last thing they're going to do is to start killing TTP or rounding them up. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=971.0s)]
*  So I think that's that's the first point and very important, which is we're not going to see the Taliban government in Kabul obliging the Pakistanis. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=978.0s)]
*  Excessively, whichever way we look, and Pakistan has not raised many issues regarding the social. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=990.0s)]
*  I mean, it wants a better cabinet than the Taliban, but it has not raised issues like women and other social issues, which would perhaps annoy the Taliban. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=999.0s)]
*  The Taliban are doing their best to keep a fairly straightforward relationship. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1012.0s)]
*  They they raised the Kashmir issue with Indians, something that was probably liked a lot in Islamabad. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1017.0s)]
*  They've you know, they've asked the Taliban to form a more inclusive government. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1025.0s)]
*  I think what we've seen in the last couple of weeks has been a shift in Pakistan's policy from just blindly supporting the Taliban to being much more in sync with the international community. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1032.0s)]
*  So, for example, it's very clear now that the Pakistanis will not be recognizing the Taliban government in a hurry, and they would like a group of like minded countries and allies of Pakistan, China, Russia, Iran to maybe do this recognition business together. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1045.0s)]
*  And none of these countries are want to do it in opposition to the international community. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1065.0s)]
*  So I think what we are going to see is a Pakistan hesitating and not being not recognizing the Taliban government quickly, nor will these other countries unless we see progress on the Taliban front and the international community actually allowing humanitarian aid and other kind of money aid and money to do at least the NGO and the civil society community in Afghanistan. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1072.0s)]
*  So I think Pakistan's policy is suddenly suddenly changed a bit. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1100.0s)]
*  And I think the I've got a message here saying turn your volume down on your computer. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1105.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1114.0s)]
*  Anyway, yeah, once. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1116.0s)]
*  Is that better? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1120.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1122.0s)]
*  Is that better? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1124.0s)]
*  Is that better? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1126.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1127.0s)]
*  So I think I think Pakistan's policy is a bit more in sync now with the international community. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1128.0s)]
*  But at the same time, it can't take the risk of annoying the Taliban by trying to take the position that for example the Americans and the Europeans have, which is, as far as the Taliban are concerned, a very extreme position of opposition. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1134.0s)]
*  We are now faced with a huge economic crisis in Afghanistan, and it has to be seen that you know how the West tackles that. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1151.0s)]
*  And perhaps it would be a good idea for the West to encourage four or five countries to recognize the Taliban government so that aid can flow. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1160.0s)]
*  And perhaps that could be followed up by other other countries later on. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1171.0s)]
*  But I don't unfortunately see concessions on the social issues like women and education and that and that is really, I mean, the Taliban is just dropping a big stone on their foot every time they announce something derogatory about the role of women. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1175.0s)]
*  So Pakistan is selling this idea of an inclusive government and the Taliban have also pledged that they'll create an elusive government. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1196.0s)]
*  Do you think it's even possible for an inclusive Taliban government given that you know it's a concept alien to their default governance model, which is, you know, a centralized dictatorship run by an Amir and Momineen. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1205.0s)]
*  So what would inclusive government mean short of a consultative process or an election for that matter? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1219.0s)]
*  Well, in their latest additions to the cabinet, they've tried to their interpretation of inclusive is that we we do not just form a Pashtun government, but we form a multi ethnic government. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1227.0s)]
*  And there are a few that are too tragic. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1240.0s)]
*  There's an Uzbek, there's a Hazara now in the government. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1243.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, the cabinet is now about 55 people and, you know, they've appointed about five people belonging to the ethnic minorities, which is hardly enough to satisfy anyone. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1246.0s)]
*  And anyway, these ethnic minorities representatives are also very close to the Taliban. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1259.0s)]
*  I think one the interpretation of inclusive means for the West is that there should be people from the past government, perhaps technocrats, who know something about governance, et cetera. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1265.0s)]
*  And so far, as you know, very well, we've not seen any attempt to improve governance, to establish new rules of behavior. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1277.0s)]
*  What is the government going to do economically? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1288.0s)]
*  How is it going to get cash? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1291.0s)]
*  How is it going to treat the neighbors, et cetera? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1293.0s)]
*  We haven't seen any attempt yet of the Taliban moving into this policy making framework. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1296.0s)]
*  And I'm trying to enlist the help of perhaps technical people who would know something about it. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1305.0s)]
*  The other thing is that don't forget that there is, I think, tensions within the Taliban. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1311.0s)]
*  And certainly, the Taliban expected their leaders to announce precisely this kind of government that we have seen now already, meaning a hard line from 100 percent Taliban government, no concessions to the former politicians, no concessions to the warlords or anyone else. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1317.0s)]
*  But, you know, but this is not really going to work very well, frankly. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1338.0s)]
*  It's not going to be effective. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1343.0s)]
*  And it's going to probably increase the squabbling between moderates who could be brother and the more extreme groups like the Hakanis who want control over everything, basically. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1345.0s)]
*  There are four Hakanis in the cabinet and they certainly will have they have the run of the mill at the moment. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1363.0s)]
*  So I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm not particularly hopeful that the Taliban are going to wake up one morning and decide that, you know, we've got to play the tune that the West is setting and that for our own good, we need an inclusive government. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1369.0s)]
*  We need to impress the people of our country. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1385.0s)]
*  We are not anti this group or that group. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1388.0s)]
*  Is there any leverage given that, you know, the Taliban are now in power and maybe they don't need a physical sanctuary in Pakistan? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1391.0s)]
*  So what what are the sort of mechanisms or levers of Pakistani influence left for them to be able to do that? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1400.0s)]
*  I mean, Pakistan is sent in one of the first countries to send in truckloads of humanitarian aid. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1410.0s)]
*  They have flown the first private airplane, the Pakistan International Airlines. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1420.0s)]
*  I mean, these small steps and they have they have said senior officials to Pakistan to to Afghanistan. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1428.0s)]
*  But, you know, I think the influence is going to get less and less because, as I said earlier, the Taliban, it's in the Taliban interest to be able to do that. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1438.0s)]
*  And the Taliban don't want to do anything. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1447.0s)]
*  And there is a lot of opposition inside the country to the role that Pakistan has played in the past in backing the Taliban going back to 1993 and then again in the last few years. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1450.0s)]
*  Which seems the Americans were asleep when that was happening or they were busy in Iraq when when when that was happening. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1461.0s)]
*  And I think that's the kind of influence that Pakistan has played in the past in backing the Taliban. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1469.0s)]
*  So, influence, I think, is going to diminish more and more if the Taliban are going to persist in this form of government governance and this this particular type of cabinet. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1478.0s)]
*  And they're going to snub the West and defy the West and then they're going to be able to do that. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1490.0s)]
*  And if the people are starving, well, you know, I mean, so what if you want to help them, you help them by giving us food, etc. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1494.0s)]
*  So I fear very much that the Taliban are going to be very hard-line and very, very hard-line. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1502.0s)]
*  And I think that's the kind of influence that Pakistan has played in the past in backing the Taliban. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1510.0s)]
*  But that influence is diminishing, I think, pretty fast. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1516.0s)]
*  Hukani Network is in or leaders of the Hukani Network are in important part of the Taliban. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1521.0s)]
*  I think that's the kind of influence that Pakistan has played in this country, and certainly as a country with the most influence in the world. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1528.0s)]
*  Hukani network is in or leaders of the Hukani network are in important positions in the [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1538.0s)]
*  cabinet. And as you know, the Hukani have a you know, interest in Pakistan, real estate [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1546.76s)]
*  interests, their families and children live there. Is that leverage that can't be used [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1552.52s)]
*  or the Taliban don't really care or what? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1559.86s)]
*  I mean, some of the leaders certainly have come back into Afghanistan, but we haven't [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1567.28s)]
*  heard anything about the families. When will they when will these Taliban family in the [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1571.8s)]
*  leadership families actually come back into Afghanistan and start living there? At the [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1577.44s)]
*  moment, that hasn't happened. And it surely has happened. And I think that's the reason [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1584.08s)]
*  why we're so concerned about the Taliban. And I think that's the reason why we're so [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1589.24s)]
*  At the moment, that hasn't happened. And it surely has to happen if the Taliban are going [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1594.3200000000002s)]
*  to retain any kind of credibility with the with the Afghan population. And if they are [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1598.72s)]
*  going to try and persuade people that they are distancing themselves from Pakistan and [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1605.1200000000001s)]
*  Iran, too, I mean, there are large numbers of Taliban leaders in Iran. And so, you know, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1611.92s)]
*  I think this the role of foreign influence of the neighbors, except for the wealthy [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1620.8s)]
*  neighbors, in other words, China and Russia, is going to diminish. Remember, the Taliban's [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1626.8s)]
*  friends are all bankrupt at the moment. I mean, Pakistan, Iran, these are the two closest [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1632.1599999999999s)]
*  countries, they can't help the Taliban in any way, because they have their own economies [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1639.84s)]
*  completely depressed and under pressure. China and Russia are not going to take any step on their [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1644.88s)]
*  own. They're not going to jump in, because the Chinese they've both learned from past experiences [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1652.16s)]
*  that you have to be very careful with the Afghans. And you can't steamroller them into [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1659.68s)]
*  accepting something, even though the Taliban have frequently mentioned the role of China, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1667.44s)]
*  and the money and the rebuilding that China has promised to do. But China is not going to do this. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1672.72s)]
*  If this kind of situation remains in Afghanistan, and the entire world remains [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1680.72s)]
*  unwilling to help the Taliban. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1691.04s)]
*  That you brought China, what is China's kind of calculus in Afghanistan in terms of, you know, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1692.48s)]
*  their concerns of their militants, the bigger militants who they're really concerned about, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1704.88s)]
*  and the violence and militancy that can emanate from Afghanistan? Is that one of the sticking [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1710.4s)]
*  points, or you think? Well, I mean, the Chinese seem to have worked that out, because at this very [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1716.48s)]
*  important meeting in Beijing between the Chinese Foreign Minister Mullah Bratir, Mullah Bratir [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1724.56s)]
*  announced publicly that the Uighurs would not be supported by the Taliban, especially those Uighurs [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1732.8s)]
*  living in Afghanistan. And there are several hundred Uighurs living in Afghanistan who've [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1739.84s)]
*  been fighting for the Taliban. Again, we go back to this problem of what, you know, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1745.28s)]
*  if the Taliban are seen to be imprisoning or killing or jailing the Uighur militants who are [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1750.48s)]
*  in Afghanistan, it's going to go down very badly with many of the Taliban, the Afghan Taliban, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1758.24s)]
*  and go down very badly with the Islamic community in general. So they're really trapped here. They [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1764.8s)]
*  want Chinese help. They want Chinese money. They want China to take a major role in exploiting the [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1771.68s)]
*  mineral resources of Afghanistan. But they'll have to stick to this, and the Chinese will be watching [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1778.0800000000002s)]
*  them very closely, that, you know, will they adhere to this promise not to help the Uighurs? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1783.92s)]
*  I think they will, but they will create more problems for themselves, because the Uighur [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1790.8s)]
*  population in Afghanistan is likely to resist. And so we are faced again, I mean, the Taliban [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1795.2s)]
*  are faced again, once again, with this conundrum as to what to do with militant groups. China's [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1804.64s)]
*  role has become less and less. China, three years ago, China was playing a major role even in trying [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1810.8s)]
*  to broker a peace settlement. The Chinese met with the Taliban, who had been bought to meet them by [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1817.76s)]
*  Pakistan. Pakistan was very keen that China promised the Chinese that they would help in the [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1827.2s)]
*  peace process. China got deeply involved, and then I think China realized that nothing was happening. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1835.76s)]
*  And it was all talk, and there was really no compromise between these parties, the government [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1843.44s)]
*  in Kabul or the Taliban. And as long as there was no compromise, you know, China's role would [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1849.28s)]
*  become more and more difficult. And the Chinese pulled out, basically, from any peacekeeping role, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1858.3200000000002s)]
*  peacemaking role, that they had allotted to themselves. They pulled out and stood on the [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1862.88s)]
*  sidelines and watched Doha and watched everything else that was happening between the Americans and [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1869.68s)]
*  the Taliban without playing much of a role themselves. So right now, I think the Chinese [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1875.92s)]
*  are obviously pleased that the Americans have left Afghanistan, that the Americans have come, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1883.1200000000001s)]
*  have shown to be extremely incompetent as far as withdrawal has been concerned. But [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1889.28s)]
*  the Chinese at the same time are not going to get involved prematurely when there's still no [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1896.6399999999999s)]
*  real peace settlement or anything else. What about Russia? You mentioned Russia, but also [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1903.6s)]
*  the Central Asian countries, primarily Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. What do you think their responses [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1911.04s)]
*  will be as the Taliban, you know, are unable to, let's say, there's already talk of the Tajik [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1916.96s)]
*  militants going into Tajikistan to fight the Tajik government. So what do you think their response is? [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1922.88s)]
*  Well, no, the Tajiks are in a particular position because of the very large Tajik population, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1928.64s)]
*  more than 20 percent in Afghanistan. And of course, the Tajik opposition right now is being led by the [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1934.8000000000002s)]
*  son of Ahmad Shah Massoud. And a lot of the Afghan Tajiks have, after the defeat in the Panshir Valley, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1941.68s)]
*  in the last few weeks, a lot of them have taken shelter. As far as we know, the Vice President, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1949.84s)]
*  Saleh, Amrullah Saleh is in Tajikistan. I can only presume that so is the son of Ahmad Shah Massoud. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1957.6s)]
*  Also there, but we don't know in a confirmed way. But clearly, the Tajiks are going to give shelter [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1967.2s)]
*  to any Tajik, Afghan Tajik opposition that emerges. The other countries are playing a less of a role. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1976.56s)]
*  They're very scared of refugees flooding into their country. They've shut their borders. The Uzbeks [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1985.36s)]
*  in particular, they don't want Afghan Uzbeks flooding into their borders or Afghans of any kind. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1991.4399999999998s)]
*  And their role in this airlift has been very minimal, especially when you hear about countries [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=1999.68s)]
*  like Albania and Italy being very gracious hosts to Afghan refugees. But that is not the case with [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2005.2s)]
*  these neighbors, who after all, they share ethnicity. They share ethnic brotherhood with [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2014.32s)]
*  many of the ethnic groups in Afghanistan. So far, it's been very difficult for them to get [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2020.08s)]
*  so far, at least they haven't responded to helping the Afghan refugees or even taking in [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2028.32s)]
*  Afghan refugees. And certainly they're worried. I mean, I remember very well the panic in Tashkent [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2035.6799999999998s)]
*  when the Taliban took Kabul and started moving northwards to take Mazar-e-Sharif. And I was in [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2043.36s)]
*  Tashkent at the time and there was absolute panic in the government. They had no idea who these [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2052.16s)]
*  people were, the Taliban. And now I think that they're feeling much more secure. Russia is the [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2057.04s)]
*  backup for all of them. The Russian military is very much involved in securing the border with [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2063.68s)]
*  Afghanistan. So I think they're in a much stronger position, but they're not necessarily going to [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2069.68s)]
*  help in the peace process or even in the refugee process that we're going to see. And I think that [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2078.24s)]
*  that's sad. Other people have been doing their bit for the Afghan refugees and the Central Asians [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2087.44s)]
*  are really not accepting to do it. You brought up Amrullah Saleh and Ahmad Masood. Is there any hope [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2094.56s)]
*  for an effective resistance from the panchiris or Tajiks, especially in the absence of any tangible [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2102.32s)]
*  external support? Well, I think the resistance that erupted immediately after the Taliban takeover [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2109.52s)]
*  of Kabul has now been defeated basically and driven out of panchiris and probably in exile [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2119.44s)]
*  in Tajikistan or in areas further north. So for the time being, I don't think we're going to see [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2129.12s)]
*  an armed resistance, but I still believe that there's going to be a lot more people's resistance. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2137.68s)]
*  The other day there was a massive demonstration in Kandahar, the heartland of the Taliban [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2148.08s)]
*  and the origins of the whole Taliban movement. People were protesting that the Taliban leaders [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2155.12s)]
*  had come in and confiscated flats and houses that they occupied. So, you know, any misstep by the [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2160.96s)]
*  Taliban, and it's quite likely that they will be creating problems for themselves, any misstep by [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2171.04s)]
*  the Taliban is going to be met by public anger and resistance. And I think, you know, one extremely [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2177.84s)]
*  negative aspect of the Taliban so far has been that every time Western nations or neighboring [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2187.44s)]
*  states have said something positive, such as, you know, we will provide humanitarian aid or [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2194.48s)]
*  we're trying to keep people, NGOs active and trying to bring the UN back or anything [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2199.68s)]
*  remotely positive has been immediately countermanded by the Taliban with a very negative statement [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2207.2000000000003s)]
*  and some measure they take which immediately annoys everyone. So, for example, I mean, when [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2215.7599999999998s)]
*  you know the women are now barred from the Kabul University, just when there's talk about humanitarian [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2223.12s)]
*  aid coming into Afghanistan and so they really seem to be knocking themselves out with every [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2230.56s)]
*  measure they take. And this, of course, can be a deliberate policy of basically snubbing the West [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2241.4399999999996s)]
*  and saying we're not interested in your help or your aid. Now, it hasn't come to that yet, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2248.48s)]
*  but it may well do. Well, we also know that there's a kind of looming, the UN calls it a looming [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2253.9199999999996s)]
*  humanitarian catastrophe. So, there is this dilemma, isn't it, that, you know, the international [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2261.52s)]
*  community wants to send urgent humanitarian aid to Afghanistan, but they're also aware of, you [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2266.8s)]
*  know, the trade-off, which is that the money falls into the hands of the Taliban and it kind of [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2272.5600000000004s)]
*  empowers and legitimizes the Taliban. So, what do you think would be a way to address sort of a [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2277.92s)]
*  find a middle ground between these two problems? I think, you know, the lead role should be played [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2284.7200000000003s)]
*  by the UN and even at the political level, I think the lead role should be played by the UN now. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2293.76s)]
*  I think the Americans need to step back a little bit and not try and even the neighboring countries [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2301.92s)]
*  would welcome a much stronger UN presence. Now, if you look back at Doha, the fact was that the UN was [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2310.4s)]
*  totally ignored by the Americans in Doha. It had hardly any role to play whatsoever, even though [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2317.68s)]
*  the UN is still respected and unlike by many Afghans. And, of course, it's got both a political [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2326.48s)]
*  arm and a humanitarian arm. And the UN is in a much stronger position to do a synchronization [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2333.44s)]
*  of these two arms and be able to bring the two together, humanitarian and political, and convince [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2339.52s)]
*  the Taliban to compromise, convince the Western international community to compromise and come up [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2346.4s)]
*  with something that at least would feed, basically feed the Afghan people. It has been, I think, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2353.6s)]
*  very self-destructive of the Americans not to have included the UN much earlier on at a much more [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2359.36s)]
*  high level of, especially in the negotiations in Doha. And we just haven't seen that, unfortunately. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2367.36s)]
*  They appointed an ambassador, Jean Arnaud, a very, very reputable UN mediator, who was then ignored [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2377.84s)]
*  by the Americans and ignored by everyone. And there was no passage of his authority in the [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2387.68s)]
*  Security Council or debate about what he should be doing. And, you know, it's unfortunate, but the [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2395.68s)]
*  Secretary General also has really not played the role that was expected of him in this whole crisis. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2403.12s)]
*  We haven't heard much from the Secretary General of the UN for the last month or two. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2413.44s)]
*  So your advice to President Biden would be to do no harm. I mean, as you point out, American [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2419.84s)]
*  unilateralism has been kind of the prominent feature of this crisis in Afghanistan. So what [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2427.04s)]
*  would you say to President Biden if he asked you for your advice on how to deal with the Taliban? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2436.56s)]
*  I hardly want to give Biden any advice, but certainly the faults that we have seen [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2442.88s)]
*  in the last four or five weeks have been pretty catastrophic for the whole Western efforts. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2448.24s)]
*  The faults of the big powers, the fact that there was no initial [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2455.2s)]
*  consultant consulting with NATO, the Europeans were completely upset with the Americans, the fact that [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2459.7599999999998s)]
*  there was the withdrawal of the American troops before the civilians were withdrawn, which was, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2468.56s)]
*  in military terms, the most shameful thing you can do. The whole American saga of never leave [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2475.28s)]
*  anyone behind, etc., was a joke. I mean, the entire embassy was left behind while the pullout [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2481.28s)]
*  of the 3,000 troops was taking place. And it was so chaotic that then Biden had to send in 6,000 [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2489.28s)]
*  troops in order to allow the withdrawal to take place. So I mean, there's a lot of people who [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2496.2400000000002s)]
*  have been, you know, all these faults. But we have to go back to Doha because, you know, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2505.6s)]
*  Doha was a very flawed agreement. It was an agreement that did not include the Afghan government, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2511.2799999999997s)]
*  and it completely demoralized and disillusioned the Afghan cabinet, the ministers, the politicians [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2520.56s)]
*  in the country. How would the Afghan salvage anything from the Doha agreement when the Americans [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2527.7599999999998s)]
*  refusing to include them in any consultation? I think that was a huge mistake. And I think, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2535.44s)]
*  secondly, I think there has been, there was a moderate Taliban that did want a settlement, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2543.84s)]
*  that wanted a peaceful settlement. And we don't know exactly how they were treated by the Americans [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2550.56s)]
*  and how they were treated by their fellow Taliban, but they should have been strengthened. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2558.2400000000002s)]
*  Their whole position should have been strengthened rather than ignored. I think the UN should be [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2563.2799999999997s)]
*  still playing a major role, especially in food and distribution and civil society. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2570.08s)]
*  And again, we see a little sign of the Americans accepting that. And the Americans should provide [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2577.9199999999996s)]
*  the aircraft or whatever is needed for an airlift of supplies to the Afghans. I mean, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2585.28s)]
*  the last thing that could really destroy, undermine everything would be famine in Afghanistan [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2593.52s)]
*  and people dying of hunger and pictures like we saw in Ethiopia and Sudan and other places [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2603.76s)]
*  happening in Afghanistan. I mean, that really would be disastrous, I think. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2610.88s)]
*  Well, I wanted to pursue the moderate Taliban narrative, but I think it's time to take questions [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2618.48s)]
*  from the audience. We have a question here that says Afghanistan is not the same place [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2627.6800000000003s)]
*  as the last time the Taliban took control. How will the Taliban govern in the context of [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2635.36s)]
*  social change, especially in regard to women's rights? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2640.4s)]
*  You know, there are a number of facts that have to be acknowledged. The first is that the whole [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2646.0s)]
*  issue of women's rights is an urban phenomenon. It is not, I mean, certainly girls are going to [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2650.4s)]
*  school in the rural areas as well. And there's been a huge influx of girls going to school. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2656.56s)]
*  But at the same time, the battle for women's rights is being fought in the cities. It's not [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2661.6s)]
*  necessarily being fought in the countryside. Secondly, there's been, you know, to see every [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2667.84s)]
*  Taliban now with a cell phone, with an iPhone is quite remarkable for me, especially because [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2674.7200000000003s)]
*  I had such a, it was impossible to even photograph the Taliban when back in 93, 94. And, you know, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2680.96s)]
*  I was shocked because the Mujahideen love being photographed. And, you know, they all wanted to [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2689.76s)]
*  be photographed with their guns and macho sort of positions. And then I came across the Taliban [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2695.76s)]
*  who refused to have any pictures taken. And now we are seeing the Taliban shooting their own pictures. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2704.0800000000004s)]
*  And they realized, I think that, you know, obviously media is a great step forward. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2708.96s)]
*  They are trying to curb the media, the TV especially, but they also are trying to keep [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2715.6000000000004s)]
*  it running because they know the importance. Last time they had ignored the television and they had, [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2721.04s)]
*  in fact, beaten, they'd taken televisions out of people's houses and strung them up on lampposts [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2728.4s)]
*  just to show how much they hated TV. Things are, you're absolutely right, things are very different [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2736.56s)]
*  now. But how much change has there been in the Taliban attitude? I mean, shouldn't they have [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2742.88s)]
*  worked out a policy towards women education before coming into power? Shouldn't they have worked out [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2748.88s)]
*  a policy towards crowd control and controlling riots and demonstrations in a more peaceful [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2756.88s)]
*  manner than what they do at present? Should they still be going around beating people and whipping [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2764.88s)]
*  women and men like they did last time? And it's incredible to see that the Taliban have really not [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2770.56s)]
*  focused at all on these, you know, as a political movement, they have not focused at all on the [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2781.7599999999998s)]
*  politics of maintaining law and order, providing governance, et cetera. And so I fear that the [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2788.16s)]
*  Taliban are only going to look after themselves. That means that, you know, anything that arrives [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2794.72s)]
*  from donors from the West, concessions, it will be about the Taliban and feeding them and looking, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2800.8799999999997s)]
*  making sure that their soldiers are looked after and fed rather than real attempts at governance [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2807.2799999999997s)]
*  and policy making. I don't think we're going to see that for quite some time. We're not going to [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2814.56s)]
*  see new policies emerge and we're not going to see good governance. Thanks, Emin. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2819.92s)]
*  We have another question, an important one, I believe. Is there any hope or venue for negotiations [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2826.8s)]
*  for a future, more permanent political system with the Taliban in power? [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2832.48s)]
*  You know, the Taliban don't believe in sharing power. I mean, this was very clear in 96 when they [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2836.48s)]
*  took Kabul. It's very clear when they took Kabul again a month ago. They've been forced to take on [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2851.92s)]
*  a few of the non-Pashtuns, non-Taliban people, but it's a handful with people with very little [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2858.64s)]
*  authority and very little power. So I'm very pessimistic. I don't see the Taliban really [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2864.88s)]
*  adopting towards a more plural, semi-democratic system, you know, bringing in people from the [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2874.1600000000003s)]
*  outside, bringing in technical people. And, you know, so countries that will want to invest in [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2883.52s)]
*  Afghanistan like the Chinese are going to find life very difficult, I think. It's not going to [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2891.28s)]
*  be easy to help the Taliban. They're going to be very reluctant to accept help. And that was the [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2899.52s)]
*  case before. It's the case now. As I said, I mean, every positive step by the international [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2907.44s)]
*  community is met by some negative measure that they take. And that completely degrades the whole [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2912.5600000000004s)]
*  gesture of friendship that people are trying to give them. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2921.52s)]
*  The next question from the audience is, what was Pakistan's specific role in getting the [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2930.88s)]
*  Haqqanis into the Afghan government? And if I might add, you recall that the director general [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2936.8s)]
*  of the ISI, General Fass, there's this famous photo of him enjoying a cup of tea and telling [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2942.48s)]
*  British journalists, don't worry, everything will be fine. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2948.64s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you know, I don't know to what extent the Pakistanis influenced the Haqqanis coming in. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2953.68s)]
*  But I think there are several indicators. There's been no regret that Mullah Bratir is no longer [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2962.56s)]
*  in the same powerful position that he was during Doha. And he was considered to be, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2971.52s)]
*  he is considered to be one of the more moderate elements of the Taliban and who believes in [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2977.52s)]
*  negotiations. I think, you know, a broader leadership would have been, you know, I think [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2984.3199999999997s)]
*  the Taliban would probably have entered into talks with the West about food supplies and about all [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2991.7599999999998s)]
*  these kinds of things. But it's difficult if you're a Western diplomat or an American diplomat to talk [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=2998.64s)]
*  to the Haqqanis. And the Haqqanis want legitimacy and they want to be reinstalled as leading actors [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3006.08s)]
*  in Afghanistan's politics. And the fact of the matter is that the Taliban don't seem to realize [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3015.92s)]
*  that that can't happen. And the Haqqanis are not a viable partner for Americans, Pakistan, or anyone [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3022.72s)]
*  else. They can be bored into a settlement for the time being, but they can't be the lead actor. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3033.92s)]
*  And they want to be the lead actor. And that's why we've seen that they're occupying these key [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3044.56s)]
*  positions of the cabinet. And they're determined to get the Americans to lift the no-fly, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3049.84s)]
*  no-fly zone and no-fly rule against them. They want to be able to travel and go to [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3060.08s)]
*  Saudi Arabia and back. Now, it's very unlikely that, you know, the Taliban may give them permission [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3067.84s)]
*  to do that, but it's very unlikely that Western countries will. I mean, I'm quite stunned because, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3074.56s)]
*  again, the Taliban have just dropped another stone on their foot. I mean, maybe the Haqqanis [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3080.96s)]
*  pushed their way into these very prominent positions in the cabinet, but it's going to turn [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3086.96s)]
*  out to be a very disastrous case for the Taliban to have these as your front and side representatives [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3093.52s)]
*  trying to negotiate with Western countries. Just a follow-up, shouldn't Pakistan be more pleased [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3104.88s)]
*  with the Haqqanis in the cabinet or is it the Haqqanis are not really under any kind of [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3114.56s)]
*  obligation to listen to what Pakistan wants? I think there's certainly there's that element that [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3124.08s)]
*  I don't think any Afghan is going to be listening that much to Pakistan now than they did before. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3130.4s)]
*  The next step which you might see, which will probably shock everyone in Pakistan, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3138.56s)]
*  will be the Haqqanis meeting with the Indian ambassador after having attacked the Indian [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3142.88s)]
*  embassy in Kabul several times. As I said, I think Pakistan's influence is going to be limited and [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3148.08s)]
*  anyone seemed to be trying to insert the Haqqanis into the mainstream negotiations with the West, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3161.84s)]
*  with the UN, with the neighboring countries, with the Chinese are going to be faced with [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3169.28s)]
*  a real criticism from their fellow countries. You mentioned India, I mean it has been a kind of a [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3177.0400000000004s)]
*  shock for India. India invested something to the tune of three to four billion dollars in [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3187.28s)]
*  reconstruction and aid in Afghanistan and now all of that is gone. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3194.0800000000004s)]
*  What do you see India's option or response should be to what's happening under the Taliban? [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3199.84s)]
*  Yeah, I think what has happened is India is a very clear loser in what has happened, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3206.88s)]
*  but India is still saying that they will continue aid to Afghanistan. They will strike, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3214.0800000000004s)]
*  it's going to be very difficult for them to deal with the Taliban. They will be waiting for another, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3220.7999999999997s)]
*  perhaps a more moderate version of the Taliban in government, a different kind of government, [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3227.2s)]
*  but at the moment clearly they've lost out and there's been a lot of hand-wringing in Delhi [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3233.84s)]
*  as to how narrow-minded the Indian policy has been over the years by refusing to recognize [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3238.64s)]
*  the Taliban and linking everything to, linking the Taliban to Kashmir and linking Pakistan's role to [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3245.28s)]
*  Kashmir, which really has not, it's a very important part of the puzzle for Pakistan, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3254.1600000000003s)]
*  but it's not part of the puzzle for the Afghans and for the Indians to think that the Afghans [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3262.32s)]
*  are totally preoccupied with liberating Kashmir or turning it over to Pakistan. It's just not true, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3268.88s)]
*  it's wishful thinking, it's far from the truth. Afghans, I've been meeting Afghans from all sides [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3278.56s)]
*  and they have enough problems of their own without getting involved in Kashmir. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3287.04s)]
*  And so unfortunately, but the fact that Pakistan makes the Indians are sabotaging [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3292.24s)]
*  Pakistan through Afghanistan and that they are, even the TTP, the Pakistani Taliban [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3299.6s)]
*  are being funded by India, I don't think the TTP need to be funded by India. They're heavily involved [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3307.6s)]
*  in the drugs trade, they're dealing with all the illegal economic smuggling that is taking place [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3314.8s)]
*  from Afghanistan. They are not short of money, weapons or anything else. So yes, I mean, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3321.44s)]
*  very possible that the Indians are also funding them, but it's more likely that elements in [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3331.92s)]
*  Afghanistan are funding them, in particular the Taliban, the Afghan Taliban and other splinter [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3337.6s)]
*  groups that have emerged. So I mean, I think we have to adopt greater realism. India is a part [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3346.64s)]
*  of the region, it is not a neighbour of Afghanistan, but it will have to be accommodated in some way, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3356.08s)]
*  because India again is too powerful a neighbour to leave out. And the Western countries and the [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3362.56s)]
*  international community is certainly going to involve India in the deliberations on Afghanistan. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3369.28s)]
*  So you can't do away with that all of a sudden. Well, I think we're almost close to 11 o'clock. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3375.52s)]
*  Just a question, if you know, Ahmad, you've probably been asked this before, this has crossed your [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3386.96s)]
*  mind. Should we be looking forward to a 2021 edition of the Taliban book? And if so, what would [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3392.0s)]
*  you say? Well, actually, two of my books, Descent into Chaos and Taliban are being reissued by my [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3396.96s)]
*  publishers with a new forward. And both of them will have new forwards. So that's very encouraging. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3406.72s)]
*  Apparently they're sold out everywhere. People are trying to get their hands on Taliban. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3414.72s)]
*  The Taliban book is still very relevant because, you know, the why and wherefore of the Taliban is [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3420.0s)]
*  very much the same as it was 20 years ago. And, you know, the geopolitics has changed and [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3426.88s)]
*  the politics of some of the warlords has changed, but not the Taliban. They're very consistent. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3434.6400000000003s)]
*  OK, Ahmad, I really want to acknowledge again, thank you so much for giving us your time and [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3442.2400000000002s)]
*  your thoughts and your analysis. I really appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you very much. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3449.36s)]
*  Bye. Bye. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVTzji1c_0&t=3456.24s)]
