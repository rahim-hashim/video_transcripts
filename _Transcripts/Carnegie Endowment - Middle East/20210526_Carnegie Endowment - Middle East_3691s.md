Video Description: The Biden Administration has announced its intent to downsize the U.S. military presence in the Middle East to deal with a rising China. Yet even after years of a heavy American military footprint and blockbuster arms deals, the security and welfare of Arab citizens is still marginal at best. As the United States prepares to pivot to Asia, how can the U.S. pursue a more holistic reduction strategy in the Middle East that addresses the region's growing nontraditional threats and socioeconomic challenges inside Arab states?

Carnegie’s Middle East Program invites you to a public discussion marking the release of a new edited volume, “From Hardware to Holism: Re-balancing U.S. Security Engagement with Arab States” which offers fresh proposals for a new U.S. strategy in the region that balances the military component of U.S. power with more sustainable and effective tools. Frederic Wehrey, Michele Dunne, and Emile Hokayem will present the study’s key findings, with a keynote address by Senator Chris Murphy. Ambassador Eric S. Edelman will serve as a discussant and Kim Ghattas will moderate.

# Re-balancing U.S. Security Engagement with Arab States
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [May 26, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4)
*  Good afternoon, good evening from Beirut where I am and welcome to this Carnegie event on [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=30.0s)]
*  rebalancing US security engagement with Arab states. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=40.44s)]
*  I'm Kim Hattas and I'll be your moderator. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=44.92s)]
*  I'm a senior non-resident fellow at Carnegie and a contributing writer at the Atlantic [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  magazine. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  As the Biden administration looks to prioritize the Middle East, what should it prioritize [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=54.52s)]
*  then when it does engage with the region while Russia and China are also vying for influence, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=62.6s)]
*  including military? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=69.72s)]
*  The trend has long been to strip away economic and diplomatic engagement and focus on the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=71.4s)]
*  military and security aspects. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  But is that really in America's interest? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=79.08000000000001s)]
*  And more importantly, is it in the region's interest? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=82.05999999999999s)]
*  We have an excellent panel of speakers, many of who have also written the essays that are [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=84.97999999999999s)]
*  part of the compilation we're presenting today, Michelle Dunn, Fred Weary, Jalal Harshawi [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=90.5s)]
*  and David Schenker. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=95.94s)]
*  And we will get to them in a moment as well as questions from you in the audience. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=97.33999999999999s)]
*  But we start first with a keynote from Senator Chris Murphy, US Senator for Connecticut. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=102.58s)]
*  He is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and he serves as the chairman of [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=110.54s)]
*  the subcommittee on Near East, South Asia, Central Asia and counter terrorism. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=116.54s)]
*  I would like to welcome now with I would like to welcome the senator to to speak, although [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=123.3s)]
*  I see that we're having some technical issues. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=133.1s)]
*  So we're going to move on actually to our panelists. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=136.22s)]
*  We're going to start with Michelle Dunn and Fred Weary, both from Carnegie, who were at [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=139.74s)]
*  the start at the heart of putting this compilation together. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=146.82s)]
*  Let me quickly introduce them. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=150.82s)]
*  Fred Weary is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, where his [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=153.42000000000002s)]
*  research deals with armed conflict and US policy with a focus on Libya, North Africa and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=158.54000000000002s)]
*  the Gulf. Michelle Dunn is the director of the Carnegie's Middle East program, where as [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=163.94s)]
*  a senior fellow, her research focuses on political and economic change in Arab countries as [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=168.94s)]
*  well as US policy in the Middle East. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=174.74s)]
*  And we do hope to bring you Senator Murphy momentarily. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=177.57999999999998s)]
*  But, Fred, let me start with you. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=181.26s)]
*  What was the impetus for this collection of essays? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=183.78s)]
*  What are its key takeaways that set it apart from other commentary that we've seen so [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=187.34s)]
*  often on US security policy? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=192.14s)]
*  Yeah, thanks so much, Kim. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=195.82s)]
*  And I look forward to Senator Murphy's comments as well. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=197.78s)]
*  Michelle and I started this study well before the Biden administration took office and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=202.78s)]
*  announced its desire to shift America's military focus from the Middle East to Asia. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=208.66s)]
*  And even back then, it was clear to both of us that America's security policies in the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=216.06s)]
*  Middle East, specifically toward the Arab world, were really in need of an overhaul. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=222.14s)]
*  That decades of a very securitized engagement in the region, anchored in arms sales and [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=225.94s)]
*  other forms of military to military cooperation, had not really produced desirable results, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=234.42s)]
*  had not lived up to their promise. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=240.85999999999999s)]
*  By any number of metrics, they had not produced regional stability and peace. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=243.1s)]
*  They had not built up the capacities of Arab militaries to the point where they could [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=249.94s)]
*  credibly and independently defend themselves or participate meaningfully in multilateral [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=255.74s)]
*  operations. In fact, they actually enriched elite corruption and patronage, as one of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=260.98s)]
*  our contributors, Jody Vittori, details. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=267.34s)]
*  These arms transfers also did not afford the United States much leverage over partners' [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=271.54s)]
*  behavior, whether domestic behavior or foreign behavior. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=277.42s)]
*  And I think most seriously, this securitized approach over the past couple of years really [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=282.09999999999997s)]
*  enabled and emboldened a number of very disastrous Arab military interventions in proxy [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=287.9s)]
*  wars, of course, Yemen being the most well-known case, but also Libya, where I witnessed [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=294.78s)]
*  firsthand the aftermath of Emirati drone strikes. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=300.18s)]
*  So, you know, as one of our contributors, Robert Springboard, notes, it's quite ironic [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=304.18s)]
*  that these very securitized policies actually made the region less secure. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=309.34s)]
*  But I think most importantly, these policies do not really address the future challenges [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=315.7s)]
*  that the region's citizens face. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=322.82s)]
*  I'm not talking about the regimes, but the citizens. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=325.22s)]
*  And here I'm talking about non-traditional threats, challenges like climate change, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=327.22s)]
*  challenges like the economic fallout from the pandemic, like changing patterns of global [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=332.34s)]
*  oil consumption that really call into question the old ways of ruling. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=338.65999999999997s)]
*  And most importantly, the demands of an increasingly youthful Arab population for better [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=343.17999999999995s)]
*  governance. And those demands, of course, sparked the 2011 Arab Spring. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=349.41999999999996s)]
*  We saw them again in 2019. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=353.29999999999995s)]
*  And as you wrote about, Kim, in your Atlantic article, drawing from a Carnegie workshop, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=355.65999999999997s)]
*  those pressures, those demands have not gone away. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=360.5s)]
*  And so the question for U.S. policy is how do we better address those pressures? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=364.06s)]
*  And what our study argues for is a reduction, a refinement, a rebalancing of the military [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=369.46s)]
*  component of U.S. engagement in the Arab world, to really open up space, open up the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=379.7s)]
*  for non-military tools that we think will be able to better address these looming future [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=385.78000000000003s)]
*  challenges that the region faces. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=392.18s)]
*  Now, what are we talking about in terms of specifics? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=395.06s)]
*  What should actually change? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=397.46000000000004s)]
*  We're not arguing that these states don't have legitimate defense needs or that we shouldn't [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=399.94s)]
*  assist their defense. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=404.82s)]
*  And indeed, is what Omile Hokeyem argues in his piece on the Gulf. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=407.46000000000004s)]
*  We should continue to offer them reassurances, but it's not the blank check reassurances of [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=412.58s)]
*  the past. What we're talking about, what he argues, is a more discreet, tailored, and in [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=418.18s)]
*  some cases conditional form of arms transfers that is really geared toward the threats they [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=423.3s)]
*  face. And he talks about early warning systems, ballistic missile defense, and other forms of [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=428.42s)]
*  defensive technologies. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=433.54s)]
*  Similarly, when we're talking about the U.S. military footprint in the region, we're not [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=435.62s)]
*  arguing for a wholesale withdrawal that would be irresponsible, but rather a reallocation of [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=439.94s)]
*  assets and capabilities to preserve access and overflight to maintain deterrence against Iran [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=446.18s)]
*  and also conduct counterterrorism operations. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=453.7s)]
*  This is what Becca Wasser in her essay calls a rebalancing or rather a right sizing rather than a [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=456.42s)]
*  retrenchment. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=464.34s)]
*  There are a number of other suggestions in the collection to include focusing more on the [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=465.78s)]
*  institutional aspect of defense governance, what the military calls institutional capacity [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=472.09999999999997s)]
*  building, helping these Arab militaries better govern themselves in terms of rule of law. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=478.65999999999997s)]
*  We also explore the notion of a new regional security architecture. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=483.86s)]
*  And as you're about to hear, we think we can implement this rebalancing while at the same time [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=488.34s)]
*  managing competition from Russia and China and also arms competition from our European allies in [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=494.82s)]
*  the region. I'll stop there. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=501.85999999999996s)]
*  I do want to leave time for my colleagues to present and especially to hear comments from [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=504.02s)]
*  David Schenker. David, look forward to your thoughts. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=508.82s)]
*  Back over to you, Kim. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=511.7s)]
*  Fred, thank you very much for bringing us into the core of the subject with this introduction [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=516.34s)]
*  about the compilation, why it was thought through like that, why you decided to have this [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=522.82s)]
*  thinking exercise about US military or rethinking US engagement with the Middle East. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=530.9000000000001s)]
*  And it's a perfect way to introduce Senator Chris Murphy, who is with us now. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=541.3000000000001s)]
*  I believe he's there. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=548.34s)]
*  Yes. Senator Murphy, delighted to have you with us. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=550.34s)]
*  Welcome to this event on rebalancing security engagement with Arab states. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=557.0600000000001s)]
*  You've thought about this issue a lot. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=565.86s)]
*  You've written about it in Foreign Affairs. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=568.02s)]
*  You've called the US approach to the Middle East outdated and dangerous. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=570.26s)]
*  You've heard a little bit of what Fred already had to say, and perhaps you've had the [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=576.26s)]
*  opportunity to read some of these essays in the compilation. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=579.86s)]
*  The floor is yours to give us your keynote and then we'll have a question for you after that. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=584.1s)]
*  And then we'll go back to the panel and the questions from the audience. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=588.74s)]
*  Senator Murphy, the floor is yours. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=592.42s)]
*  Kim, thank you very much and congratulations to Michelle and Fred and all of their [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=594.42s)]
*  co-collaborators on this incredibly important piece. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=600.66s)]
*  I'm going to make sure that this gets read and seen in every corner of the Senate and the House, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=604.1s)]
*  especially amongst those of us who are seeking to desecuritize America's role in the Middle East, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=610.26s)]
*  especially in the Gulf. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=616.4200000000001s)]
*  I think you've brought to light some really important conversations and proposals that [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=617.46s)]
*  will find a lot of favor throughout the building. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=622.34s)]
*  Let me apologize for my technical difficulties. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=624.34s)]
*  For some reason, the Senate computer system does not recognize this particular platform, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=627.5400000000001s)]
*  so I'm coming to you via my iPhone. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=632.74s)]
*  So hopefully the connection will be stable for the time that we're conversing today. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=636.42s)]
*  As you mentioned, I don't hold myself out to be an expert like the authors of this report [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=642.5s)]
*  on the topic at hand, but I did spend a good deal of time late last year and early this [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=650.1800000000001s)]
*  trying to rethink America's role in the Gulf and wrote a rather lengthy piece for foreign affairs, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=657.14s)]
*  which I think dovetails with much of what you've recommended here. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=664.5s)]
*  At the outset of that piece, I make the argument that conditions have substantially changed with [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=669.7800000000001s)]
*  respect to the importance of Gulf states to the United States, and yet it's rather remarkable how [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=676.9s)]
*  little our relationship has changed. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=684.1s)]
*  Maybe most importantly, our reliance on Gulf oil is just not as it was [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=687.94s)]
*  back at the time of the adoption of the Carter Doctrine. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=694.9000000000001s)]
*  We've gone from 29% of the amount of oil we import coming from the Gulf in 1980 to 12% today. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=698.58s)]
*  We're importing more from Mexico right now than we are from Saudi Arabia. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=708.1800000000001s)]
*  Not to say that that economic relationship isn't still important, not to say that the [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=712.82s)]
*  energy relationship isn't important, but it just doesn't exist at the same level. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=717.5400000000001s)]
*  Our dependence isn't the same as it was. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=722.1800000000001s)]
*  But as we also know, our deep alliance with the Gulf states, and in particular Saudi Arabia, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=724.6600000000001s)]
*  was driven by a set of political realities present during the Cold War that are very [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=730.2600000000001s)]
*  different today. It was the marrying together of Arab nationalism and Soviet power that drew [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=738.9s)]
*  us in part to an alliance structure with Gulf states that were more connected to [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=747.54s)]
*  Islam than they were to Arab nationalism. That reality doesn't exist any longer. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=760.1s)]
*  Obviously, we still talk about Russian influence. They still have it in the Gulf, but [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=764.42s)]
*  we are not in the Cold War any longer. It all speaks to a moment of recalibration. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=768.26s)]
*  I think your report comes at just the right time. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=773.4599999999999s)]
*  Emile outlines in his contribution to the report the impact of the effective U.S. security guarantee [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=778.1s)]
*  to the Gulf states with respect to Iran's activity in the region. I will tell you, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=787.4599999999999s)]
*  having just come back, it is remarkable how just a rather minor diminution in the content of that [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=794.42s)]
*  guarantee to the Saudis at the beginning of the Biden administration has had an impact. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=803.2199999999999s)]
*  When I was in Qatar, I heard stories about how immediately after the election, the Saudis were [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=809.14s)]
*  very quick to try to heal the rift in the GCC, knowing that maybe they might be able to rely [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=815.6999999999999s)]
*  on the United States a little bit less to back up all their plays in the region. It was more [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=821.54s)]
*  important to them to get back on the same page with their Gulf allies. Of course, the whole region [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=826.26s)]
*  is abuzz with respect to this set of conversations happening between the Saudis and the Iranians, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=832.74s)]
*  something that would not have happened if we had not telegraphed that we were not going to continue [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=838.9s)]
*  to write a blank check to the Gulf countries on their set of proxy wars around the region. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=845.54s)]
*  So you see all of the grassroots of this new potential regional security architecture that [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=853.9399999999999s)]
*  Fred referenced, and they are just grassroots. They are incredibly fragile, but I do believe [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=859.9399999999999s)]
*  that they are happening because the Biden administration is intent on reconsidering [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=866.9s)]
*  the foundations, the content of the Carter Doctrine in our security relationship. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=874.98s)]
*  Andrew Weiss and Patricia Kim, in this report, talk about this sky will fall argument that many [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=881.9399999999999s)]
*  make about what will happen if the United States draws back and what impact the Chinese and the [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=890.98s)]
*  Russians will have. I think this is a red herring. I call it as such in my piece for foreign affairs. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=897.22s)]
*  I think it misunderstands, A, the willingness of the Chinese to get their hands dirty and [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=904.58s)]
*  regional security matters in the Middle East, and B, misunderstands what the relationship of [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=910.1s)]
*  these oil producing states in the Gulf will be with Russia moving forward as oil revenues decline. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=916.1s)]
*  The Gulf and Moscow are going to be competitors for a decreasing oil market around the world, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=924.5s)]
*  which is going to frankly make it a little bit harder for them to have a more integrated [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=932.58s)]
*  security relationship. All of this is also underlined by the fact that the United States [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=938.34s)]
*  still has weapons systems that are irreplaceable. And I think we can call the bluff of some of our [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=945.7s)]
*  partners there because in the end, they do not want to be fully reliant on non-American systems. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=951.38s)]
*  And then Becca Wasser in this report, I'm very glad, talks about this outdated archipelago of [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=960.74s)]
*  military bases that we have in the region. And I make the argument in my piece a little bit [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=969.46s)]
*  heretical in the United States Senate that we think about closing some of those bases, that we [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=975.38s)]
*  confront the fact that we were able to protect our interests in the Middle East prior to [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=982.1s)]
*  September 11th without the massive basing footprint that we have today. And that basing [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=986.74s)]
*  footprint ends up giving legitimacy to brutal regimes, regimes that are getting even more brutal [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=994.5s)]
*  in their conduct to repress political speech and freedom like Bahrain. It provides bullets and [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1001.7s)]
*  board recruiting material for the organizations that we're fighting against. These bases are [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1007.94s)]
*  costly and they just draw attention away from other focuses that should be at the center of [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1014.5s)]
*  American foreign policy outside of the Middle East. I just got off the phone this morning with a [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1021.62s)]
*  group of Yemeni scholars and boy, they were quick to remind me that it is the perception of the US [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1028.5s)]
*  that is often our most important leverage in the region and our military activities in the [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1036.98s)]
*  regions, they told me this morning, decrease our leverage. They were maybe most specifically [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1042.02s)]
*  talking about our drone campaigns in Yemen that continue to this day and how that makes us in some [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1047.22s)]
*  ways of illegitimate interlocking between different rival factions, warring factions inside [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1054.74s)]
*  Yemen. Another reminder of how important it is to desecuritize our footprint. So I make the argument [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1065.22s)]
*  in that piece that there's really nowhere else in the world in which US policy has remained so static [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1072.5s)]
*  as the conditions on the ground and the consequences for US security have changed [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1082.8200000000002s)]
*  so significantly over the course of the last several decades. And this report, I think as I [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1090.5800000000002s)]
*  said before, comes at the perfect time. I will, as I said, do everything possible to make sure [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1097.7s)]
*  that my colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee and the Appropriations Committee [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1104.74s)]
*  see it and I'm so grateful to all of the work that was put into it. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1108.18s)]
*  Senator, thank you very much for your comments and it's also great to see that you read the report [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1113.78s)]
*  so closely in all the essays. Two quick questions for you. You say that you want to make sure that [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1119.22s)]
*  all your colleagues see this report and hopefully the White House will see it as well, but as the [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1126.66s)]
*  Biden administration states that it wants to de-prioritize the region, do you think that what [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1132.42s)]
*  they might do in fact is limit themselves just to the basics of military and security engagement? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1138.8200000000002s)]
*  Or do you think it is possible to see them prioritize political and economic engagement [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1145.38s)]
*  and civil rights, which is what we're seeing across the region, a call for civil rights from Iraq to [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1151.38s)]
*  Lebanon with protesters who are saying we want a nation, we don't just want to be seen as a [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1156.66s)]
*  security issue? I don't think it is possible to effectively pivot in that way with the current [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1162.34s)]
*  resource structure available to the U.S. president and that is why Chris Van Holland and some partners [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1174.02s)]
*  in the House have proposed and myself put on the table a detailed plan to increase the capacity of [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1181.6999999999998s)]
*  the State Department and USAID by 20% in the next year. I'm glad frankly that the administration [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1188.98s)]
*  has proposed in their introductory budget a 10% increase. I hear what you're saying. I think that [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1194.34s)]
*  that is a legitimate risk because the Department of Defense will just simply have presence that [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1202.74s)]
*  isn't going to disappear, have the resources in order to continue to maintain those primary [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1209.38s)]
*  relationships and if we continue to starve state and USAID, they won't have the ability to [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1215.54s)]
*  pick up the pieces. So I think this is the moment to talk about some much bigger resources [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1223.3s)]
*  to the bureaus so that we can do the hard work that's necessary. Let's take a place like Lebanon. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1230.8999999999999s)]
*  Our most significant relationship in Lebanon remains the military-to-military relationship. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1237.46s)]
*  Why? Because that's where all the money is. I have always supported military assistance to [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1241.86s)]
*  the Lebanese army. I think they're a force for good but the Lebanese army is not going to fix [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1248.1s)]
*  Lebanon's problems. Lebanon's a pyramid scheme that needs intense diplomatic and economic diplomacy [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1252.1s)]
*  in order to both put together the support necessary for them to make economic reform [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1258.34s)]
*  but also provide the political council necessary to convince leaders there to take a different path. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1264.5s)]
*  The US military can't do that but we don't have the diplomatic staff, the diplomatic oxygen in [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1271.86s)]
*  order to surge in Lebanon in coordination with the French and others to convince them to make [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1279.4599999999998s)]
*  reforms necessary and to give them a little bit of leverage to make it happen. So I think your [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1286.5s)]
*  caution is rightly made and I think the way in which we guard against the withdrawal being [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1291.2199999999998s)]
*  political and diplomatic and not military is to give the political people and diplomats more [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1299.86s)]
*  resources. Thank you Senator Murphy. One last question for you. I know we have you only for a [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1306.5s)]
*  short time. One of the essays in the compilation addresses the issue of the defense industry and [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1313.22s)]
*  the jobs that it has that it produces in the US. Your state, Connecticut, has a large number of [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1318.5s)]
*  these defense jobs. How do you balance your foreign policy concerns with the need to avoid losing [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1324.9s)]
*  some of those jobs for your constituents? Yeah listen I just draw a red line and I make that [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1331.0600000000002s)]
*  very clear to my constituents. I am never ever going to support military jobs in Connecticut [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1338.66s)]
*  if those jobs hurt US national security and yes some of the technology involved in these smart [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1346.1000000000001s)]
*  bombs are made in Connecticut but when these bombs are being dropped on civilians inside Yemen and [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1354.18s)]
*  they are being used to help fuel the radicalization of Yemenis and drive them to groups that want to [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1361.3s)]
*  plan attacks against the US those jobs are not worth it. Neither are jobs that are connected to [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1367.46s)]
*  human rights abuses overseas. I find that when I sort of say that out loud in Connecticut it draws [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1374.8200000000002s)]
*  no issue. I think there's nobody in Connecticut says nope. I like the jobs notwithstanding the [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1382.02s)]
*  fact that there are weapons are being used to kill you know kids on school buses overseas. So I don't [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1388.42s)]
*  necessarily know that there's a big choice to be made. I do think in general the impact of the [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1395.3s)]
*  military industrial complex is real and absolutely drives US policy which is why I'm so excited about [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1400.02s)]
*  some of the conversations we're having right now. I mean in the Senate today we're talking about a [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1406.98s)]
*  new industrial policy in which we are going to use government resources to build a chip industry [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1411.22s)]
*  in the United States. We are going to next move to a bill that's going to talk about using US [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1418.1000000000001s)]
*  resources to build an electric vehicle industry and a wind solar technology industry in the United [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1423.22s)]
*  States. We use billions of taxpayer dollars to build a military industry here which I would argue [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1430.18s)]
*  does some good and some harm but if we build a chip industry here and we build a renewable energy [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1437.7800000000002s)]
*  industry in the United States that will be all good no harm and it will serve to relieve a little [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1445.38s)]
*  bit of the pressure on members of Congress who right now can only build jobs with US dollars [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1451.94s)]
*  by supporting money to the Department of Defense. Now obviously there are dollars for other projects [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1459.46s)]
*  outside of the Defense Department but that's the biggest bulk so if you create some other big [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1463.3s)]
*  accounts in chips in renewable energy it'll allow other members to make decisions like I do [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1467.54s)]
*  to only be for jobs in their state if the products we're producing actually [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1474.5s)]
*  end up being used in the national security interests of the US. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1480.6599999999999s)]
*  Senator Murphy thank you very much for being with us I know you have to go but thank you very much [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1484.8999999999999s)]
*  for being with us for this part of the event and I hope to see you in Beirut again sometime soon. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1489.22s)]
*  Thank you very much. So grateful for your work thanks for including me. Thank you. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1494.18s)]
*  Now we'll go back to our panelists and authors we've already heard from Fred Weary. I've already [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1498.9s)]
*  introduced Michelle Dunn but let me just introduce our other two speakers as well. Jalal Hershawi is [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1506.42s)]
*  a senior fellow at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime where his work [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1513.86s)]
*  focuses on security landscape and the political economy in North Africa. We also have with us [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1519.54s)]
*  David Schenker he's a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1524.8999999999999s)]
*  where his research focuses on the military and political affairs of Syria, Lebanon, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1530.18s)]
*  Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian territories and we will have time for questions. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1534.82s)]
*  If you have questions already use the live chat feature in the YouTube page or tweet [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1541.0600000000002s)]
*  at us at Carnegie Endow using the hashtag ask Carnegie. Michelle I'm going to turn it over to [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1546.98s)]
*  you with a question you just heard the senator there talk about this delicate re- [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1552.8200000000002s)]
*  balancing that you have to do. We don't want to end up with just sort of you know if the [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1558.0600000000002s)]
*  if the Biden administration is de-prioritizing the police that we end up only with military and [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1563.46s)]
*  security engagement at the same time this rebalancing is occurring while China and Russia [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1568.74s)]
*  are increasing their involvement in the region. How do we make sure that the U.S. doesn't lose out [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1576.1s)]
*  or make it too easy for Russia and China and frankly for Iran as well? Thank you Kim and I [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1583.38s)]
*  want to add my thanks for to Senator Murphy for being with us today. He's from my home state of [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1590.82s)]
*  Connecticut and we're always really grateful for all his engagement on foreign policy and specifically [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1599.3s)]
*  the Middle East region. So you know Kim look I the way I see it the United States has gotten [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1606.82s)]
*  locked into legacy military assistance relationships in the Middle East. Those are [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1613.54s)]
*  primarily with Israel Egypt and Jordan as well as engaged in heavy competition with its European [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1619.7s)]
*  allies for defense sales to the Gulf States and of course big big defense relationships with the [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1626.5800000000002s)]
*  Gulf States. Meanwhile Russia and China who are less tied down in this region by these sort of [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1633.7s)]
*  legacy relationships they've been more able to adapt to a rapidly changing Middle East. Now I'm [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1642.42s)]
*  not saying I approve of what they've done but merely that they can adapt to serve their own [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1649.22s)]
*  interests I think more more capably than the United States can. There's an essay by Andrew Weiss [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1654.5s)]
*  in this compilation and you know he discusses how Russia is primarily engaged militarily in an [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1662.1000000000001s)]
*  opportunistic way establishing presences in Syria and Libya picking up sales to defense sales to U.S. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1669.06s)]
*  allies and then we have an essay by Patricia Kim about China which is selling some arms primarily [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1677.7s)]
*  drones but mainly focusing on economic engagement. It really a quest for economic rather than military [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1684.26s)]
*  domination in this region particularly in tech and infrastructure. So you know I don't think I [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1690.9s)]
*  really I don't really agree with the perspective that Arab states have turned to Russia or China [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1698.98s)]
*  for defense relationships because the United States has somehow disappointed them. I think [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1704.66s)]
*  this is just a reality of what the multi-polar world means that Arab states see buying from the [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1711.3000000000002s)]
*  United States and its major regional rivals as both and not either or that they're they are [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1719.5400000000002s)]
*  doing both of these things and they're they're realistically they're going to continue to do [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1726.9s)]
*  both of them and it does present the United States with some difficult dilemmas particularly [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1731.3s)]
*  regarding technology transfer and I hope we'll have a chance to talk about that more. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1736.4199999999998s)]
*  But just to return to the sort of the picture of U.S. rivalry with Russia and China in the region [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1741.54s)]
*  if you read those essays by Andrew and Patricia I think they point out that the United States [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1749.7s)]
*  still has plenty of opportunities to outmaneuver an under-resourced Russia as well as a China that's [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1754.82s)]
*  you know primarily still engaged elsewhere in the world but the United States needs to become more [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1763.62s)]
*  nimble in its policy. So as we know the United States it's not going to do more in this region. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1769.3799999999999s)]
*  I think the question is deciding you know as we say what is the balance you know what is what are [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1775.54s)]
*  the most meaningful and constructive ways for the United States to be engaged in the Middle East and [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1781.78s)]
*  with Arab states. You know this region is at the beginning of a major economic transformation from [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1788.98s)]
*  depending on oil and gas revenues it's going to have to change over the next 10 years you know a [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1796.42s)]
*  little more maybe toward productive economies which is something most of the states don't have [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1804.8999999999999s)]
*  and they're going to have to be built probably primarily on human capital on technology and they [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1810.26s)]
*  have major climate change challenges which Fred mentioned water security food security. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1817.14s)]
*  So here's a question does the United States really want China to be the major partner of this region [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1825.3s)]
*  in economic transformation while the United States remains the major partner in for regional wars. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1833.3s)]
*  Is that what we want? I think we you know we've gotten off balance here you know and we're [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1841.78s)]
*  ending up you know contributing to wars contributing to human rights abuses fueling regional arms races [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1847.8600000000001s)]
*  fueling overspending on defense in many of these countries and so forth. So I do think a rebalancing [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1855.7s)]
*  or rethinking is way overdue the current strategy is it's expensive and it's ineffective and it [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1865.46s)]
*  doesn't allow the United States to be doing some of the good things it could be doing to help this [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1874.26s)]
*  region move beyond conflict and toward as I said productive economies and you know and they will [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1880.8999999999999s)]
*  need eventually you know governance structures that can support productive economies. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1889.3s)]
*  Thank you very much Michelle and as you say you know does the U.S. want to be the main military [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1896.74s)]
*  partner of this region while China invests in the economy but also what contrasts the U.S. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1903.86s)]
*  versus China and Russia is its ability despite its faults to promote democracy to promote human [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1910.18s)]
*  rights and as we've seen in the interim national strategic guidance of the Biden administration [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1919.22s)]
*  all the talk about fighting corruption upholding rule of law and governance which is if you want [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1927.8600000000001s)]
*  long-term stability in the region is the way to go but this is a great segue to ask a question [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1933.14s)]
*  to Jalal because you know Michelle talks about how you know does the U.S. want to be the main [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1939.94s)]
*  military partner while other countries are offering something more productive if we want to you know [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1945.6200000000001s)]
*  summarize it like that but countries in the region have have agency Saudi Arabia the UAE Bahrain Qatar [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1950.66s)]
*  they have their own interests that may run counter to this effort at downsizing the security aspect [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1958.18s)]
*  of the relationship how does the Biden administration take that into account and how does it handle [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1965.22s)]
*  a competition from others to arm the region including the Europeans? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1972.58s)]
*  Well thank you Kim being part of this panel is a terrific honor thank you you know I've tried to [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1978.1000000000001s)]
*  think a lot about this this question the difference between typically the rhetoric that the Gulf states [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1985.54s)]
*  use when they are shopping for for weapons in Washington and their true preoccupations usually [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1991.86s)]
*  they insist a lot they place a lot of the emphasis on Iran fear of Iran and counterterrorism [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=1999.62s)]
*  but there's another slightly different category of concerns that they usually do not share with [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2006.58s)]
*  with the politicians in DC when it and it's those concerns that have to do with politics [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2014.66s)]
*  with ideology and they have nothing to do with with Iran and they're not really technically [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2022.18s)]
*  about terrorism it's about a certain form of politics that I would define like populistic [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2028.66s)]
*  uh bottom-up electoral Islamist politics and and those currents that exist throughout the the [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2037.46s)]
*  Middle East and North Africa region the Gulf states respond to very differently depending on [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2045.3799999999999s)]
*  which one you look you look at and as a result of course you have this temptation to be to be [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2051.94s)]
*  able to buy some weapons and and and use force to address what is fundamentally a political concern [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2057.7s)]
*  and um and and of course when you when you go to war because you have an ideological concern about [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2065.2999999999997s)]
*  about maybe you know too much initiative being shown by by citizens in some some remote ab-suni [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2071.9399999999996s)]
*  country then then of course the the risk of of utilizing those weapons and ending up [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2078.74s)]
*  violating human rights uh conventions and other and other aspects you know too many casualties [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2084.8999999999996s)]
*  amongst civilians then you then of course uh the you know you realize that that kind of activity [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2090.9s)]
*  is effectively what has been seen as a niche not just by the two great uh anti-liberal powers [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2098.1800000000003s)]
*  China and Russia which have been mentioned a few times since the beginning of this discussion [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2107.14s)]
*  but also the Europeans the the number one set of weapons in that category would be would be France [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2111.94s)]
*  and and if you look at the way uh end user agreements are enforced by by Washington and [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2119.22s)]
*  the way France effectively manages the same the same facets you have a a gulf a huge difference [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2125.4599999999996s)]
*  in terms of attitude and so this is basically uh one way of of understanding uh the the competition [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2133.7s)]
*  that does exist uh between between Europe and and the U.S. and it doesn't mean at all [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2142.74s)]
*  that the U.S. is not unique of course it has been said a few times since the beginning of this [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2148.5s)]
*  conversation the U.S. is still absolutely unique is still powerful enough to be in a replaceable [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2153.7799999999997s)]
*  friend to the gulf states and and as a result those additional or alternative providers of weapons [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2160.1s)]
*  like China Russia but also unfortunately the Europeans are seen as of course a source of [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2166.74s)]
*  extra safety but also they're they're attractive because of the leeway that they offer and uh and [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2172.4199999999996s)]
*  in our paper what we do basically is is insist on on on how irreplaceable uh the U.S. is and and how [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2179.06s)]
*  well it manages the end user agreements for example to to to mention this technical aspect [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2187.7s)]
*  and and it's still time to be able to promote a tighter alignment in terms of of how weapons are [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2192.74s)]
*  used by U.S. partners in the gulf and it could be promoted diplomatically or it could be imposed [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2199.9399999999996s)]
*  through regulation there are a lot of tools there's plenty of time but i just wanted to kind of you [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2206.2599999999998s)]
*  know distinguish those two kinds of use you have the official narrative about how bad Iran is and [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2212.02s)]
*  in fact Iran is if you look at the pecking order of threats perceived it's not always the number [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2220.58s)]
*  one whatever happens within the sunni universe sometimes is the is the number one concern of [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2227.06s)]
*  gulf states thank you very much um and if indeed this uh this rivalry or this this imbalance in [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2233.62s)]
*  in the arab world between soj Arabia and the sunni camp and Iran that keeps bringing the U.S. further [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2242.98s)]
*  back into um into military engagement with with the region and that's what we we want to try to [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2249.78s)]
*  step away from and i'm going to go to um to david now um you were the most recent uh um you know [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2256.02s)]
*  you were still you were recently still on the inside of an administration dealing with some [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2263.5400000000004s)]
*  of these uh of these issues uh related to um to defense sales um i mean what do you make of this [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2269.46s)]
*  of this approach to rethinking military engagement or how to rebalance engagement with the region [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2277.54s)]
*  and to some extent deprioritize the military aspect of the security aspect [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2285.22s)]
*  is there an imbalance um and is it realistic to do what senator murphy suggested that you up the [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2290.9s)]
*  political and diplomatic engagement as you um look at how you rebalance the the military engagement [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2298.98s)]
*  well thanks kim and uh thanks uh fred and michelle for inviting me to be here um listen i i do believe [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2307.86s)]
*  that um we haven't taken a real look at um what we're doing on security assistance whether it's [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2316.66s)]
*  effective um and the balance of our approach and and that in that regard i think you know it's a [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2324.18s)]
*  thought-provoking piece of work um that carnegie has put out here and um and worth [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2331.7s)]
*  worth a read i disagree um with uh senator murphy's uh proposition um that you know we are so [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2338.98s)]
*  over militarized that we're not doing we need the diplomatic surge that we're you know need to do [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2350.02s)]
*  more by 20 percent of the humanitarian front um listen i think um i think we have a robust [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2355.86s)]
*  diplomatic approach in the region um i i thought well maybe this is all self-serving here but [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2363.06s)]
*  i was pretty active in the state part was pretty active when i was working over in the new years [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2369.6200000000003s)]
*  affairs bureau um you know we were engaged and um and talking to our friends and partners and [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2374.7400000000002s)]
*  otherwise i also think in terms of humanitarian that we do more than anybody else in the whole [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2382.2599999999998s)]
*  world um and i think it's important to take a look at what that is accomplished as well [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2386.74s)]
*  um in some cases in the region where we do more humanitarian work we are hated more right to the [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2392.5s)]
*  the the view of the united states and and uh and the perspective on what we're doing um it's not [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2399.38s)]
*  improved by the great humanitarian work that we do um so i think this is not a panacea um to give [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2406.42s)]
*  more money necessarily um to surge humanitarian um i i think we have to we have to think about [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2415.38s)]
*  where we're putting our resources and where they're not having an impact um sometimes we [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2422.9s)]
*  do it out of altruism um in terms of humanitarian but sometimes we have to you know recalibrate and [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2428.1s)]
*  put it somewhere else we're going to get a bigger a bigger bounce um and it's not just uh the amount [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2434.34s)]
*  of dollars um we have to take credit for it too because this is about promoting our interests at [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2440.7400000000002s)]
*  the end of the day right and so you could say that maybe our interest will be promoted by doing a [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2446.7400000000002s)]
*  western basing strategy by pulling up and going from hot to warm bases i agree with all of that [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2451.7000000000003s)]
*  and i think um it's smart to think about what our posture is what we're spending money on um [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2458.6600000000003s)]
*  but there's no single you know allocation here um that is going to get us to where we want to go [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2464.5800000000004s)]
*  necessarily um let me just have a very quick follow-up uh from you uh with you david and then [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2470.6600000000003s)]
*  i'll um go to questions from from the audience and maybe i'll i will ask one more question of fred [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2478.6600000000003s)]
*  because we heard from him at the very beginning so we want to hear from him again before we go to [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2484.9s)]
*  questions maybe um and just a reminder if you want to submit a question for the event use the [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2488.98s)]
*  youtube chat or tweet us at carnegie and dow using the hashtag as carnegie um david isn't it true [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2493.22s)]
*  though that these military relationships that the u.s has with countries in the region be it egypt [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2499.4599999999996s)]
*  be it sojibia be it bahrain be it qatar um help to perpetuate a system um that does not allow [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2507.14s)]
*  political maturation societies and democracy to be the outcome of a natural progression [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2517.22s)]
*  it upholds a military system it upholds repressive systems and so don't you agree that [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2524.58s)]
*  there should be a rebalancing and how or reframing at least and how the u.s sees the region shouldn't [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2531.62s)]
*  look beyond its military to military relationships and see the people of this region and what they [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2537.94s)]
*  are calling for yes and yes and no and no i don't think that it necessarily underpins all these [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2543.46s)]
*  dictatorial regimes there i think um if i think if the united states said tomorrow that we will [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2554.18s)]
*  stop selling weapons to the government of egypt the repressive government of egypt will go out [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2559.14s)]
*  and buy more weapons from france russia china and it will still be repressive and we have spent [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2564.1s)]
*  tens and hundreds of millions of dollars on democracy promotion there and work with civil [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2571.46s)]
*  societies um all throughout the region and we've gotten very little uh very little traction um so [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2576.26s)]
*  listen i believe in it i believe that we should promote our values um and that um support um what [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2584.18s)]
*  the people want in the region and they have uh legitimate rights and rights against their [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2591.3s)]
*  government and we should back that with u.s efforts uh diplomatic um usaid et cetera um [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2595.86s)]
*  but let's not blame the united states for the region's oppressive governments all right um [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2604.6600000000003s)]
*  we haven't maybe at times done enough to call them out um and we should do more um and we should [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2612.02s)]
*  be i think true to our values at the same time um we cannot change every government in the middle [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2619.06s)]
*  east um we we can't do it by military force as i think springboard points out in his paper that [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2625.06s)]
*  we're you know we can't um we have very little ability to impact the trajectories of domestic [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2632.34s)]
*  politics in these countries we can stand up for what we believe um but uh we're not going to go [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2638.2599999999998s)]
*  out either topple these governments or um do what the iranians say is what uh the velvet revolutions [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2644.9s)]
*  um you know i i think um you know um there are limited things that we can do [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2651.62s)]
*  um we are not all powerful the united states [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2658.9s)]
*  david i'm going to start taking questions from from the audience we have one question about [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2665.54s)]
*  the covet pandemic and whether that's an opportunity to begin this process of moving away from security [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2670.66s)]
*  and look at more at health and the economic real as arab states are grappling with under investment [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2677.94s)]
*  in in the health system uh fred why don't you take that question and and expand a little bit on the [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2684.1s)]
*  ways that the u.s can um engage differently uh with the region and is the covet pandemic one of them [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2689.78s)]
*  yeah thanks and um and david thank you for your comments as a as a practitioner you know points [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2700.02s)]
*  well taken about you know giving agency to regionals and and also you know that we're not the sole [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2704.98s)]
*  source of repression in the region um you know just following on that i i do think there is [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2710.98s)]
*  an opportunity with this with this pandemic or this post-pandemic world to to re-engage [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2716.34s)]
*  you know societies and and echoing senator murphy's point that you know it's really the [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2721.14s)]
*  perception that matters the u.s has so much you know influence on um the soft power front front [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2725.86s)]
*  and you know we shouldn't be going head to toe with these peer competitors like china and russia [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2732.66s)]
*  in the arms sales game but you know rather play to our strengths and i think uh usaid administrator [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2736.8999999999996s)]
*  samantha power was absolutely right that you know we can use um the um vaccine diplomacy you know to [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2742.18s)]
*  our advantage that this is an opening you know to show the world that there is an alternative to the [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2748.66s)]
*  china you know china model um just just some you know broader comments and following up on david [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2754.58s)]
*  david's comments you know i um i served as a u.s military attaché in a number of arab countries and [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2760.82s)]
*  i do think there's a preference in these countries for defense diplomacy they they like dealing [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2766.34s)]
*  with the defense department we have this entire architecture of security assistance you know that [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2770.9s)]
*  that hasn't given space to other you know forms of assistance other tools and i think what we're [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2776.1800000000003s)]
*  arguing is reducing that component i think will naturally you know open up space is it a panacea [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2781.2200000000003s)]
*  no you're absolutely right david but i think it's worth um worth considering worth pursuing [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2786.66s)]
*  thank you um fred we have a comment on this as well of course you mind my my jumping in [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2794.58s)]
*  you know um you know david i think you know you certainly are right that the united states [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2801.8599999999997s)]
*  um cannot and should not go around toppling regimes in the middle east that's that's not even [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2808.02s)]
*  on the table at all i don't think um but i'm you know i i'm gonna differ with you a little bit i [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2813.78s)]
*  think in terms of u.s responsibility because you know as jalal indicated one of the reasons that [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2821.5400000000004s)]
*  uh arab governments buy a lot of weapons buy a huge amount of weapons right the you know i i think [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2829.6200000000003s)]
*  it's about half of the top 20 arms purchasers in the world are uh middle eastern countries three [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2836.34s)]
*  out of the top four they're clearly buying you know far beyond what they need for defense and [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2843.38s)]
*  there are domestic political reasons for that uh some of them are just sort of um you know a show [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2850.82s)]
*  of uh a show of strength and a show of international support i think clearly for example [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2858.42s)]
*  in egypt president cc does this these you know whether whether it's arms assistance or whether [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2865.1400000000003s)]
*  it's arms purchases he uses it to show that those come those countries that either gave him in the [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2871.38s)]
*  case of the united states or sold him in the case of france russia etc that they support him and [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2878.58s)]
*  furthermore that they support military rule in egypt it's clearly and then the other aspect is [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2884.34s)]
*  what jody vittori brings out in her essay how these extensive arms purchases by arab countries [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2891.06s)]
*  are used to fuel um patronage you know networks within the countries and so forth so while i quite [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2899.54s)]
*  agree it's it's not up to the united states at all to wave a wand and change things in countries in [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2908.66s)]
*  the middle east i still think it isn't right that we just close our eyes to what the political [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2916.02s)]
*  ramifications are inside these countries of what we're doing and um you know i think that kim rightly [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2921.86s)]
*  points out that we really face a dilemma in in many perhaps most of the arab countries there's [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2928.82s)]
*  a huge gap between governments and citizens in terms of their priorities certainly in terms of [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2935.38s)]
*  their spending priorities uh and many other ways as well and it puts the united states you know [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2942.26s)]
*  in a a difficult situation you know i've often heard it said by u.s officials well why do we [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2949.3s)]
*  sell you know all these arms to you know arab governments well that's what they want that's [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2956.2599999999998s)]
*  what they ask us for but that's what you know that that's what a lot of the top officials in [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2961.14s)]
*  the governments want for the reasons i've just mentioned they're not necessarily what the [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2966.98s)]
*  citizens want or what the citizens need and so you know it is difficult for the united states as an [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2971.7799999999997s)]
*  outsider um you know but but we're still responsible for our own actions and as i said [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2978.98s)]
*  at the beginning we need to figure out what do we think is the constructive and appropriate role [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2985.38s)]
*  for the united states to play in this region understanding that we're outsiders and we don't [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2991.46s)]
*  control outcomes there thank you michelle there's a comment from the audience from mohammed moha who [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=2997.54s)]
*  says bringing assistance to a country is not about how much you spend but how much impact [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3006.58s)]
*  this would bring the u.s should focus on governance and strengthening institutions uh with more [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3011.06s)]
*  economic reforms and i want to use that to ask jalal a question um you know corruption is a big [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3017.46s)]
*  issue um in the region i know we're speaking about how to you know lessen uh military and security [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3024.02s)]
*  aspects corruption can be related to the military can be related to military spending to patronage [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3029.94s)]
*  to security but you know can the u.s um you know by promoting a drive against corruption by upholding [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3036.42s)]
*  rule of law and governance and really you know highlight these issues is that one entry point [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3044.9s)]
*  into this rebalancing yeah absolutely i mean there are two ways of approaching this this important [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3051.38s)]
*  issue i thank you for bringing it up you have of course a lot of people who think that even this [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3063.22s)]
*  could be militarized you know they look for um pockets of law and order in a given country and [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3069.2999999999997s)]
*  they pick a faction in the case of a civil war and they use the anti-corruption argument to [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3076.3399999999997s)]
*  increase military support or or armed support for a particular faction thinking that it's they're [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3084.2599999999998s)]
*  basically looking for a policeman to go out after after another corrupt uh faction but in reality the [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3090.74s)]
*  the design of the financial institutions uh has tremendous import import here um just by um the in [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3099.7s)]
*  terms of bank for your buck you can have a huge effect on the amount of corruption simply by [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3108.18s)]
*  tweaking uh the uh the principal financial pillars of a given country and here uh the u.s is uh is in [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3114.66s)]
*  a very privileged position because first of all it has all the expertise all the know-how of the [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3123.7799999999997s)]
*  experience plus it controls the dollars the dollar which is the the central currency when you when [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3130.3399999999997s)]
*  you sell oil so if you view it as an institutional exercise and and you basically try to [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3136.9s)]
*  increase checks and balances decentralize in a genuine fashion some of the financial plumbing [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3145.54s)]
*  you can achieve a lot in terms of transparency in terms of you know all kinds of mechanisms that [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3152.1800000000003s)]
*  could actually limit the amount of corruption and it has nothing to do very very often with a [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3159.62s)]
*  armed force or might versus might kind of issue uh and and i think and i think of course i mean [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3166.18s)]
*  the u.s has been doing this but it could be doing it even more and the europeans usually neglect [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3173.54s)]
*  this realm and they should also help in the same direction and you could have tremendous results [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3179.3s)]
*  when it comes to the combat against corruption absolutely um fred i want to turn back to you and [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3184.1s)]
*  ask you when you look at the region and you you know you posit this idea of rebalancing [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3191.78s)]
*  and and re-engaging differently uh with the region and de-emphasizing uh the military aspect or at [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3199.38s)]
*  least um rethinking uh the framework where would you advise the biden administration to start [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3206.02s)]
*  at the very heart of it sojibia qatar the whole posture towards iran or on the periphery [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3214.42s)]
*  with countries like lebanon for example as center murphy was was saying [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3221.46s)]
*  i would start in the in the gulf because of their you know their outsized impact on [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3228.42s)]
*  on the region what we've seen you know their their interventions that we've already um you [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3232.98s)]
*  know talked about and i think obviously given the the um you know their their control of oil [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3237.86s)]
*  resources uh the proximity to iran and you know and i do think you know echoing delisle's comments [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3243.78s)]
*  i think we need to to really peel back the layers of their you know threat perception what they're [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3250.2599999999998s)]
*  telling us versus what they really are afraid of and and as he alluded to they're you know over [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3255.62s)]
*  the next decade i believe they're going to be facing um stresses on their rule right and we're [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3262.3399999999997s)]
*  not talking about the collapse of the monarchies but you know i do think they're facing these [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3268.1s)]
*  stresses and a lot of times they they code those fears as islamism populism you know electoral [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3272.74s)]
*  democracy and so what what's the antidote to those fears it's it's addressing those [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3278.98s)]
*  the needs of their citizens right structural reforms building up human capital you know and [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3284.34s)]
*  they do have legitimate you know discrete defense needs in terms of ballistic missile defense and [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3290.34s)]
*  as amil talks about we need to help them there so again you know focusing on the gulf because the [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3295.7s)]
*  gulf have they've used these very sophisticated weapons outside their territories they have the [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3300.5s)]
*  capacity now to operate you know well beyond their territories i do think we should we should [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3305.54s)]
*  focus on that that's not to say we should neglect you know other countries as you mentioned lebanon [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3310.74s)]
*  is an important case lebanese armed forces an important partner i've worked a lot on tunisia [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3314.9s)]
*  the tunisian military relatively hopeful case aligning them with that country's um you know [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3319.7s)]
*  democratic transition they do have counterterrorism needs and we've been helping them there [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3325.22s)]
*  um i want to ask a couple more questions to david and then we're going to probably close with um [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3329.94s)]
*  michelle um david as you listen to your colleagues and you've read the essays you know what do you [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3336.82s)]
*  think iran is thinking um at the moment if it hears you know um about a biden administration [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3344.5s)]
*  that wants to de-emphasize um the military aspect of the relationship with with the reach of the [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3351.46s)]
*  aspect of the relationship with with the region [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3357.46s)]
*  and how would you address that because the problem has often been that as fred said you know [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3363.46s)]
*  arab allies um you know make it sound like they're about to be thrown thrown over or that iran is [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3370.02s)]
*  about to take over and in some ways one could argue that that it has become very powerful in [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3376.82s)]
*  the region but they do exaggerate the threat sometimes as well so how do you balance that and [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3380.9s)]
*  how do you explain to your allies why this approach is is needed well listen a number of [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3386.26s)]
*  the papers whether it was amiels or becca's been a very fine paper um you know it talked about the [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3395.38s)]
*  need to reassure um our allies you know that is we'd say fred that it's uh not a retrenchment it's [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3401.86s)]
*  uh it's um what you say is not retrenchment it's uh [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3409.06s)]
*  yeah anyway so um so it's a real refocus or um uh i think it's very hard um to reassure them [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3416.98s)]
*  um we tried um we tried before we tried during the trump administration um you know uh [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3429.22s)]
*  i think iran looks at this and says oh there's no um the united states isn't going to be in [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3437.14s)]
*  peace ab anymore they're going to have fewer troops in the in the region um boy we were doing [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3443.22s)]
*  all this with the houthis against saudi radian before we the houthis actually even control pieces [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3449.46s)]
*  of saudi territory think about how much more we can get it's not only that we're going to take [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3455.54s)]
*  and then control the whole country we're gonna we're gonna actually blackmail saudi [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3460.98s)]
*  rabia to letting in however many hundreds of thousands of of yemenese a year to work in saudi [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3465.3s)]
*  rabia etc or get um no i i think they're that iran looks at this and says america's overextended [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3471.06s)]
*  uh they're leaving this is very good for us um and listen i take what uh what amiels argument [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3478.5s)]
*  about giving them better missile defense and uh and giving these people specialized give [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3485.94s)]
*  our allies specialized equipment um we know um that uh they cannot defend themselves um [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3491.06s)]
*  nobody thinks they can defend themselves um they rely on american security umbrella now we may be [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3502.18s)]
*  able to provide them with that umbrella from over the horizon it may actually even be safer for them [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3510.34s)]
*  and for us to be based in in diego garcia jordan and europe and and elsewhere further away i get it [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3517.1400000000003s)]
*  um but we're gonna have to and i think becca had some useful useful you know points in her paper [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3526.1000000000004s)]
*  about how we go about flying the flag in the region being present without being permanently [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3532.34s)]
*  present in large numbers um but i i think it's gonna be really hard to convince our our partners [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3539.06s)]
*  that we are still with them and i think we're gonna see hedging i think that people are gonna [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3546.2599999999998s)]
*  reach out even more to try and explore types of security relationships um with the chinese [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3551.2999999999997s)]
*  closer type of of uh relationships with uh problematic partners um for us i want to give [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3558.42s)]
*  michelle uh the last word 30 seconds uh to wrap us up michelle and perhaps uh counter uh david's [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3567.22s)]
*  argument that our allies will hedge is there a way to make to reassure them without pushing them [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3574.9s)]
*  towards this this hedging that could be detrimental to the region as well [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3581.06s)]
*  well look i think the really difficult decisions that face the biden administration right now [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3585.2999999999997s)]
*  are related to um you know whether or not to transfer more and more advanced weapons to this [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3591.06s)]
*  region for example this massive sale to the uae of f-35s and advanced drones you know that's one [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3597.54s)]
*  argument how the united states can reduce its security presence just transfer you know very [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3604.42s)]
*  advanced arms you know to our allies and they'll be able to defend themselves past history suggests [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3610.8199999999997s)]
*  that is not going to work very well and it's just going to you know fuel an arms race in the region [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3617.7799999999997s)]
*  and so forth so you know what where things really need to go i mean robert springboard talks in his [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3624.4199999999996s)]
*  essay about returning to the idea of regional security architecture um you know this is [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3630.5s)]
*  something i think that we really should be engaging uh u.s allies in europe uh as well as the chinese [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3635.8599999999997s)]
*  and russians and so forth you know as to whether there could be a security architecture in the [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3644.5s)]
*  region instead of you know simply continuing this process of arming all the various parties to the [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3650.66s)]
*  teeth and letting them fight it out which is to no one's good michelle michelle don thank you very [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrsWO0Egv4&t=3657.7s)]
