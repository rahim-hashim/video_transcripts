# What Happens to Palestine if the Arabs Go to Peaces?
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [December 16, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA)
*  So [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=30.0s)]
*  good morning and welcome to this panel discussion on what happens to Palestine if the Arabs [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=58.56s)]
*  go to pieces. This panel is organized by the Malcolm H. Kerr Carnegie Middle East Center [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=63.84s)]
*  as part of its fourth annual conference titled a global renewal what to expect in 2021. My [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=69.4s)]
*  name is Laura Friedman and I'm the president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace. I [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=75.88s)]
*  am thrilled to be the moderator of what promises to be an interesting and very timely discussion [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=79.44s)]
*  I'm going to introduce four speakers who I will introduce briefly here in alphabetical order. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=86.3s)]
*  First we have Zaha Hassan a human rights lawyer and visiting fellow at the Carnegie Endowment. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=90.3s)]
*  We have ambassador Marwan Mouashar who is the vice president for studies at the Carnegie [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=96.3s)]
*  Endowment and served as the first Jordanian ambassador to Israel. We have Christian Oryxson [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=101.3s)]
*  a Middle East fellow at the Baker Institute. And last we have ambassador Jake Wallace a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=106.3s)]
*  nonresident senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment and former US chief of mission and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=111.3s)]
*  consul general to Jerusalem. As laid out in the video you just saw the context for this panel [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=115.3s)]
*  is the spate of recent agreements between Israel and various Arab states. Some people call them [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=121.3s)]
*  peace deals despite the fact that there was no actual conflict between the parties that the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=126.3s)]
*  deals resolved. Others have called them normalization deals which better reflects what has happened [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=130.3s)]
*  to a great extent a coming out of the closet and deepening of ties that had already existed. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=135.3s)]
*  Others have focused on the overtly transactional elements of these agreements whether arms sales [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=140.3s)]
*  or removal of Sudan from the state sponsors of terrorism list or in Morocco US recognizing [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=145.3s)]
*  sovereignty over the western Sahara. And in each of these deals while the Arab side has given lip [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=151.3s)]
*  service to continued support for Palestinian rights the substance and implications of these [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=157.3s)]
*  agreements suggest that concern for the Palestinians is not the only factor or even a key factor of [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=162.3s)]
*  these Arab states. And here actually I just want to get right to it. We have a great panel. We have [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=168.3s)]
*  a lot of questions. So I'm going to be asking a series of questions to the panel. You are welcome. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=174.3s)]
*  We encourage people to offer their own questions. I will be watching the questions as they come up [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=180.3s)]
*  and bringing as many of them as I can into the discussion. So I first want to start just sort of [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=185.3s)]
*  setting the scene. I want to start with Ambassador Mouashar. So Ambassador Mouashar, four Arab [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=192.3s)]
*  countries UAE, Morocco have now signed or expressed effect on the future of peace and is the Arab [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=197.3s)]
*  peace initiative. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=209.3s)]
*  Thank you, Lara. It's great to be with you. Yes, you are right. These four bilateral [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=212.3s)]
*  agreements are bilateral agreements or transactional agreements having to do with other [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=218.3s)]
*  interests than the peace process. One cannot call them peace agreements for the reasons that you [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=223.3s)]
*  outlined. That does not mean they do not have an effect on peace. They do have an effect on [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=228.3s)]
*  peace. In fact, a negative one. So far Arab countries have not been able to make peace [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=234.3s)]
*  agreements. They have not been able to make peace agreements. They have not been able to make [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=240.3s)]
*  peace agreements. So far Arab countries have promised in a consensus way is there a full [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=245.3s)]
*  normalization, full peace relationships and full security arrangements in return for full [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=251.3s)]
*  withdrawal from occupied territories, whether they're Palestinian, Syrian or Lebanese. These [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=257.3s)]
*  are agreements that have undermined this land for peace principle in exchange for peace for [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=263.3s)]
*  peace, meaning that they are giving Israel the false impression that they don't have to come to [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=269.3s)]
*  terms with the Palestinians with which they are living, of course, if they can sign peace [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=275.3s)]
*  agreements with the outer Arab world. And so to the outside world, these look like peace [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=281.3s)]
*  agreements. These look like the country is the region is coming to peace with itself. In fact, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=287.3s)]
*  they make the cause of peace so much farther because of the fact they don't insist on land for [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=293.3s)]
*  peace. And so you ask me if the Arab peace initiative is dead. Unfortunately, and I say [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=299.3s)]
*  unfortunately, as somebody who was deeply involved in the development of the Arab peace initiative, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=305.3s)]
*  which was based on land for peace and based on consensus, every single country in the world, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=311.3s)]
*  signed on to that. Now with four Arab countries having abandoned basically this principle, I'm [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=317.3s)]
*  afraid it's going to take a miracle to revive this initiative. Thank you. And Zaha, I want to pick up [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=323.3s)]
*  on that. So these four Arab countries are not the first to normalize relations with Israel. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=329.3s)]
*  Can you talk about the relationship between the two countries? I mean, the two Arab countries [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=335.3s)]
*  are not the first to normalize relations with Israel. Can you talk about how these [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=341.3s)]
*  normalization agreements compare to the Jordan Israel and Egypt Israel peace treaties? And how are [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=347.3s)]
*  the context and the implications, both similar or different? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=353.3s)]
*  And Zaha, you're muted. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=359.3s)]
*  I will never learn. Thanks, Laura. And thanks to the Malcolm Curse Center for inviting me today. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=365.3s)]
*  Before I get into what is similar or what is different about the Arab Israeli peace agreements of the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=371.3s)]
*  past and the more recent normalization deals of the present, I want to first dispel the notion that [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=377.3s)]
*  active U.S. engagement and deal making to encourage Arab Israeli normalization is a novelty of the Trump [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=383.3s)]
*  administration and specific to its efforts to compel Palestinians to acquiesce to the administration's [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=389.3s)]
*  peace to prosperity plan. In fact, successive U.S. administrations have looked for creative ways to [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=395.3s)]
*  break Arab resolve and the taboo around normalizing relations with Israel before a comprehensive [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=401.3s)]
*  peace with Palestinians assigned. For sure, U.S. grants of security assistance to Egypt were an important part of the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=407.3s)]
*  peace agreement President Carter brokered with Israel. But even Palestinians have been called upon to [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=413.3s)]
*  support Arab normalization as a part of President Clinton's proclamation to extend duty-free treatment [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=419.3s)]
*  to products of the West Bank and Gaza, a measure to increase bilateral trade between Palestinians and the [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=425.3s)]
*  U.S. PILO Chairman Yasser Arafat had to promise to work toward the end of the Arab League boycott of Israel. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=431.3s)]
*  Similarly, as a part of the Bahrain-U.S. free trade agreement in 2005, Bahrain had to cancel its participation in the Arab League boycott. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=437.3s)]
*  But what was different about the Trump administration's approach to normalization was the lengths it was willing to go to [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=443.3s)]
*  and how it boasted about and marketed the deals in a way to induce other states to fall in line. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=449.3s)]
*  So back to your question on the similarities and differences of the past peace agreements and today's [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=455.3s)]
*  peace or deals to normalize relations with Israel. They can be distinguished in two important ways. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=461.3s)]
*  In my view, first by the nature of the agreements and what was the thing being normalized. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=467.3s)]
*  And second, whether the agreement sought to preserve or undermine Palestinian rights and claims. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=473.3s)]
*  Past peace agreements were just that as Ambassador Mouashad noted. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=479.3s)]
*  They were peace agreements. They aimed to end a state of war that existed between a particular Arab country and Israel. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=485.3s)]
*  From an Israeli perspective, normalization of relations meant Egypt and Jordan had accepted the legitimacy of the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=491.3s)]
*  existence of the state of Israel within the 1949 armistice lines as a neighbor. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=497.3s)]
*  What was being prioritized was security for both sides. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=503.3s)]
*  In addition to the Egyptian framework agreement and the Jordanian peace agreement, both included provisions that [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=507.3s)]
*  attempted to preserve and acknowledge Palestinian rights and territorial claims. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=513.3s)]
*  The deals of today are not about ending states of belligerency since none of the four Arab countries, the UAE, Bahrain, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=517.3s)]
*  Sudan, and Morocco, were ever at war with Israel. The deals are not primarily about normalizing the existence of the state [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=523.3s)]
*  of Israel since three of the four countries already had really good relations with the state of Israel, albeit under the table. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=529.3s)]
*  The new deals are meant to cut a path open for Arab normalization of Israeli settlements and Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=535.3s)]
*  including Jerusalem. It's instructive to look at the UAE-Israel normalization deal. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=541.3s)]
*  The tripartite statement signed at the White House references Israel's decision to suspend annexation of the West Bank. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=547.3s)]
*  The tripartite statement signed at the White House references Israel's decision to suspend annexation, but it did not make suspension a condition precedent for normalization. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=553.3s)]
*  The actual treaty between the UAE and Israel references support for Palestinian-Israeli peace and the tripartite statement signed at the White House. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=563.3s)]
*  But those are in the preambular inoperative clauses. The operative language of the treaty does not require Israel to halt annexation, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=573.3s)]
*  nor does it provide for the preservation or protection of Palestinian rights and claims. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=581.3s)]
*  Rather, it prioritizes regional integration of Israel through various bilateral agreements to be concluded later. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=585.3s)]
*  Some of the more telling agreements or activities that we've seen coming out of the gate from the UAE were agreements with Israeli settler companies in the West Bank to purchase olive oil and other products of the West Bank to UAE companies. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=593.3s)]
*  This deal was actually facilitated by a settler regional council in Hebron before the signing of the Abraham Accords, but was made public later. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=608.3s)]
*  There's a UAE trade deal that allows wine from Israeli settlements in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights to be imported to the UAE. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=617.3s)]
*  Settler regional councils' heads have traveled to the UAE in the first business delegations to the Emirates. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=624.3s)]
*  There's a proposed joint Israeli UAE development project in East Jerusalem to promote tourism and to develop the tech sector. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=631.3s)]
*  Now, this project would involve the eviction and demolition of Palestinian businesses in Wadi Joas, a neighborhood of occupied East Jerusalem, something Israel has been after for some time. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=638.3s)]
*  And there's an Emirati billionaire who's now become part owner of a soccer team located in Jerusalem. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=649.3s)]
*  And Israel and the UAE have also established the Abraham Fund, which envisions the United States, Israel, and the UAE mobilizing $3 billion of private sector-led funding toward joint ventures and regional economic cooperation. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=656.3s)]
*  The fund mirrors the Peace to Prosperity Plan's economic component, but the difference is that the Abraham Fund does not mention Palestinians, nor does it reference Palestinian state-building efforts. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=670.3s)]
*  So it remains to be seen whether the bilateral agreement's flowing from normalization, and will the other Arab states will follow suit with the UAE normalization deal. We'll just have to wait and see. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=682.3s)]
*  Thank you. And I think it's worth noting, if you follow the sort of greater Israel advocates out there, I'm thinking of Professor Eugene Kontorovich, for example, they're already framing the Morocco deal and the recognition of Moroccan sovereignty in the Western Sahara as a precedent for normalizing Israel's annexation of the West Bank. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=695.3s)]
*  So the implications there are pretty clear as well. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=717.3s)]
*  Jake, I want to turn to you. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=720.3s)]
*  You know, we are on the cusp of a change of leadership in the United States. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=722.3s)]
*  How do you think a Biden administration will or should approach normalization between Israel and the Arab states? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=727.3s)]
*  Thank you, Laura, and thank you to Carnegie for hosting this today. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=738.3s)]
*  As Zaha just pointed out, the United States has long supported normalization between Israel and the Arab states, not just the front-line states, Jordan and Egypt, but more broadly throughout the region. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=743.3s)]
*  In the 90s, during the height of the Oslo period, there was actually some significant progress made in that area. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=756.3s)]
*  There were a number of Arab states, Morocco, Tunisia, Oman and Qatar, that established low-level relations with Israel and they exchanged diplomatic offices, not full relations. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=763.3s)]
*  There were steps. Those steps basically were reversed during the second Intifada. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=775.3s)]
*  But in terms of U.S. policy, it's long been something that we've supported. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=781.3s)]
*  And I think that President Biden, when he's inaugurated in January, and his team will want to continue this as well, they will support normalization. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=786.3s)]
*  However, I think they will differ in how they approach it. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=795.3s)]
*  As others have pointed out, Trump's deals were very transactional. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=799.3s)]
*  In fact, the normalization deals we've seen recently are basically three-way deals where the United States will provide some benefit of a bilateral nature to the Arab country. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=803.3s)]
*  The Arab country in return would recognize Israel and Israel would then enjoy the benefits of that. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=814.3s)]
*  In the case of the Emirates, the U.S. provided the F-35s and the other military weapons systems that they wanted and had not been achieved for a long period of time. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=821.3s)]
*  In the case of Morocco, it was recognition of the Western Sahara. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=833.3s)]
*  And in the case of Sudan, it was removal from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=836.3s)]
*  I don't think President Biden will continue to pursue this normalization in a similar way. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=841.3s)]
*  I think future deals will have to stand on their own merits. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=848.3s)]
*  In other words, there will have to be two-way deals between Israel and the Arab state. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=851.3s)]
*  And the benefits they send and receive will have to stand on their own. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=856.3s)]
*  And there will not be inducements coming from the United States. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=861.3s)]
*  I don't think there will be the same kind of linkage as there was under Trump and the Palestinian issue as well. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=866.3s)]
*  In the case of Trump, it was more of a negative linkage that deals were designed, I think, in a way to prevent Palestinians from achieving their aspirations. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=872.3s)]
*  I don't think a Biden administration will explicitly link normalization to progress on the Palestinian track. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=881.3s)]
*  I think it will be more of a neutral approach. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=889.3s)]
*  In other words, as I said, those deals would have to stand on their own. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=891.3s)]
*  I suspect that we will see more of these deals in the future under a Biden administration, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=895.3s)]
*  although what I would call the low-hanging fruit has already been taken care of. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=901.3s)]
*  You've already seen a number of countries normalize. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=907.3s)]
*  The only one that I'd say is likely in the near term to follow suit would be Oman. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=909.3s)]
*  And that may happen either under a Trump administration or a Biden administration. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=916.3s)]
*  So I think normalization will continue, but the approach will be different under Joe Biden. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=921.3s)]
*  Thanks. And it's been striking watching some of the commentary around these deals, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=928.3s)]
*  particularly those poking fun at former Secretary of State John Kerry, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=933.3s)]
*  who had said that these deals could not come before a deal with the Palestinians. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=938.3s)]
*  And it's really, as an analyst, it's striking to see how much of this is a really, it's a paradigm shift. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=943.3s)]
*  It's not that John Kerry was wrong. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=948.3s)]
*  It's that he was talking about a completely different policy regime, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=950.3s)]
*  one which isn't so transactional, which sort of everything isn't on the table in order to achieve things. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=954.3s)]
*  It'll be interesting to see under Biden where that goes. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=959.3s)]
*  Christian, I want to turn to you. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=962.3s)]
*  Why do you think the UAE and Bahrain chose this moment to normalize relations with Israel? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=965.3s)]
*  Were there reasons different in each case? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=972.3s)]
*  And how much of this is sort of Trump specific or other regional factors that stay in play? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=974.3s)]
*  Well, thank you again for the invitation to be on this panel very timely. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=980.3s)]
*  I would argue a lot of it is Trump specific. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=984.3s)]
*  I think for the UAE in particular, the increasingly open relationship the UAE had with Israel [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=987.3s)]
*  was something that Emirati officials wanted to bring out into the open and to formalize, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=995.3s)]
*  especially if it did mean they could present themselves as having taken annexation off the table [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1001.3s)]
*  no matter what the reality may be, in fact. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1006.3s)]
*  And I think from an Emirati perspective, it was a very clever move to try and reset the conversation in Washington, D.C., [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1010.3s)]
*  away from issues like Yemen war and human rights issues. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1017.3s)]
*  And to cast the UAE as a sort of bringer of peace, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1022.3s)]
*  which has been a very strong message ever since the Abraham Accords were announced. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1026.3s)]
*  I think from an Emirati perspective, it gave Trump a win in the Middle East, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1031.3s)]
*  assuming he would win re-election, it kind of reset the narrative there. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1036.3s)]
*  But it also tried to really position the UAE as something different in the Gulf or in the Middle East more generally, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1041.3s)]
*  a kind of force for good. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1047.3s)]
*  And in a way, try to distance the UAE from the close association it had with Saudi Arabia over the last four years [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1049.3s)]
*  when people have spoken with Mohammed bin Salman and Mohammed bin Zayed as if they were one and the same in regional politics. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1057.3s)]
*  It was a very strategic move. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1063.3s)]
*  And there's also the strategic agenda for the Middle East, which is partly Abraham Accords with the UAE, not with Bahrain. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1066.3s)]
*  And we've seen some of the manifestations of that with visits of Saudi Arabia, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1072.3s)]
*  with the kind of close coordination between the UAE and Israel on security issues since August as well. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1079.3s)]
*  So I do think also the shock of the U.S. not necessarily responding openly to the attacks in 2019 in the Gulf [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1086.3s)]
*  shows that the UAE is also beginning to think about a post-American region in a sense, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1094.3s)]
*  if the U.S. can no longer be taken for granted as a sort of regional guarantor of security, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1099.3s)]
*  they'll have to make new strategic alignments. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1104.3s)]
*  For Bahrain, I think the Bahrainis had always wanted to normalize. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1107.3s)]
*  We've had senior Bahraini figures in 2017, 2018 saying we'll be the first, we'll be in two years, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1110.3s)]
*  so they got the timeline right. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1116.3s)]
*  They just didn't get that they would be first. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1118.3s)]
*  I think they have been much more cautious. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1121.3s)]
*  I think they have to be cautious just because they have a more vocal domestic constituency. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1123.3s)]
*  But again, from Bahrain's point of view, there's long been a desire to follow suit. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1128.3s)]
*  And so I think also we've noticed that Bahrain seems to have gotten less out of this transactional kind of deal making [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1132.3s)]
*  than the other states, no kind of occupation of Western Sahara, no sort of F-35, no taking off the terrorism list. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1139.3s)]
*  So I think Bahrain was more about following on and sort of trying to put into place a longer term aspiration [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1146.3s)]
*  to also make Bahrain look like it's a model of religious tolerance, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1154.3s)]
*  which then deflects away from the problems they've had over the last 10 years post 2011 [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1157.3s)]
*  with their own Shia community majority in Bahrain itself. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1163.3s)]
*  Again, changes that conversation. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1168.3s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1170.3s)]
*  And I want to stick with you, Christian, for a minute to follow up on something that Jake had said. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1173.3s)]
*  How do you think the Biden administration will approach the issue of normalization in the Gulf? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1178.3s)]
*  And do you foresee other Gulf states following suit either before they come on board or after? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1183.3s)]
*  And I also want to ask you if you want to comment about the dynamics with Qatar, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1189.3s)]
*  which is in the news today because of some lawsuits that were just filed against various banks [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1193.3s)]
*  and institutions linked to the Qatar leadership, terrorism lawsuits in the U.S. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1200.3s)]
*  If you can sort of tie that all together. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1206.3s)]
*  Yeah, I think as Jake said, the Biden administration will continue to support the idea of normalization. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1209.3s)]
*  I think in the Gulf, Oman will be one to watch. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1216.3s)]
*  I don't think the Omanis will necessarily move to normalize [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1219.3s)]
*  because the Omanis have always tried to balance relationships between different states in the region. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1223.3s)]
*  And we've seen very clearly how they often have a statement that they've spoken to an Israeli leader [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1228.3s)]
*  and then immediately afterwards spoken to a Palestinian as well. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1233.3s)]
*  They tried to balance, not necessarily to take sides. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1236.3s)]
*  And I think once the strong transactional pressure from the Trump administration is taken away, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1239.3s)]
*  we might seem just more the same balancing. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1246.3s)]
*  I think Kuwait won't normalize just because Kuwait is still our generational leadership. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1248.3s)]
*  It has lived every stage of the Arab-Israeli conflict. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1254.3s)]
*  And Kuwait also has a democratic sort of trappings of a parliament which injects populism into Kuwaiti politics, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1258.3s)]
*  which means that no leadership would necessarily feel secure of domestic support, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1265.3s)]
*  which of course then leaves Qatar, as you've mentioned. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1270.3s)]
*  And Qatar and Israel have worked closely on Gaza, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1273.3s)]
*  worked closely on trying to channel financial and humanitarian support. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1277.3s)]
*  And again, I don't see Qatar normalizing. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1281.3s)]
*  I think the Qataris and Israelis have a relationship that works perfectly well as it is, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1284.3s)]
*  albeit that, as you've mentioned, there were lawsuits and indications that at least actors maybe around the region [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1289.3s)]
*  are trying to sort of use Qatar's involvement in Gaza against the Qataris in the past [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1296.3s)]
*  and to sort of try to score political points within the wider framework of the geopolitical rift [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1303.3s)]
*  we've seen engulf politics over the past three and a half years. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1309.3s)]
*  Thank you. It's something for all of us to watch. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1315.3s)]
*  Marwan, I want to sort of shift focus to the Palestinians here, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1318.3s)]
*  which is obviously part of the whole discussion, but very clearly the Arab-Israeli conflict, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1322.3s)]
*  do you believe this is going to be a priority, first of all, for the Biden administration? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1327.3s)]
*  And assuming that it's not, and I think most people believe it won't be, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1331.3s)]
*  what does that mean for the Palestinians, given that the Arab world seems to have lost interest in the issue? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1335.3s)]
*  Are the Palestinians on their own? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1342.3s)]
*  I do agree, Lara, that the Biden administration will not regard the Arab-Israeli conflict as a high priority, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1348.3s)]
*  not because President-elect Biden is not interested in achieving a peace agreement, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1355.3s)]
*  but because he understands very well the difficulty of getting to an agreement [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1360.3s)]
*  at a time when he is preoccupied with the domestic scene in the US, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1366.3s)]
*  trying to repair the rift inside the United States, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1371.3s)]
*  trying to regain the relationship with the European Union, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1376.3s)]
*  trying to deal with China in a different way. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1379.3s)]
*  So the Arab-Israeli conflict is not going to be of any high priority. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1381.3s)]
*  I want to remind us all of what John Kerry said under a Biden, under an Obama-Biden administration in 2014 [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1385.3s)]
*  when he addressed Congress and said, you know, we have one year, 18 months max before the window closes on a two-state solution. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1393.3s)]
*  And of course, it's been six years since the last serious effort by John Kerry to revive the peace process. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1402.3s)]
*  Biden understands that very well. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1409.3s)]
*  He's not going to spend his time working on an issue that he knows is going to be very difficult, if not impossible, to resolve. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1411.3s)]
*  So the Palestinians are largely on their own. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1422.3s)]
*  They will get some help from countries who are genuinely interested in a peace agreement like Jordan, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1424.3s)]
*  because Jordan does not want the solution to come at its own expense. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1430.3s)]
*  And so there are a few countries in the Arab world that genuinely want a peace agreement and will support the Palestinians. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1435.3s)]
*  But will they have a critical mass that will support the Palestinians at a time when the international community, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1443.3s)]
*  not just the Arab world, has also seemed to have lost interest in the negotiations? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1450.3s)]
*  I think that the Palestinians are on their own. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1457.3s)]
*  That's not necessarily bad. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1461.3s)]
*  We can talk about this maybe later in the program. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1463.3s)]
*  This is not necessarily bad. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1467.3s)]
*  The Arab world tried through the Arab peace initiative to offer Israel a solution that goes beyond the Palestinians [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1469.3s)]
*  so that it assures the Israelis that they will have security and peace collectively by the whole Arab world in return for withdrawal from occupation. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1478.3s)]
*  Today, it is very clear that the Israelis have no intention to end the occupation, have no intention to establish a Palestinian state. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1488.3s)]
*  And therefore, the whole idea of enlarging the conflict to include the whole Arab world has just crumbled. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1496.3s)]
*  And the conflict is going back to its basic roots, a Palestinian-Israeli conflict. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1503.3s)]
*  Thanks. And that's a great segue for what I want to ask Zaha. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1509.3s)]
*  So Zaha, in terms of impact on Palestinians on the ground, how might normalization under Biden, if it continues, differ from what we've seen under Trump? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1514.3s)]
*  And I want to pull in a question that's come in from the audience. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1524.3s)]
*  It's a great one, which is the question of whether or not there is any idea or possibility for leveraging the Israeli-Arab normalization, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1527.3s)]
*  such as it has been already, to advance Israeli-Palestinian peace. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1536.3s)]
*  And other people can also take this up. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1540.3s)]
*  I think it's one of the key questions a lot of us are grappling with. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1542.3s)]
*  So as I said earlier, for Israel, normalization of Arab-Israeli relations in 2020 was about normalizing Israeli control over the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1545.3s)]
*  Under the Trump Peace to Prosperity Plan, again, regional economic integration was to be the vehicle for cementing Israeli annexation into the fabric of the Middle East. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1559.3s)]
*  The Trump plan envisioned at least 30% of the West Bank coming under Israeli sovereignty. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1571.3s)]
*  So regional integration would have involved that territory, which would prevent any viable sovereign Palestinian state from emerging in the future. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1575.3s)]
*  That means Palestinians would have had to permanently live in the isolated enclaves they currently exist on under a separate legal regime that denies them fundamental rights and freedoms. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1583.3s)]
*  And no people has been willing to give up their freedom willingly. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1593.3s)]
*  So we would have expected if Trump had been re-elected that this would have caused a lot of instability, to say the least, on the ground with Palestinians. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1597.3s)]
*  Now, what will normalization of Arab-Israeli relations look like under a Biden administration? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1607.3s)]
*  I mean, we know that the Biden campaign promised to urge Arab states to take bold actions towards normalization. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1613.3s)]
*  How bold is bold? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1620.3s)]
*  I don't think, as was said earlier, that we're going to see future normalization agreements that involve US commitments to sell sophisticated weapons to Arab states, as we saw with the UAE-Israeli normalization deal. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1622.3s)]
*  I think the incoming Biden administration should start by sending a clear signal of where it stands on the matter. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1634.3s)]
*  It can do this by reversing some of the Trump administration's overreach to legitimate Israeli settlement in the West Bank. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1641.3s)]
*  This could include reversing things like the extension of the US-Israeli bilateral cooperation agreements into the occupied West Bank, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1647.3s)]
*  the new State Department policy of labeling settlement products made in Israel and dropping the use of the word occupation in government reports, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1654.3s)]
*  and referring to Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem as Arabs rather than by their national identity. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1662.3s)]
*  Most important, Biden, a president like Biden, should disavow the Trump plan with respect to Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem, even if the embassy is not relocated back to Tel Aviv. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1668.3s)]
*  Taking these kinds of actions would reset the US posture toward Palestine-Israel peace. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1680.3s)]
*  It would encourage Arab governments that have already normalized to self-correct, and it sends an important message to those states thinking about normalizing moving forward. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1685.3s)]
*  It would also send an encouraging signal to Palestinians who the Biden administration will want to work toward restoring relations with. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1694.3s)]
*  How the agreements can be leveraged moving forward is by doing exactly these things, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1702.3s)]
*  by encouraging any agreements that come following normalization to conform to international law, to conform to third state responsibilities towards occupied territories. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1710.3s)]
*  And so this could be something that the US administration could discuss with Arab governments who, of course, are heavily influenced by US advice in this matter. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1726.3s)]
*  So taking those kinds of steps, if there is to be Arab normalization agreements in the future, would be a very helpful way to have those go forward, but also complying with international law at the same time. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1742.3s)]
*  Thanks, Saha. That's a perfect lead-in to what I want to ask Jake. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1758.3s)]
*  Jake, you have obviously long experience within successive US administrations. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1764.3s)]
*  Do you think the Biden administration will try to, as Saha said, reset or, as some people are saying, restore the US relationship with the Palestinians, whether we're talking about aid or diplomatic ties, the consulate, the PLO mission in Washington? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1770.3s)]
*  And do you think they should make this a priority? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1783.3s)]
*  And assuming that they do try to do this, do you think they can succeed and that it could make a difference? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1786.3s)]
*  I do think that the Biden administration will want to try to find a way to restore the relationship with Palestinians, but it's not going to be easy. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1793.3s)]
*  The Trump administration did a lot of damage to that relationship, and it will not, as I said, it will not be easy for Biden to undo all of that. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1807.3s)]
*  Certainly not very quickly. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1816.3s)]
*  There are three main issues, as you pointed out, Laura. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1819.3s)]
*  There's the assistance that the US provided to the Palestinians, both to the Palestinian Authority directly and also to private Palestinian organizations. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1821.3s)]
*  There's the PLO office that used to operate in Washington, and there was the US consulate in Jerusalem, which in the past was our diplomatic representation to the Palestinians. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1830.3s)]
*  In the case of the first two, the US and the PLO mission, those issues are both constrained by US legislation, which has restricted our ability to do those things. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1841.3s)]
*  And that will constrain the ability of the administration to reverse the steps that the Trump administration took. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1855.3s)]
*  The linkage in the legislation is two main issues. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1863.3s)]
*  First of all, the so-called payments to martyrs by the Palestinian Authority, and secondly, by Palestinian membership in international organizations. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1865.3s)]
*  And Laura, I think you know this issue better than anyone. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1874.3s)]
*  These laws are very complicated. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1877.3s)]
*  In some cases, there are waivers that the administration can use, but that's not the case on everything. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1880.3s)]
*  So in order for the administration to succeed in reversing these Trump policies, there's going to have to be some modification by the Palestinians in their approach to these two issues. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1888.3s)]
*  I know that on the issue of martyrs payments, there's already a debate going on within the Palestinian Authority about how to do that, but they haven't made any steps yet. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1901.3s)]
*  So it will require steps both by the administration and also on the Palestinian side as well. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1911.3s)]
*  In terms of the consulate, the administration has a little bit more flexibility because it's within the purview of the executive branch to determine how the United States maintains its diplomatic representation overseas. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1917.3s)]
*  But here the issue of geography is a little bit complicated. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1931.3s)]
*  The previous consulate had offices in West Jerusalem and East Jerusalem and operated for many years as the U.S. Representative, not just to the Palestinian Authority, but within Jerusalem and to the West Bank and to Gaza. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1935.3s)]
*  One option the administration would have would be to simply go back to the way things were before. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1949.3s)]
*  That's complicated by the fact that we now have an embassy in Jerusalem representing the United States to Israel, and sorting that out will be a little bit tricky. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1956.3s)]
*  If it's not restored exactly the way it was, there's been talk about putting an office in East Jerusalem. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1965.3s)]
*  The complication about that is that there's no existing facility in East Jerusalem that the United States could move into very quickly. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1971.3s)]
*  And there's not a lot of open space in East Jerusalem where you could build a new building, which in any case would take a long period of time. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1979.3s)]
*  Putting a representative office in Ramallah is another option. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1987.3s)]
*  But I think the optics of that would look like the U.S. is no longer looking at any Palestinian connection to East Jerusalem, which is something that would not go over well. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=1991.3s)]
*  So it's a tricky space in which to operate and exactly how the administration will approach it is not clear at this point. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2004.3s)]
*  But in terms of the larger point, I do think they will try to restore the relationship with Palestinians. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2010.3s)]
*  And it bears a lot of watching because none of this would be very easy. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2016.3s)]
*  Yeah, and one thing that I would add that strikes me, and you and I both served in Jerusalem, when people talk about reopening something in East Jerusalem, they don't really understand what that means, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2023.3s)]
*  because there was never a U.S. mission to East Jerusalem. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2033.3s)]
*  And when they talk about opening some sort of mission to the Palestinians, they seem to forget about settlements. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2036.3s)]
*  Because from my perspective as an observer, settlements remain something that is dealt with by the embassy. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2040.3s)]
*  It's in effect validating the Trump approach of treating the West Bank as Israeli territory. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2046.3s)]
*  It sends a very problematic message that a new mission would not be territorially focused, but would just be treating the Palestinians as almost a local issue. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2052.3s)]
*  But that's the sort of thing I obsess about. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2061.3s)]
*  Jake, I want to continue with you. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2064.3s)]
*  And I actually, I mean, I want you to talk about, again, a little bit from your perspective as being inside of various administrations on whether you think this will be even on the list of priorities for the Biden administration coming in. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2066.3s)]
*  And I also want you to take on the question we talked about earlier, whether or not you see, if you were the assistant secretary today, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2077.3s)]
*  do you see a way forward where the normalization that has already taken place could somehow be leveraged, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2086.3s)]
*  even if it was never intended to be leveraged for making Israeli-Palestinian peace? [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2093.3s)]
*  Could it be repurposed for that use? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2097.3s)]
*  Well, in terms of the big picture, I would agree with what Marwan said earlier, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2102.3s)]
*  that this whole set of issues is not a priority for the administration. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2107.3s)]
*  They will have primarily domestic concerns in the beginning. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2111.3s)]
*  When they turn to foreign policy, they'll be looking to restore our relationships with Europe and deal with the challenges in Asia, including with China. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2115.3s)]
*  I think the specific subset of issues in terms of restoring the relationship with the Palestinians will get some priority because they will see that as a necessary step in order to have any influence in the future on the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2124.3s)]
*  which they will want to do. They will want, at some point, to take on a role on this issue. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2140.3s)]
*  And they can't do that without having some relationship already established with the Palestinians. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2146.3s)]
*  In terms of leverage, it's a complicated question. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2151.3s)]
*  I've always been of the view that the issue of normalization was not any real leverage with Israel to begin with. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2156.3s)]
*  What I mean by that is, in the Arab Peace Initiative, the idea was that normalization will be withheld until there was an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2165.3s)]
*  That was a way of putting leverage on Israel to do a deal with the Palestinians. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2175.3s)]
*  The reality is, I don't think over the course of less than several decades, the lack of normalization produced any particular leverage with Israel. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2180.3s)]
*  Israel never modified its position vis-a-vis the Palestinians in any significant way because of this issue of normalization. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2191.3s)]
*  I think the idea now is to reverse that. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2199.3s)]
*  The idea of the proponents of normalization now is that by offering normalization upfront, that will give some leverage against Israel to prevent them from taking negative steps vis-a-vis the Palestinians. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2202.3s)]
*  And the obvious example there is on the issue of annexation, which is an element of the deal between Israel and the Emirates. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2214.3s)]
*  It wasn't explicitly in the agreement, but the whole idea of normalization going through with the Emirates was conditioned on Israel giving up on annexation. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2224.3s)]
*  The idea now is that if Israel would proceed on annexation, they would lose the benefit of the normalization with the Emirates. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2233.3s)]
*  I think that's true to an extent, but it's hard to expand that much farther. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2242.3s)]
*  I'm not sure that Israel is going to be constrained very much in terms of dealing with the Palestinians by the existing normalization or the prospect of getting additional normalization. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2247.3s)]
*  So there may be some linkage possible, but I don't think it's going to be a big determining factor in how Israel approaches the Palestinians. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2259.3s)]
*  I think there are many other issues that are more important there. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2267.3s)]
*  Thanks. And I think it's also worth reminding people that the term used in the deal with the UAE was suspending, not ending the idea of annexation. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2272.3s)]
*  It was suspending it. So that was used over and over. That word was doing a lot of work in that agreement. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2282.3s)]
*  You mentioned the Arab Peace Initiative. Christian, I want to come back to you on that. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2288.3s)]
*  We haven't talked much about the Saudis, who of course are the big prize and have not yet normalized. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2292.3s)]
*  Are the Saudis really still wedded to the Arab Peace Initiative? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2296.3s)]
*  And what do you see the way forward being on Israel-Saudi relations? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2299.3s)]
*  Well, I do think there is a generational issue here. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2308.3s)]
*  King Salman is a longstanding supporter of Palestinian causes. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2312.3s)]
*  As governor, we add as a high profile prince within the family. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2318.3s)]
*  He was for decades one of the fundraisers, the humanitarians who would channel support to the families of Palestinians, including martyrs who were lost in the fight against the Israeli occupation. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2322.3s)]
*  So I think as long as King Salman is still with us and is still also fully in charge and he turns 85 at the end of this month, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2336.3s)]
*  I think it will be a very hard sell for Mohammed bin Salman, who has none of the attachment to the Palestinian cause, it would seem, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2345.3s)]
*  for Mohammed bin Salman to sort of get Saudi policy around towards normalization. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2353.3s)]
*  What I think we have seen instead is a series of kind of messages, Saudi's like overflats, for example, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2360.3s)]
*  sort of messages that they won't normalize yet, but they will be willing to take measures that if and when Mohammed Salman does become king, he will then proceed. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2367.3s)]
*  And I think Mohammed Salman will have seen the sort of reputational benefits that UAE has received from normalizing and realized that when he becomes king, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2378.3s)]
*  he will have to do something big to try and restore his own reputation, especially in Western capitals. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2387.3s)]
*  I'd also just say that Bahrain's normalization is very interesting because it's a very useful test case for the Saudis in the sense that Bahrain has a very active and vocal political and civil society, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2394.3s)]
*  many of whom were very openly critical of the normalization deal the UAE signed before it became apparent that Bahrain would sign. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2406.3s)]
*  And from a Saudi point of view, anticipating any potential backlash within the kingdom to an announcement of normalization, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2415.3s)]
*  I think it's very useful to be able to tell from a Bahraini case whether or not rhetorical condemnation of normalization then turns into anything more direct of a threat to domestic stability and security. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2423.3s)]
*  Are these groups just issuing declarations of opposition or do they then take to the streets and really begin to sort of create difficulties for the regime? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2438.3s)]
*  So I think from a Saudi point of view, that's a very useful test case just to watch and to see how it proceeds in Bahrain's case because it could have implications for Saudi Arabia as well. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2448.3s)]
*  Thank you very much for that. That's really interesting. Marwan, I want to turn to Jordan, which we haven't since been mentioned, but not spoken of a lot. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2457.3s)]
*  Jordan, of course, being one of the two states that already has a peace agreement with Israel, which resolved an actual conflict over land. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2466.3s)]
*  What is the effect of the normalization agreements on Jordan? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2473.3s)]
*  And I would ask you to specifically address, I'm interested in the Temple Mount Haramah Sharif and Jordan's special relationship with Israel when it comes to Muslim holy sites. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2477.3s)]
*  I know Jordan certainly breathed the sigh of relief with the death of the Trump peace plan. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2488.3s)]
*  But where does that take us now? Does that mean from Jordan's perspective, we now go back to the two-state paradigm? [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2493.3s)]
*  I think it's good to remind us all once again, why Jordan went and signed a separate peace treaty with Israel in the first place. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2504.3s)]
*  Jordan's principal aim was to help end the occupation and establish a Palestinian state, a credible Palestinian state on Palestinian soil as the only way in Jordan's view that would not have Israel solve the conflict at Jordan's expense. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2512.3s)]
*  This is the reason why we went to Madrid and why we signed a peace treaty with Israel. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2531.3s)]
*  Now, if the land for peace formula is gone, if the two-state solution that this formula sort of prescribed is gone, Jordan is very concerned that once again the solution might come at its own expense. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2536.3s)]
*  Look, the demographics are clear. There are over seven million Palestinian Arabs living in Israel proper as opposed to Israel proper, West Bank and Gaza and Jerusalem as opposed to 6.8 million Israeli Jews. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2554.3s)]
*  Today, the Palestinians are a plurality inside Israel, soon to become an outright majority. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2570.3s)]
*  If Israel is not interested in ending the occupation, and I think it is clear that they are not. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2577.3s)]
*  Netanyahu has made this public many times. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2584.3s)]
*  And if they are not interested in keeping a majority of Palestinians in areas under their control, then Jordanian fear is that Israel might once again try to revive the notion that Jordan is Palestine. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2587.3s)]
*  So yes, Jordan is relieved that the Trump peace plan is gone because by annexing territory and by giving a US green light to annexing the territories, the two-state solution is basically gone. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2606.3s)]
*  But that does not mean that just because the Trump peace plan is gone that Israel is going to be serious about ending the occupation. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2622.3s)]
*  I think most analysts, I would say the overwhelming majority of analysts looking at the situation today will agree that the two-state solution is already dead. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2633.3s)]
*  Not because they or I wish it to be, but because if you look at the facts on the ground, there is no political will on part of the Israelis, on part of the international community to affect a two-state solution. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2645.3s)]
*  I mean, giving passive support to a two-state solution without a plan to implement it doesn't mean support for a peace two-state solution. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2661.3s)]
*  In fact, in my view, that has helped kill the two-state solution. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2671.3s)]
*  The demographics once again are indicative here. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2675.3s)]
*  Seven hundred thousand settlers in the West Bank and East Jerusalem today, more than 25 percent of the population of the West Bank. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2680.3s)]
*  There is no political will and the demographics suggest that affecting a two-state solution, which is basically based on the separation of the two communities, has become impossible. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2689.3s)]
*  And I think it is time for a paradigm shift in the peace process, one that starts focusing on Palestinian rights in addition to Israeli rights, one that focuses on a rights-based approach. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2702.3s)]
*  We cannot keep repeating the mantra, two-state solution, two-state solution, while doing nothing to affect it. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2717.3s)]
*  That is only giving Israel a green light to annex more territories and to create more facts on the ground that would render such a solution impractical. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2725.3s)]
*  Thank you. Zaha, I want to turn to you. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2738.3s)]
*  We have a bunch of questions from the audience and I'm going to try to put some of them together here. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2742.3s)]
*  We have questions about how, moving forward, what Palestinians need to do to look after their own interests. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2747.3s)]
*  What should the strategy of Palestinians be? [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2753.3s)]
*  We have related to that, what is the impact of the continuing Fatah Hamas division and how that should be dealt with going forward, certainly in the Biden context, how that will be navigated. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2755.3s)]
*  And then there's, I think, the question which hasn't come up at all here, which is Gaza. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2767.3s)]
*  Because when we talk about the Palestinians today, we mean everything, but really, the separation between Gaza and the West Bank is almost hermetically sealed off now. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2771.3s)]
*  So what should the strategy be going forward? [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2781.3s)]
*  And you can relate that to normalization or just talk about it in isolation either way. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2784.3s)]
*  What it should be, what it will be, two different things. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2789.3s)]
*  You know, right now, there's been a focus by the Palestinians, well, they've turned away from internal reform. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2794.3s)]
*  This was something that was spurred on, a focus on how to defragment the Palestinian people. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2804.3s)]
*  And then there's also a focus on how to defragment Palestinians in the occupied territories through the political defragmentation of Palestinians in the occupied territories, Gaza and the West Bank. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2814.3s)]
*  To do that with the pressure of the Trump peace plan hanging over their head and a need for a new strategy and a new political program to deal with the realities that are facing them. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2827.3s)]
*  That stopped when the Biden, when Biden, President-elect Biden was elected in November and the Palestinian strategy is now trying to signal to the Biden administration that the Palestinians are ready to reengage with the US. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2839.3s)]
*  And to really relaunch talks with Israel. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2857.3s)]
*  And I have to say that for most Palestinians on the ground, that is not the priority that they are interested in. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2863.3s)]
*  There's, you know, Palestinian public opinion is very much against relaunch of peace talks. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2872.3s)]
*  There's a real understanding by people living under the occupation that it's not going anywhere. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2879.3s)]
*  You know, settlement expansion is on steroids right now in the occupied territories. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2885.3s)]
*  You know, Gaza looks like it will not see an end to the blockade anytime soon and it's always under threat of violence with Israel. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2892.3s)]
*  So, you know, this is not a priority of Palestinians living day to day with the occupation. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2904.3s)]
*  But so what should the strategy be? I mean, Palestinian civil society has sort of almost written off the Palestinian leadership. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2912.3s)]
*  Elections aren't coming anytime soon and there's no prioritization of reform of the PLO. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2921.3s)]
*  The focus has been on the PA. So Palestinian civil society has really been, you know, engaged in efforts, both in the occupied territories and in conjunction with the Palestinian diaspora to sort of rethink [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2927.3s)]
*  the political program on their own and to rethink strategies towards dealing with, you know, what's happening around them, particularly with the Arab normalization with Israel. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2941.3s)]
*  And some of the some of the things that are being discussed are self-help, you know, how to get away from donor dependency and to focus on Palestinian capacities to change their own reality. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2954.3s)]
*  They're talking about ways to connect with each other and organize with each other, taking advantage of new platforms and technologies to be able to figure out ways to reimagine Palestine and to assert Palestinian identity despite the myriad ways in which it's being erased. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2968.3s)]
*  And as Israel moves forward with integrating West Bank settlements into the region, we can expect to see growing efforts aimed at disrupting the expropriation and exploitation of Palestinian natural resources and efforts to link up with international civil society in this regard. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=2987.3s)]
*  So, you know, there's the Palestinian leadership strategy and then there's the Palestinian civil society. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3005.3s)]
*  But I think as Arab normalization moves forward under Biden, the Palestinian leadership will have to rethink the internal reforms and re-engage Hamas and Fatah will have to re-engage on how to end the fragmentation, the political fragmentation between them and to incorporate Hamas and other factions under the regime. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3013.3s)]
*  And then to re-engage with the Palestinian leadership under the PLO umbrella and to again reestablish the PLO as the representative body of Palestinians everywhere and rethink the purpose and mandate of the Palestinian authority. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3043.3s)]
*  So that I think is I think Fatah Hamas divisions will in some sense be benefited in a way by the Arab normalization with Israel because it'll force the parties back to negotiations around how to end the disunity. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3058.3s)]
*  One thing under a Biden administration on the issue of Gaza is that there is a real sense that, you know, Gaza needs to be dealt with and the humanitarian situation can't be left unaddressed. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3081.3s)]
*  And I think there's, you know, there's going to have to be some effort to deal with the blockade and the siege of Gaza. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3096.3s)]
*  It's unconscionable and it should end. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3107.3s)]
*  It's been going on now for 13 years. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3110.3s)]
*  People, 2 million people unable to move about in a normal way. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3116.3s)]
*  And now with the pandemic, you know, locked into this small space, dependent completely on basic needs from outside. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3121.3s)]
*  So I think this is going to be increasingly a priority for the Biden administration moving forward. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3133.3s)]
*  Thank you for that. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3139.3s)]
*  That's very, very helpful. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3141.3s)]
*  So that actually leads into a question I want to ask Jake. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3143.3s)]
*  And I think we have time for a couple more questions so people can be fairly tight in their answers. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3146.3s)]
*  And Jake, I want to be a little provocative. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3150.3s)]
*  This is a question that came in from the audience and it's one that I share, which is the question of restore versus reset. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3152.3s)]
*  And when people talk about things the Biden administration might do to improve Israel, to improve ties to the Palestinians, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3159.3s)]
*  it tends to be in terms of rolling it back to what it was before Trump. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3166.3s)]
*  But before Trump, the policy was very much one that led very much to where we are today, right? [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3170.3s)]
*  It didn't, the Trump policy didn't come from nowhere. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3176.3s)]
*  Things were not on a great trajectory towards peace four years ago. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3179.3s)]
*  So what can a Biden administration do that would be more effective than rolling back to what was at the time a failed status quo? [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3182.3s)]
*  Well, I think everybody needs to be realistic in terms of what's possible. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3197.3s)]
*  And we've talked a lot about conditions not being right now for a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3204.3s)]
*  I think that's correct. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3213.3s)]
*  And whether you're a proponent of the two-state solution and want to see that as the ultimate objective, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3214.3s)]
*  or whether you believe in a rights-based approach, you want to use that as a way to get to an objective. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3219.3s)]
*  I think either way, you have to recognize that that's something for the future. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3225.3s)]
*  And so my view is that it's important for not just the Biden administration, but also the Israelis and the Palestinians [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3230.3s)]
*  to look for ways to preserve options for the future and to improve conditions on the ground now. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3237.3s)]
*  That would include, for example, the humanitarian aspect of Gaza that Zaha spoke about just a while ago. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3244.3s)]
*  But also, I think for the Palestinians, it means dealing with a lot of the internal and external issues that they face right now [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3251.3s)]
*  where they can't have an impact. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3259.3s)]
*  And that would include reforming the internal Palestinian structures of the PLO and the PA. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3261.3s)]
*  They haven't had elections in the West Bank and Gaza for 14 years now. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3266.3s)]
*  That's a concern about the legitimacy of the existing government, which is not great. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3271.3s)]
*  They've also got management issues within the PA, and they've got structural issues as well within the PLO that need to be dealt with. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3279.3s)]
*  Part of all that, of course, is comparing the breach between Fatah and Hamas and the West Bank and Gaza. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3287.3s)]
*  I don't use the term reconciliation for a particular reason. I don't think that Fatah and Hamas can be reconciled. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3294.3s)]
*  I think they've got fundamental differences on issues that have to be recognized. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3302.3s)]
*  And on some of those issues, they're going to have to agree to disagree. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3307.3s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that they can't find a way to unite the West Bank and Gaza under a single government. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3310.3s)]
*  That's where I think they should be looking at. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3316.3s)]
*  Now, that will be tricky vis-a-vis a Biden administration. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3321.3s)]
*  Anything dealing with Hamas will cause complications for the administration and assistance or working with the PA. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3324.3s)]
*  I think there's a way that that can be done. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3332.3s)]
*  So basically, to sum up, I would say it's important to focus on what can be done now and to preserve options for the future in terms of resolving the conflict [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3335.3s)]
*  and not to focus immediately on trying to resolve the conflict or set up a negotiating process that's doomed to failure. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3345.3s)]
*  Thank you. And Christian, I think you're going to get the last word. We're running out of time. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3352.3s)]
*  I want to ask you, with the growth of official and less official informal relations between Israel and Gulf states, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3358.3s)]
*  is there a risk that any regional fault lines in the Gulf might cross over into the Israeli-Palestinian dynamic? [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3366.3s)]
*  I mean, I think there has always been a risk, given that we've also seen Qatar's work in Gaza being used against Qatar in the context of the Gulf lift over the past three and a half years. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3374.3s)]
*  The Qatari response has been of a coordinate with Israel and with Israeli officials, having perhaps doing more so in much more of a detailed way than in the past. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3390.3s)]
*  But I think any potential reconciliation to use that term in the Gulf, if we're seeing that for real now over the next few weeks, [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3402.3s)]
*  I think that will at least hopefully obviate that risk that especially as UAE-Israel ties grow closer. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3410.3s)]
*  For example, any Emirati pressure on Israel to try to reassess the role that Qatar has been playing in Gaza would not necessarily be a productive thing, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3418.3s)]
*  just because the Qataris have provided much needed humanitarian and financial support and have done so in a way that has worked for Israel especially, [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3428.3s)]
*  and works also to some extent to provide some relief for the Palestinian people. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3436.3s)]
*  So I think we need to watch to make sure there is no overspill and to make sure that the Israeli-UAE dynamic doesn't lead to any pressure on Qatar and Gaza. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3441.3s)]
*  And we've seen just a week after the normalisation was announced between the UAE and Israel, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3452.3s)]
*  we saw the head of Mossad and the head of the Israeli Defence Forces head to Qatar to reach a deal for another six months of support. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3457.3s)]
*  And so I think the Israelis are trying to balance those different relationships and trying to do so in ways that don't bring that rift into yet another layer of issues [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3466.3s)]
*  onto what's already, as we've spoken about today, a multi-pronged friction and dynamic between Israel and the Palestinians. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3477.3s)]
*  Thanks. And actually, Marwan, I want you actually to get the last word, so please weigh in. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3484.3s)]
*  Laura, I want to make one important point in my view, which is I agree with Jake that in the immediate term, nothing much is going to take place, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3490.3s)]
*  whether on the Palestinian side or on the Israeli side. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3501.3s)]
*  But I think we need to understand that as the two-state solution becomes, as it becomes clear that the two-state solution is dead, [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3505.3s)]
*  the Palestinians are going to start asking for equal political rights in the areas they live in, because that's the only view they will, that's the only option they will have. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3513.3s)]
*  And if the international community cannot affect a Palestinian state on Palestinian soil that the Palestinians feel meets their minimum demands, [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3523.3s)]
*  it cannot keep saying no to a Palestinian state and no to equal political rights to the Palestinians, because that means yes to apartheid. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3535.3s)]
*  This is where the international community is headed. This is where the conflict is headed. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3546.3s)]
*  This is the dilemma that is going to face us all. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3552.3s)]
*  Either there is a credible plan to affect a Palestinian state in a very short period of time, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3555.3s)]
*  or the international community is going to have to deal with a state that occupies a majority sort of that is non-Jewish, [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3561.3s)]
*  which is the textbook definition with separate legal systems. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3573.3s)]
*  That's the textbook definition of apartheid. That's where the conflict is heading in my view. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3577.3s)]
*  Thank you. And I think that's a really powerful note to end on. I'm trying to end on time. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3583.3s)]
*  I want to thank everyone for joining us. Thanks to Carnegie. This was a terrific panel. It was an honor to moderate it. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-1giPCypaA&t=3588.3s)]
