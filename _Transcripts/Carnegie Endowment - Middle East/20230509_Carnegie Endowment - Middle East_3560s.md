# Disruptions and Dynamism in the Arab World
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [May 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok)
*  Good morning from Washington DC. I'm Frederick Wary, a senior fellow in the Middle East program [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=30.0s)]
*  at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. It's my pleasure to welcome you to [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=36.96s)]
*  this panel discussion on disruptions and dynamism in the Arab world. Since 2011, the Arab world [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  has undergone waves of upheaval and disruptions that have reshaped governance, state society [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=48.56s)]
*  relations, political economies, and geopolitics. Traditional narratives maintain that the region [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=54.08s)]
*  has settled into a phase of relative calm, marked by de-escalation, diplomacy, and inward turning [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=60.32s)]
*  moves toward economic reforms and authoritarian consolidation. Yet in many states, the socioeconomic [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=66.64s)]
*  afflictions that propelled the Arab uprisings are still present, and these problems have only been [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=73.68s)]
*  sharpened by a succession of global shocks that have hit the Arab world, sharpening inequalities [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=79.68s)]
*  within and between states. These include, of course, the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic fallout [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=85.68s)]
*  from the Ukraine War, the worsening impacts of climate change, to name just a few. And while oil [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=92.48s)]
*  exporting states are better positioned to weather these shocks, they too face enormous challenges [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  related to the looming end of the oil era and the imperatives of the energy transition. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=104.39999999999999s)]
*  It's my great pleasure now to welcome a terrific group of scholars to discuss these trends and the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=109.91999999999999s)]
*  future of the Arab order, drawing from a recently released Carnegie volume produced through generous [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=116.63999999999999s)]
*  funding from the Henry Luce Foundation, which is available on Carnegie's website. All of our [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=122.8s)]
*  panelists need no introduction to observers of the Middle East. Vesma Mamani is a full professor [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=129.28s)]
*  in the Department of Political Science and Assistant Vice President of Research and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=135.04s)]
*  International Affairs at the University of Waterloo in Canada. Michael Robbins is Director and [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=138.96s)]
*  Co-Principal Investigator of the Arab Barometer. Sultan Alamair is a visiting fellow at the Center [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=145.36s)]
*  of the Middle East Studies at Harvard University and also a PhD candidate in Political Science at [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=152.48s)]
*  George Washington University. Dalia Dasake is a Senior Fellow at the UCLA Burkle Center for [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=158.8s)]
*  International Relations. And finally, as a discussant, I'm thrilled to welcome Lisa Anderson, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  who is Special Lecturer and James T. Shotwell Professor and also Dean Emerita of the School [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=171.68s)]
*  of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University. And to our audience, we will have a [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=178.16000000000003s)]
*  live Q&A session where you can ask questions. To do so, use the live chat feature in YouTube. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=184.56s)]
*  Vesma, we'll start with you. Thank you so much for joining us. Your opening essay deals with [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=193.12s)]
*  socioeconomic inequalities in the Arab world, and it really, I think, links these afflictions to both [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=199.44s)]
*  global shocks, global uncertainties, but also decades of fiscal misgovernance in the Arab world. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=204.88s)]
*  Can you walk us through the key points and the implications for the future? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=212.16s)]
*  Yes. Thank you, Fred, and thank you to Carnegie for this opportunity. Indeed, I think the essay [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=217.44s)]
*  that I've produced is a bit on the pessimistic side, even though I do talk about a lot of [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=223.04s)]
*  uncertainties. And certainly, that's the buzzword, I think, we're all facing and trying to assess [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=227.6s)]
*  what's happening with the global economy. I mean, I think those of you who are avid watchers of the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=232.24s)]
*  IMF and World Bank annual meetings know that in the past couple of years, there has been just a [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=237.76s)]
*  continued revision of estimates and projections, a lot of just not clear where we're going. And of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=244.48s)]
*  course, part of that is COVID. COVID certainly, I think, put everybody into a bit of a tailspin. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=251.12s)]
*  But there are other, I think, factors ongoing. And one that I think really comes out of this essay, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=257.92s)]
*  or I hope to come on this essay, is really the US-China tension. This is a Cold War in the making. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=262.8s)]
*  I don't know if we've yet been able to pronounce it as such, but it certainly feels that way. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=270.32s)]
*  And of course, the impact on the Middle East is significant to the Arab world is, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=274.8s)]
*  or China is the Arab world's number one trading partner almost universally across the region. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=279.52s)]
*  And of course, China's very substantial role in the global economy is one that can't be ignored [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=285.44s)]
*  as perhaps the first or second largest economy, depending on how you measure it. So there are many, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=290.4s)]
*  many ramifications to this US-China Cold War. Certainly on the political side, I think for those [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=295.2s)]
*  of us who have been similarly watching and speaking about the liberal international order being [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=301.52s)]
*  kind of attacked from within, it feels as though I think there's just no more room for compromise. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=307.12s)]
*  Those of us who are old enough to remember the 2008 financial crisis felt that at least [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=312.64s)]
*  the G20 came together to try to get us out of this, to try to work together. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=318.24s)]
*  That sense of multilateralism is gone. And so the broader macroeconomic challenges are not just, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=322.72s)]
*  I think, just supply chain disruptions and inflation, but it's also the reality that there's [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=330.32s)]
*  just no political goodwill to cooperate in the same way. And we haven't even gotten into [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=335.44s)]
*  the populist nationalist pressures that exist globally, certainly not just in the United States [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=340.8s)]
*  with Trump or Trumpism, but it's also beyond that and including the Middle East. So if we look at [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=346.08s)]
*  Gulf countries today, Saudi Arabia, I'd say that many countries in the region feel very much [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=351.59999999999997s)]
*  emboldened from within. They want to chart their own path. We saw China's very interesting, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=357.59999999999997s)]
*  I think, rapprochement between the Iranians and Saudis as an opportunity for China to also [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=363.76s)]
*  exert more influence in the region. And I think for countries in the region too, like Saudi Arabia, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=369.76s)]
*  to exert more regional independence or independence globally from old allies, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=375.04s)]
*  including the United States and the West. So all of this, I think, is just part of the challenges. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  And I think the implications of this, as always, is really going to hit the most vulnerable hardest. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=384.8s)]
*  And that includes both within the region, the vulnerable being countries that are often oil [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=390.08000000000004s)]
*  importers or labor exporters, depending how you want to call it. But it's Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=394.8s)]
*  countries like Morocco, others who are increasingly not only linked heavily to the global economy as [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=401.59999999999997s)]
*  tourist destinations, as obviously oil importers, but for some countries like Egypt being dependent [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=408.71999999999997s)]
*  on Gulf investment. And the Gulf itself is now more populist, nationalist, as I said, and don't [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=415.2s)]
*  feel like bailing out other Arab countries for the sake of brotherly love, so to speak. So it's a [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=419.84s)]
*  really tough environment, again, politically and economically, and the vulnerable are going to be [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=425.6s)]
*  hurt the hardest. I'll add to that youth, which are really, I think, both the future and obviously [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  the most important segment socioeconomically to watch. Because as you alluded to earlier, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=438.16s)]
*  frustration of youth is never a good recipe for any country. And certainly, I think the Middle [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=444.48s)]
*  East, with a very young demographic profile, great aspirations, high, high levels of education, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=451.2s)]
*  expectations, and that sense of confidence in themselves is really high along the Arab [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=458.0s)]
*  youth segment. But the opportunities are just not there. And the Middle East, unfortunately, remains [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=464.48s)]
*  the most unequal region in the world within. Youth unemployment is absolutely terrifying. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=469.84s)]
*  And I think this all means, frankly, that the political environment in the countries [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=477.12s)]
*  are not going to be as stable as we think they are. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=480.88s)]
*  Terrific. Great points. And that's really a great scene setting presentation that raises a lot of [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=486.88s)]
*  other themes we dealt with in the study. I'd also preview some of the geopolitics that Dalia is going [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=492.24s)]
*  to discuss. And yeah, I really appreciate you raising the issue of youth and also this idea of [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=498.64s)]
*  no more blank checks from the Gulf states with regard to Egypt. Again, very distressing picture [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=503.92s)]
*  you've painted. Michael, turning to you and building on some of these themes, you and your [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=510.72s)]
*  co-author, Amani Jamal, drew upon the very rich survey work in the Arab barometer to really use [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=517.28s)]
*  the COVID-19 pandemic as a lens to examine how public views of government legitimacy, services, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=525.2s)]
*  civil liberties, agenda are shifting. So I wonder if you could draw out some of the main points of [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=533.2s)]
*  your essay. And then also, since China is featuring so much in our discussion, if you could discuss [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=539.76s)]
*  Arab public opinion views of China. And I guess more broadly, and I'm adding to the list here, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=545.0400000000001s)]
*  why does public opinion matter? Because we often think these are authoritarian states. But again, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=552.48s)]
*  why we should listen to this pulse of the region. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=557.6s)]
*  Thanks so much, Fred. Thank you as well to Carnegie for this volume. We were really excited to have the [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=560.0s)]
*  opportunity to share some of the results from Arab barometer. We conduct public opinion surveys [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=565.28s)]
*  across the region. We've been doing this since 2006 to really try and take the pulse and include [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=569.68s)]
*  the Arab publics in the discussion. And I think that is important. We've seen that [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=574.4799999999999s)]
*  in authoritarian states, often governments do have to change, do have to certainly in after 2011, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=578.88s)]
*  we saw the protests leading to massive shifts in a number of countries. Other countries took this [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=584.56s)]
*  very seriously. So it is important to think about what do publics want, not just for that, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=588.64s)]
*  but also because this is really the story of the people of the region and something that we do see [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=592.48s)]
*  a lot of suffering. So one of the things that we focus on this paper is really kind of domestic [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=597.52s)]
*  political actors thinking through how views of them may have changed about economic issues, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=602.16s)]
*  political rights and gender, and I'll also touch on China briefly. But in terms of domestic political [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=607.04s)]
*  actors, we actually saw a bit of hope at the beginning of the pandemic as governments took [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=612.16s)]
*  strong steps to try and contain the pandemic lockdowns in places like Jordan, major restrictions. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=615.44s)]
*  The government essentially seemed to take the needs of the public seriously to try and keep [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=620.8000000000001s)]
*  them safe. We saw a slight bump in our surveys in terms of views of government itself. This really [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=624.24s)]
*  started to decline pretty dramatically over the period of the pandemic as the pandemic spread, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=629.5200000000001s)]
*  as lockdowns were not as popular as there were significant challenges. And we do see that there's [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=634.24s)]
*  essentially been a loss of trust in the government out of the pandemic. And a large part that seems [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=640.0s)]
*  to come from the economic conditions that resulted. We do see that even though the economic [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=644.32s)]
*  conditions were quite low and many countries lower than they were in 2011 in terms of public [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=648.72s)]
*  perception, we see that this has actually fallen pretty dramatically. And in fact, this can be [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=652.88s)]
*  seen very clearly on a number of important issues. For example, these are formerly middle income [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=657.44s)]
*  countries. Still some are considered middle income countries. But in a place like Egypt, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=662.24s)]
*  two thirds of people said that they've gotten hungry in the past year. They haven't been able [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=666.08s)]
*  to afford food. And half the countries we surveyed in the last wave, in six of 12, majority said [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=669.44s)]
*  that they could not afford food at some point during the past year. So there is a very dire [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=674.24s)]
*  situation. A lot of this comes down to what we see are changing costs of living. That people have [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=678.48s)]
*  felt the effects of inflation, the rising costs of basic goods. And so a lot of people say more [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=683.44s)]
*  than a lack of goods, it's really the rising costs. There isn't a way for them to afford [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=688.48s)]
*  their lives. This has really been one of the main effects of COVID. And about one in five really [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=694.96s)]
*  say this has been the primary effect of COVID. It hasn't been health related, but it has been [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=699.28s)]
*  related to either the economy or the job market. And so we do see the economic effects of COVID [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=703.04s)]
*  really being long lasting. And in fact, outside of Morocco, we don't see the government having, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=709.4399999999999s)]
*  people perceiving the government having done much to help them in terms of either economic [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=714.64s)]
*  benefits or some other type of aid to get them through this crisis. So the start of the pandemic [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=718.3199999999999s)]
*  seemed like it might be more positive for governments of the region. But overall, as we've [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=724.0799999999999s)]
*  seen the economic challenges rise up, these challenges continue. People have become less [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=727.68s)]
*  or pessimistic in the vast majority of countries towards their basic governments. And we also see [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=733.28s)]
*  one of the other elements that's coming out is the wealth and perceptions and equality that as [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=739.4399999999999s)]
*  there were certain winners and losers potentially from the COVID pandemic, we do see that people [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=744.3199999999999s)]
*  perceive the wealth gap as a problem. And the vast majority across the region are saying this is [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=749.12s)]
*  growing significantly in the past year, that this is not just something that is there is stagnant, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=752.4799999999999s)]
*  but it is growing as a problem. And so people do perceive that this has really had a huge effect [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=757.44s)]
*  on their economic well being. As we've seen, as Basma was mentioning the economic challenges, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=762.4000000000001s)]
*  this is something that citizens really do feel and we have seen the lowest ever marks in many [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=769.6800000000001s)]
*  countries for how the economy is doing at this point. We also looked at a few other elements, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=774.8000000000001s)]
*  and one of them was political rights. And so this is something that was particularly restricted [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=779.84s)]
*  during lockdowns during COVID. We saw some governments taking the opportunity in a sense [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=782.96s)]
*  to use COVID to perhaps crack down, to limit the basic rights that citizens may have had or to at [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=788.08s)]
*  least to make those rights even weaker. One of the surprising things we found is that citizens [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=794.48s)]
*  actually perceive perhaps as lockdowns have been lessened that they do have a greater right to [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=802.08s)]
*  freedom of expression, freedom to gather, freedom of association, other elements that we have seen [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=806.4000000000001s)]
*  a slight increase. And in part that may be twofold factors. One is that we did see a significant [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=811.28s)]
*  decrease in this from 2016 to 2018 and maybe in some ways a change back that people have [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=816.72s)]
*  forgotten kind of that older feeling, but also the changes as these restrictions have been lifted, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=823.36s)]
*  that likely this is another factor that people feel that they have more rights than a couple [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=828.48s)]
*  years ago. So even if that isn't necessarily improved from the past, but people are still [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=832.4s)]
*  overall pessimistic. In the vast majority of countries, majorities say that they don't have [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=837.12s)]
*  the right to freedom of expression, that they don't have the right to protest peacefully or [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=841.84s)]
*  demonstrate peacefully. So there still is a major problem here, but it hasn't necessarily affected [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=846.32s)]
*  at least the public perceptions to the degree we thought they might. On a third issue that we [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=850.88s)]
*  looked at, which was gender, it is one of the key issues across the region is women's equality. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=855.68s)]
*  We actually see some good news here that historically there's been a perception that [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=861.04s)]
*  men are better in public leadership, as political leaders, and that men also should have more say [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=864.4s)]
*  in the home. And that still actually holds true. In most countries we survey, there still is a [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=869.76s)]
*  sense that men should take priority over women in both public and private spheres. However, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=873.76s)]
*  this trend has started to change. It has largely been flat since about 2013. There hadn't been a [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=878.56s)]
*  significant change over time, but there was in the last way between 2018 and 2019 right before the [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=884.0799999999999s)]
*  pandemic and now after the pandemic, or at least after the main effects of the pandemic, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=888.88s)]
*  we do see changes here. So in a number of countries, particularly Tunisia, Lebanon, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=894.08s)]
*  but others as well, we've seen about six to eight point changes and people saying no, women [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=897.68s)]
*  disagreeing with the statement that men are better at political leadership. We also see this in the [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=902.16s)]
*  home saying that men should have the final say in the household. We've seen a similar decline in [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=906.0s)]
*  half the countries with those agreeing that men should have the final say. So it does seem that [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=910.96s)]
*  some of the roles for women, and there's literature around the world, thinking about how [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=915.44s)]
*  the different changes, some of the lockdowns, some of the other factors that change social relations [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=921.7600000000001s)]
*  may have an effect on gender. And so it does seem that perhaps this is finally moving more [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=927.0400000000001s)]
*  towards women's equality overall. And finally, since you asked, thinking a bit more about China, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=931.84s)]
*  we do see a significant shift in views of China. I'm not as sure this is related to necessarily [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=937.7600000000001s)]
*  the pandemic itself, but we have seen a decrease overall in the percent who say that they really [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=941.68s)]
*  have positive views of China. And for example, as we're seeing people across the region who say they [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=947.28s)]
*  want closer relations with China, we've seen a little bit of a decline over the last five years. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=952.8s)]
*  And so it does seem that perhaps these people are getting to know China better as they're [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=958.0799999999999s)]
*  understanding Chinese engagement with the region as China has moved in more. Clearly, there is [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=961.12s)]
*  potentially a lesser desire for closer relations with China overall. Again, this is still topping [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=965.92s)]
*  the US in all countries except Morocco. Basically, there is a more popular view of China, or at least [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=971.52s)]
*  an equally popular view, except in Morocco. But overall, there is a sense that we have in the [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=978.64s)]
*  surveys we've done that China is at least coming down. It certainly isn't at the levels it was [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=983.68s)]
*  three or five or seven years ago. And so the region, as it gets to know China better, is less likely [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=988.64s)]
*  to engage. And in part, I think that's because of the way China is engaging economically. That is, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=994.56s)]
*  we've asked people, what is your view of Chinese business? What is your view of Chinese companies? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=998.88s)]
*  It does seem to be very poor. The people are not as inclined to think of China as a good partner. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1003.6s)]
*  They're more likely to think of German companies or American companies as being preferable for [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1009.12s)]
*  doing work in the region. So certainly, as China engages economically, we do think that this is [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1013.04s)]
*  likely to decrease in the views of the public, that they are less likely to want engagement with [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1017.68s)]
*  China. So those are some of the main findings for our chapter. And thank you for putting this together. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1021.52s)]
*  Fascinating. Thank you so much for covering so much ground and some great points for our discussion. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1029.2s)]
*  And yeah, really rich set of observations that in some cases runs counter to common perception. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1034.48s)]
*  So Sultan, building on that, I want to turn to you. Your co-authored piece with Nathan Brown, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1041.2800000000002s)]
*  I think really speaks to one of the main themes of the evolving Arab order since 2011, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1047.44s)]
*  that the pandemic really sort of amplified. And that's this authoritarian consolidation [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1053.44s)]
*  or retrenchment or really upgrading really that these rulers are getting smarter. They're learning [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1060.0800000000002s)]
*  lessons. They're becoming more technologically savvy in terms of how they monitor and control [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1065.5200000000002s)]
*  citizens behavior. Now, you and Nathan have identified what you see as a very innovative mode [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1071.2s)]
*  of this sort of authoritarian governance at work in Saudi Arabia and Egypt, which you call [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1077.6s)]
*  legibility, which I think differs in some sense from sort of old fashioned surveillance. So if [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1082.96s)]
*  you could walk us through that and also the implications of that for stability. Yeah, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1088.72s)]
*  thank you very much. So basically, historically speaking, when we talk about the Arab state, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1095.36s)]
*  it is a state that it is more, we speak in terms of capacity versus repression. Arab states are [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1101.92s)]
*  characterized historically to be more repressive state, but administratively weak. They lack the [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1109.1200000000001s)]
*  ability to implement policies, provide targeted services, and they can't monitor the outcomes of [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1116.3200000000002s)]
*  the policies that they put in place. This has changed recently. And in the paper, we characterize [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1126.16s)]
*  this new change in state capacity and its ability to provide targeted policies and implement them [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1134.24s)]
*  and ability to monitor and guide and change and influence citizens behavior. And this has been [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1143.1200000000001s)]
*  done and we used the cases of Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Saudi Arabia made an advanced steps in that [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1149.84s)]
*  track, whereas Egypt is a newcomer. And many of the policies that we focused on has to do with [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1160.1599999999999s)]
*  consumption and regulating informality. So in both cases and in both fields, and these fields are not [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1168.8s)]
*  the traditional fields where security concerns are high and the states invest much resources in [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1178.4s)]
*  getting to conduct some kind of surveillance and monitoring its population and citizens. But in these [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1185.44s)]
*  fields, normally states historically adapted some kind of blunt and indiscriminate policies. But [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1194.8000000000002s)]
*  what we are seeing recently is that these two states are adopting more targeted policies by [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1205.52s)]
*  using technology in order to extract more information about population and using this information to [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1213.44s)]
*  enhance the ability and decrease the cost of the provision of services and enhance the ability and [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1219.76s)]
*  the legibility of the citizens and societies and markets to better extract resources and tax them [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1228.16s)]
*  in the market. So this has been going on for a while and by identifying this trend, we then discussed [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1237.68s)]
*  what are the issues or problems with that kind of a new trend. The first thing is that there are no [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1247.68s)]
*  reciprocity. Governments, citizens are becoming more legible to the states, but states are becoming [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1254.88s)]
*  less transparent. Most of the new mega-project and states policies have been conducted [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1261.44s)]
*  by the using of privately owned funds by these governments. And the in-and-out workings of these [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1271.68s)]
*  funds and the companies that many institutions and ministries are using to implement these policies [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1278.72s)]
*  are not open to public inspection or granted that both states are authoritarian, but in the past, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1287.2s)]
*  there was this limited ability of transparency where people can observe and see how things are [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1300.8s)]
*  being done, but now even these small amount of transparency are being limited more and more. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1309.68s)]
*  The second problem is that these projects are expensive and require a lot of resources and we [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1316.0s)]
*  draw a parallel between what's happening now with what happened to the Ottoman Empire and Egypt, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1322.8799999999999s)]
*  Iran and Tunisia in the 19th century where excessive expansion in state capacity [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1328.96s)]
*  attempts to move from indirect rule to direct rule caused most of these states to go bankrupt by [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1338.72s)]
*  the late 19th century. And then after concluding this discussion, we tried to investigate how [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1345.1200000000001s)]
*  this would look like in the future. And we thought that in the short term, these [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1354.4s)]
*  tools, technological tools might be helpful for these states to implement successfully [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1362.48s)]
*  more targeted, more enhanced, more effective policies that would generate good results in [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1370.3200000000002s)]
*  the short term. But if this turns this authoritarian way of increasing the legibility of citizenry [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1376.8000000000002s)]
*  without being transparent and without involving citizens in the decision-making of the policy, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1384.1599999999999s)]
*  we think that it would lead to a more unclear and uncertain future, especially with the increase [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1391.28s)]
*  of expansion and the lack of resources, especially in the case of Egypt, which the economic crisis [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1402.08s)]
*  has already taken place in that country. Thank you very much. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1409.76s)]
*  Great. Yeah. And I think that really speaks to some broader trends in the Arab world, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1418.24s)]
*  this preference for short-term technical technocratic solutions in lieu of broader [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1422.8799999999999s)]
*  political reforms. We see this, of course, with climate change, which we haven't discussed, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1428.96s)]
*  but hopefully we will. Dalia, last but not least, I want to turn to you. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1433.6s)]
*  You and I authored the concluding essay on geopolitics, which I think takes stock of the [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1438.56s)]
*  trend in Arab de-escalation and detente. But the essay also brings in the often ignored domestic [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1445.76s)]
*  dimension in Arab states as a driver for this reshuffling of the regional order, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1453.9199999999998s)]
*  in addition to local perceptions of the US retreat in the region and the rise of other [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1459.84s)]
*  great powers. If you could outline some of the key points of that piece and with a view toward [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1465.76s)]
*  US policy. Thanks, Fred. And thank you for the opportunity and congratulations on a great volume. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1472.16s)]
*  And it was a pleasure to write this with you. Yeah. So our chapter zoomed out a bit, looking [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1480.64s)]
*  at these regional realignments and the new global context. There's a lot of points to make. I'll [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1486.48s)]
*  focus on three. Fred, you just mentioned one of them, which is that we do this idea that all of [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1493.04s)]
*  these realignments and de-escalation that we're seeing, a very common argument is that this is [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1500.6399999999999s)]
*  all about the United States, the regions reacting to the United States. And there's no doubt that [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1506.8s)]
*  what the US does or does not do has a great amount of influence on the region. But we also suggest [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1511.52s)]
*  that the region has its own agency. States have their own agency. They're increasingly assertive. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1518.08s)]
*  And we do make this connection between the domestic confidence that we're seeing, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1523.6s)]
*  largely as a result of these states, frankly, succeeding in suppressing the Arab uprisings. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1528.0s)]
*  And this is given confidence that they no longer need to play out their ideological conflicts in [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1534.6399999999999s)]
*  the neighborhood. So we do inject that domestic element to make an argument that it is not just [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1540.88s)]
*  about the United States, why we're seeing this kind of new dynamic element in the region. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1547.8400000000001s)]
*  The second, I think, area we spend a lot of time on is we survey the various de-escalations underway [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1554.4s)]
*  and realignments. And while they're certainly positive, we also point to a lot of the limitations [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1561.0400000000002s)]
*  of all of these developments. I'm not going to go through all of them here, but of course, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1567.6s)]
*  one of the most significant ones is the end of this, or for the time being, end of the [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1571.36s)]
*  intra-Sunni divide and fissure between the anti-Islamic, Islamist block led by Egypt, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1578.56s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, and the UAE against Turkey and Qatar. That is by and large over. And that, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1586.56s)]
*  of course, is helping to tamp down and de-escalate conflicts in countries that, Fred, you focus on [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1594.72s)]
*  quite a bit, like Libya. The other big de-escalation underway, which is getting daily headlines, is, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1600.48s)]
*  of course, Saudi Iran. It didn't start with the Saudis, the Emiratis, as they often do in the case [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1606.08s)]
*  with bringing Assad in from the cold, the Emiratis kind of led the way. And now we are seeing this [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1612.8s)]
*  normalization between the Saudis and the Iranians, brokered by China. So, this is all good news, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1618.72s)]
*  of course, in terms of trying to reduce the potential for renewed conflict in these [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1626.0s)]
*  devastating wars like Yemen. But what we do argue is that all of them have, it's not clear yet how [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1632.88s)]
*  sustainable these efforts are. There's a lot of mistrust that remains among all of these parties. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1641.76s)]
*  There's also a lot of euphoria about these developments, as if they're brand new. But, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1648.0s)]
*  you know, if you put it in context, the Saudis and Iranians have been rivals for a long time. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1653.04s)]
*  Their relationship has ebb and flowed over the years. At the end of the day, they're normalizing [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1658.56s)]
*  relationships that were already there. So, of course, we're not saying it's not good news, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1663.52s)]
*  but we should also, you know, stay calm and measure it in our response of how far this will go. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1668.96s)]
*  And that's not to mention the fact that we have the continuing, not-so-shadow war between Israel [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1676.8s)]
*  and Iran and continuing tensions between the U.S. and Iran. So, peace is not breaking out in the [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1683.04s)]
*  Middle East. And if we need any reminder of that, the horrific conflict underway in Sudan now is, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1688.1599999999999s)]
*  I think, a rude awakening that these fissures are not completely done. And then lastly, we look at [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1695.04s)]
*  the international global landscape and this, you know, new era of multipolarity, great power [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1701.84s)]
*  competition, which all the regional players are navigating. And we really challenge these very, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1707.6799999999998s)]
*  we think, kind of simplistic narratives that, you know, China's taking over or the U.S. is leaving. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1714.6399999999999s)]
*  And we try to add some reality and complexity into those narratives. You know, if you, even if the [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1720.32s)]
*  regional states didn't have this very strong perception, which they do, that the U.S. has [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1726.6399999999999s)]
*  left them. That's not quite the reality, but that is certainly the perception. Even if that was the [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1732.32s)]
*  case, China's not disappearing from this region by pure economic and energy calculus alone, as we just [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1737.6799999999998s)]
*  heard earlier. You know, lately I'm seeing a lot of responses saying, oh, why is China so involved [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1744.3999999999999s)]
*  in this region? It was the Aramco attack in 2019, and certainly that had a big impact. But let's [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1751.04s)]
*  face it, Mohammed bin Salman was starting to visit China long before that. His first trip was in 2014. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1757.12s)]
*  Saudi-Chinese energy, sorry, trade relationships have just absolutely expanded exponentially. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1764.1599999999999s)]
*  If you look at the numbers in 1990, there was something like 400 million in trade by 2019, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1773.92s)]
*  during this year of the Aramco attack. Trade had already gone up to over $70 billion. So China has [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1780.56s)]
*  staying power in this region, regardless of what the United States is doing. It doesn't mean China [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1789.04s)]
*  is taking over the region. And same goes with Russia. They're more opportunistic, but they have [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1794.48s)]
*  shown their staying power both in Syria, as well as their ability to blunt the western effect of [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1800.24s)]
*  western sanctions because of the Ukraine war in their very lucrative relationships with a number [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1807.44s)]
*  of regional states, particularly in the Gulf. So I think these ideas that, you know, if only the U.S. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1813.04s)]
*  would give more arms, more sanctions, more military force presence, that, you know, the U.S. could get [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1820.0s)]
*  back to where it was before is just kind of not really in touch with the realities that we're [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1826.3200000000002s)]
*  facing in today's Middle East. And the other, I think, important point to underscore here is that [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1832.16s)]
*  the neighborhood is not just hedging. They're doing a lot of that. But they also, a number of [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1839.92s)]
*  these states with the authoritarian consolidation that Fred and others refer to, they also find a [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1845.44s)]
*  lot in common with some of these other global patrons. They're not going to the eastern option [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1851.28s)]
*  because they're being forced to it. They actually are welcoming it in many respects. So we conclude [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1857.52s)]
*  that this veneer of stability and de-escalation and de-escalation is real and should be welcomed. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1864.6399999999999s)]
*  But without addressing the underlying socioeconomic pressures and governance challenges that the rest [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1875.28s)]
*  of this volume is dealing with, we really think that the potential for the re-emergence of instability [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1882.56s)]
*  that could again spill over across this region is still very much there. So not to end on too [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1889.28s)]
*  pessimistic of a note because we do want to welcome this great emergence of peacemaking in the region, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1894.6399999999999s)]
*  but we do counter it with some dose of realism. Great. No, that was a cautionary note, not [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1902.08s)]
*  necessarily a pessimistic one. So some really great points there and especially appreciate you [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1909.44s)]
*  bringing in the issue of the ideological affinity between local autocrats and powers like China and [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1913.6000000000001s)]
*  Russia, especially in contrast to the U.S., which imposes more conditions, albeit unevenly, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1921.68s)]
*  on its assistance. Lots to discuss there. Before I turn to our final speaker, I want to turn to our [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1929.1200000000001s)]
*  audience and remind you that you can ask a question using the live chat feature in YouTube [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1936.0s)]
*  or you can tweet at us at Carnegie and Dow or you can use the hashtag Ask Carnegie. So now I'm very [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1942.56s)]
*  pleased to welcome our discussant, Lisa Anderson, who has the unenviable task of tying these threads [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1950.16s)]
*  together, commenting on them and also offering her thoughts on the future of the Arab Order. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1959.68s)]
*  Lisa, you've tackled a lot of these themes in your own writings. I want to mention, of course, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1965.68s)]
*  your excellent piece in Foreign Affairs recently on the U.S., sort of the demise of the U.S.-led [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1969.44s)]
*  order or U.S. ambitions, but also an earlier piece you wrote in Cairo, the Cairo Review, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1976.48s)]
*  which I, on the Arab Order, which I think echoes a lot of the themes in our study. So again, over to [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1981.76s)]
*  you, your reactions, comments, and please feel free to address the panelists with questions. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1987.3600000000001s)]
*  Thanks very much and thank you for including me in this program and for the volume itself, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=1995.68s)]
*  which I think is enormously fruitful and I hope everyone who cares at all about the region [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2002.8s)]
*  takes advantage of the work that you all have done. I want to perhaps start with a question that we [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2010.72s)]
*  will, I will pose to everyone involved. The sort of tone of the volume is quite pessimistic, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2017.28s)]
*  a lot of discussion of worrying trends and darkening horizons and you get some of that in this [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2027.6s)]
*  panel, but I think one of my questions you have to ask is sort of, so what do we think is actually [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2034.6399999999999s)]
*  going to happen? And I want to come back to that a little bit because I think one of my questions [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2043.36s)]
*  that, you know, provokes that question is who's listening? Who do we want to think differently [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2053.68s)]
*  about the region and why is it so difficult to get some of the issues that you and your colleagues, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2061.44s)]
*  Fred, have surfaced onto policy agendas of people in Washington, but for that matter in Europe or [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2070.32s)]
*  anywhere else in the world, who are making policy on and in the region, why is this such a difficult [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2079.92s)]
*  kind of conversation? My sense is that there's a lot of, you know, essentially whistling in the [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2088.6400000000003s)]
*  wind of people thinking that what we did yesterday is going to work tomorrow when it has demonstrably [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2095.28s)]
*  failed yesterday and yet we don't have very many ideas about alternative approaches and strategies. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2102.0s)]
*  That's probably true of the United States and foreign policy in general, but it certainly seems [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2108.8s)]
*  to me to be true in terms of American foreign policy to the Middle East. So why is it that we [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2113.6800000000003s)]
*  don't see the looming problems that this volume so powerfully suggests we should be confronting? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2120.96s)]
*  I think, you know, partly clearly there are a lot of changes in the global outlook in general and [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2129.2s)]
*  people are distracted by that and I think there's a fair amount of wishful thinking that if no one [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2136.64s)]
*  pays any attention problems will go away. These are all aspects of human beings, I suppose, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2142.96s)]
*  but I'd also like to suggest, and this is where I'd really like to sort of focus on some of what [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2150.64s)]
*  you've been able to do in this volume, I think we have a kind of collective conceptual blinders of [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2156.16s)]
*  some of the language we use and the underlying assumptions we make about how politics works [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2163.92s)]
*  in much of the world today. So we, you know, talk about the kinds of [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2170.48s)]
*  aspects of economic change or new technologies and so forth that are reshaping the state, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2178.0s)]
*  but I'd like to suggest that in fact part of our problem in conceptualizing how to make policy is [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2185.2s)]
*  this somewhat kind of miss, at this point, misbegotten focus on the state. The state obviously [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2191.92s)]
*  has become, you know, ubiquitous in the world thanks to the United Nations and [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2204.56s)]
*  that sort of assumption that everybody is organized in the state [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2211.6800000000003s)]
*  for the last 75 or 80 years, but I would like to argue, as many other people do, that in much of [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2215.12s)]
*  the world, and in fact most of the global south, what we call a state, you know, a flag and a seat [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2221.12s)]
*  at the United Nations is really a fig leaf for other kinds of purposes of government that rulers [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2228.4s)]
*  have interests that are not very easily characterized in terms of these states. So I think that's [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2235.2799999999997s)]
*  the problem in terms of these states. They're not doing state building. They're not interested in [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2243.28s)]
*  developing a public sphere. The loss of trust that the arborometer has so clearly demonstrated [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2250.6400000000003s)]
*  is mutual, that the governments don't trust their people, just as the people don't trust their [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2261.2000000000003s)]
*  And in some respects, I think Dahlia's observation that we're talking about parties [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2266.72s)]
*  to various kinds of agreements and in various kinds of conflicts might be a better [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2273.4399999999996s)]
*  language than talking about states. So let me suggest a couple of ways in which this volume [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2279.8399999999997s)]
*  actually furthers that argument. If you'll recall the definition that we all grew up with as [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2286.72s)]
*  scholars and policy people of a state as Javer's old monopoly of the legitimate use of force in [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2298.9599999999996s)]
*  given territory, and one of the articles in the volume demonstrates pretty clearly that that [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2305.7599999999998s)]
*  notion of how the use of force is organized is no longer around armies in a conventional [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2312.4s)]
*  mid-20th century way. There's a proliferation of armed groups, some of which are beholden to [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2319.28s)]
*  governments and some of which are not. There are, as we say, state and non-state actors. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2324.96s)]
*  The consolidating of surveillance, too, that we've heard about, that's an excellent piece. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2331.76s)]
*  They all are, but it's not about territory. It's about populations. And so the notion that these are [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2340.0s)]
*  rulers concerned with territorial integrity, I think is no longer the case, if it ever was, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2349.44s)]
*  and therefore our conviction that this is about states in the old-fashioned sense of the world [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2356.32s)]
*  is where it is part of our problem. That's really not what the rulers are thinking about. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2363.36s)]
*  When you think about the kinds of populations that they have to worry about, clearly [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2369.3599999999997s)]
*  people are scattered increasingly across territories. The volume itself talks about how [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2374.56s)]
*  many Egyptians are working in the Gulf, how many people are being deployed in these state and [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2383.6s)]
*  non-state armed groups inside and outside conventionally understood state boundaries. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2391.04s)]
*  Armed groups are developing networks across the region. In fact, I would argue that there are also [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2396.64s)]
*  business networks across the region that are sort of public-private partnerships that don't reflect [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2404.3999999999996s)]
*  very much of, again, what we would conventionally understand as state interests. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2412.24s)]
*  So my sense is that you're really describing a landscape that has not only changed quite [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2417.6s)]
*  dramatically since the uprisings or perhaps since the financial crisis of 2008, has empowered certain [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2426.0s)]
*  figures, certain parties, certain rulers, if you want to say that, and weakened others, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2437.52s)]
*  but it's also beginning to be a substantial shift in the way many, many people, both among the [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2444.48s)]
*  citizens and among the rulers, conceptualize their opportunities, their responsibilities, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2454.88s)]
*  and so forth, a kind of gestalt shift. And from that perspective, I do think if we can move away [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2461.6800000000003s)]
*  from the sort of assuming that these are states and actually asking whether in any given moment [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2470.0s)]
*  they are behaving as states or as business interests or as other kinds of identity groups [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2478.48s)]
*  and so forth, I think we would understand a lot better what kind of interlocutors we're interacting [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2486.96s)]
*  with and what kind of policies we might pursue. So let me just suggest that I think that the [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2495.84s)]
*  observation about the extent to which the investments that are being made by, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2504.7200000000003s)]
*  I would describe these managers in surveilling what I would increasingly describe as their [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2513.28s)]
*  what I would increasingly describe as their employees and customers rather than rulers [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2519.84s)]
*  and citizens, those investments are in fact very, very expensive. And the likelihood that a number [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2526.0s)]
*  of these governments go bankrupt seems to me to be pretty high. So we are looking at a situation [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2531.6s)]
*  that was, we've seen before in the region 150 years ago or so, and I wonder whether [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2537.36s)]
*  that wouldn't give us an opportunity to think about what the future might look like. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2545.8399999999997s)]
*  Because just as the imperial powers of the day were sort of public-private partnerships, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2550.7999999999997s)]
*  I would imagine that we will see as these [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2559.12s)]
*  governments unravel in bankruptcy that we will see public-private partnerships coming into [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2564.3999999999996s)]
*  in the modern 21st century way sort of pick out what might be profitable and leave the rest. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2571.2799999999997s)]
*  And that's not a pretty picture, but it might be worth thinking about that as a way to think about [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2578.0s)]
*  the future. So yes, I think the horizons are darkening, but I think we probably want to try [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2583.92s)]
*  and pick out some of the trends that will give us a little bit of purchase on how exactly this [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2589.2s)]
*  will likely play out in the next decade or so. So let me stop there. I think it is, as you can tell, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2597.36s)]
*  enormously provocative. And I look forward both to the discussion now and to any subsequent [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2603.28s)]
*  discussions that this volume produces, because I think I would love to have more discussion of [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2612.48s)]
*  these kinds of issues in the policy world. Great. No, you really raised well a whole [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2620.4s)]
*  another study, which is what think tanks like to do. So again, I really appreciate you raising some [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2626.4s)]
*  super provocative issues and especially this notion of a conceptual blinder, the misbegotten [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2632.48s)]
*  notion of the state, especially appropriate to a country you and I focus on, Libya. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2637.6800000000003s)]
*  What is the state, the devolution of state-like powers to other actors? And I think the need for [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2643.8399999999997s)]
*  a new vocabulary to describe this landscape and the essay that you alluded to on armed groups is [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2651.12s)]
*  by Eleonora Ardemani, and she gets into what's called hybrid security governance. So again, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2657.68s)]
*  formal and informal actors working side by side. Again, your last point, I think, on private, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2663.7599999999998s)]
*  public or government partnerships raises the issue of what do we talk about when we mean [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2668.72s)]
*  belonging in these entities? Are we talking about citizens, customers? What kind of social contract [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2674.7999999999997s)]
*  is arising in the region? And I think you're right to push us in the direction of the future [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2680.72s)]
*  that may not be one of complete catastrophe, but reconfiguration. So again, a lot of provocative [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2686.16s)]
*  points. I want to turn it over to our panelists for some reactions and especially this question, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2694.4s)]
*  who's listening or who should we address these points to and why is it so difficult to get the [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2700.64s)]
*  issues on the table? Anyone want to start out with that question or any other points that Lisa raised? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2707.44s)]
*  I'll jump in. Thank you, Lisa, for the interventions and the commentary. I think it's really [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2717.2s)]
*  valuable for us to really push us further. I mean, I think what really stood out to me [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2725.04s)]
*  from your comments is this question of what's the engine of growth? Who's going to get us out of this [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2729.3599999999997s)]
*  misery that we're seeing the region in? I mean, the numbers are pretty clear. And I want to say [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2735.6s)]
*  that's really more for the resource-poor countries. I mean, there's a flip side [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2740.48s)]
*  observation, which is the Gulf region is super optimistic and is growing and there's a lot of [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2746.0s)]
*  development, a lot of government investment. So, you know, it's a bit of a two-tail story here. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2751.12s)]
*  But on the resource-poor countries, this is the ultimate question. Who is going to get these [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2756.8s)]
*  countries out of the situation they're in? I mean, one looks at Egypt and Lebanon, which are on the [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2762.32s)]
*  brink of absolute collapse financially. And it's no longer, I think, the argument of the 1990s or [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2767.36s)]
*  early 2000s that we held so long, which was that the private sector was the engine of growth. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2774.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't see it. International investment, despite years of attracting and trying to put in the so [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2779.44s)]
*  called regulations to attract them to come invest in the region, have not panned out. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2787.1200000000003s)]
*  Domestic investors, the private sector itself, increasingly does not want to compete in the case [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2792.64s)]
*  of Egypt in particular with the state itself, right? The state is crowding out all business [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2798.32s)]
*  investments. So it is a bit of a scary situation in that other than what we often hear from, [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2803.76s)]
*  you know, the World Bank and the IMF and others is the wonderful story of the entrepreneur. I mean, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2810.24s)]
*  what a wonderful catch-all phrase for everything to say that the impetus is really on the [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2815.84s)]
*  individual to get them out of this doldrum, which is a lot of pressure on individuals and small, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2822.32s)]
*  medium-sized enterprises. But that really is the only sort of optimism one sees is this, oh, well, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2827.76s)]
*  the entrepreneurial spirit is strong in the Middle East. I know Carnegie and others have done an [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2835.1200000000003s)]
*  Atlantic Council and others have done such great work on this. And I agree, but it's not enough. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2839.04s)]
*  It's not enough to compete with the enormous state investment that is being seen to happen across [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2844.48s)]
*  the developing and emerging market economies. And there just isn't those national champions [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2850.96s)]
*  throughout the Middle East, particularly in the resource-poor countries that are successful [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2855.84s)]
*  at really getting the region out of its economic situation. So that's why I think I'm pessimistic, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2860.08s)]
*  but I think asking the really important question of what is the engine of growth and, you know, [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2865.52s)]
*  China and India and all of these other populist nationalist states are leaning on, [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2871.12s)]
*  you know, state champions and the state to really be the spur of investment and growth. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2876.4s)]
*  You can't say the same thing for resource-poor countries, which I think is really the challenge [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2881.44s)]
*  in the Middle East, personally. Great. Thank you. Anyone else? Dalia? Yeah. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2885.3599999999997s)]
*  Thank you. Yeah. Well, thanks. I love these questions. Zooming out again, I'll just kind [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2895.52s)]
*  of take my portfolio or portfolio Fred and I covered. I love the question of asking who's [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2902.16s)]
*  listening and who should we be trying to influence? And I would look at it on two levels. One, I think [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2908.48s)]
*  is regional leadership for put aside the word state, but I think, you know, there is promise [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2914.32s)]
*  in this interest in or understanding that these regional adventures have been too costly [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2921.2799999999997s)]
*  and we need to start focusing on some things at home. But I think where, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2928.08s)]
*  what we need to focus on is getting to a point where leaders understand and believe it's in [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2931.9199999999996s)]
*  their self-interest, not just to do these mega state projects, but that actually transnational [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2938.48s)]
*  threats are existential for them as well. And that these deescalations, if they can lead to something [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2944.0s)]
*  that's more sustainable and working on another project, looking at how we institutionalize some [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2950.64s)]
*  of this cooperation regionally, I think that's what we need to be moving toward as a vision. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2955.52s)]
*  And then I think, of course, in terms of US policymakers, we're kind of here in Washington, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2960.96s)]
*  at least Carnegie is, and on two sides there, I think one is to the administration, but not just [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2966.48s)]
*  this administration, many before it, kind of playing, as you mentioned, Lisa, the same playbook, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2975.36s)]
*  right? Everything is about partnerships and we're losing sight of what are these partnerships for, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2980.8s)]
*  right? So in other work I've done and others in this group have done, there needs to be more [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2986.48s)]
*  focused on what are we trying to deliver? And so I think if we move from that state prism to a [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2991.52s)]
*  people prism, right, who are we delivering for? And it's for people in this region. And if we [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=2997.44s)]
*  don't do it from a, you know, a principled-based perspective, then at least from a self-interest, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3002.48s)]
*  because if you don't deal with these problems, they will come back to us. And that's the second [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3008.48s)]
*  audience I think that's important in Washington, which is a growing audience, not quite as [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3013.92s)]
*  influential as the establishment, quote unquote. But there is a growing group of so-called [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3017.92s)]
*  restrainers. And there is this sense of let's wash our hands of this region. They're taking things, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3024.16s)]
*  they're taking care of things themselves. What do we have to worry about? We have limited [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3029.92s)]
*  interest. That's great. One, putting aside the moral and principled concerns I would have about [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3034.8s)]
*  those arguments, again, from a self-interest perspective, that's not going to happen. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3040.64s)]
*  That's not how the world works. And it will come back to us. And so we need to figure out [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3045.2000000000003s)]
*  smarter ways of engaging. This is not going back to kind of the Iraq projects that we know have [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3050.64s)]
*  failed from the past couple decades. It's working with partners, working with people, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3055.84s)]
*  working with civil society, working with business, and trying to figure out how we can be part of [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3060.88s)]
*  that project with partners, but not for its own sake, but to deliver something to people in this [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3066.08s)]
*  region. Just to kind of build on that, I think that's exactly right. I mean, certainly what we [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3072.56s)]
*  are seeing in the surveys we've done is just we've never seen things like this before the Arab [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3078.32s)]
*  uprisings, after the Arab uprisings. We have people who are just suffering to such an extent, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3082.08s)]
*  and Lebanon's not the only case. I mean, at this point, we have the Egyptian authorities telling [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3087.7599999999998s)]
*  people to eat chicken feet for protein. There's suggestions of donkey and horse meat. It's just, [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3091.44s)]
*  these are countries that are not used to this type of situation. And I think that the populations [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3095.92s)]
*  aren't willing to continue accepting that. Will they necessarily, what will the changes be? I [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3100.56s)]
*  think that's yet to be seen. I'm in some way surprised we haven't seen more kind of unrest. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3105.36s)]
*  Maybe that's some of the, again, the repressive mechanisms of state that have been talked about [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3109.44s)]
*  here that are limiting that. But even, for example, right now, we've seen that for a long [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3113.28s)]
*  time, the kind of Islamist ideology was relatively lowly supported across the region. We've seen the [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3118.8s)]
*  last four or five years, an increase in that for the first time in over a decade. But there are [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3123.6s)]
*  people looking for alternatives. And not to say that's necessarily the only alternative, not to [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3128.88s)]
*  say that's necessarily going to come back is kind of the force it was before. But there is at least [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3132.32s)]
*  a sense that people are looking for an alternative. That the states, as Lisa was saying, [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3136.64s)]
*  is that there's been a change there. The publics are looking for something else. This model isn't [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3141.52s)]
*  working. They know that. And if they can find something else that offers that opportunity, [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3145.3599999999997s)]
*  it seems very likely that the public opinion will move in that direction. Because there isn't a [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3149.2799999999997s)]
*  solution. But if someone offers that, we saw that in Tunisia briefly, when a populace comes to power, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3153.68s)]
*  offers a kind of at least hope. There is huge support for that. That's fallen away now. But [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3158.96s)]
*  again, some of these actors will come up. And certainly that will change the dynamics of the [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3164.08s)]
*  region, as Dali was saying. And so I do think that there is a real need to focus on this. And the [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3167.6s)]
*  region won't go away with what we're seeing there. If I could jump here, I would say that if we look [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3172.88s)]
*  at the region from the 70s up to Arab Spring, the Arab states, basically Saudi Arabia or Egypt, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3182.64s)]
*  the main cases that we discuss in our paper, they have this formula that authoritarian [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3188.16s)]
*  ritualism, Islamism, and America. And these three aspects are what makes their relationship [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3195.12s)]
*  to the population and their ability to manage their resources and to govern and to maintain [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3204.96s)]
*  themselves regionally. After Arab Spring, all these three pillars got challenged. Islamism [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3211.04s)]
*  are being rolled back. And it is replaced by different types of nationalism. States are trying [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3218.64s)]
*  to push for some kind of a cosmopolitan, neoliberal national subject that can be competitive in global [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3224.96s)]
*  markets, but politically quiet and non-active. But at the same time, population are responding [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3233.84s)]
*  back to a kind of a nationalism that it is fascist and anti-xenophobic and et cetera. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3241.04s)]
*  And with regard to regional aspect, there are new thinking about the rule of America and the region [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3247.84s)]
*  and countries and states, basically these kind of states. They thinking that in the same way that [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3252.6400000000003s)]
*  we are moving away from oil, diversify our economy, we want to diversify our political [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3261.2s)]
*  relationships and political partnerships. That doesn't mean that we are moving away from America, [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3265.6s)]
*  but that means we want to diversify our relationship. We have better relationship with [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3270.08s)]
*  Russia, with better relationship with China in a way that would compensate with the lack of trust [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3273.8399999999997s)]
*  with America's rule in the region, especially after Arab Spring and competition between Saudi [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3282.0s)]
*  Arabia and Iran. With aspect with the state itself, I see it's true what Lisa said in terms [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3290.08s)]
*  of many countries in the region, the state has decayed. It became weak in terms of its ability [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3298.16s)]
*  to have a monopoly over the use of violence, its ability to provide services, to ability to conduct [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3303.36s)]
*  basic functions of a state. But in countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, we see an increasing [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3308.96s)]
*  monopoly of violence, ability to conduct policies in a way that become more extractive [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3315.6s)]
*  in terms that they want to extract resources from their population, from their private markets, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3325.6s)]
*  and they want their population to fight for them in their wars, etc. That is making the state more [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3330.08s)]
*  state if we can say it in that regard. Thank you very much. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3337.92s)]
*  Super great points, Sultan, and appreciate you bringing in this new sort of ruling bargain, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3342.5600000000004s)]
*  this construct that you described of political liberalism, so-called social tolerance, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3348.1600000000003s)]
*  economic competitiveness, and this sort of new nationalism that's springing forward. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3354.8s)]
*  We've got one question from the audience. If you could answer it briefly, Sultan, and I think it [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3359.5200000000004s)]
*  echoes a lot of the points that you raised. It's actually on the neon, the smart city, and it's [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3364.4s)]
*  this question is referring back to the title of our collection. Do you see the neon project as [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3371.44s)]
*  an evidence of Arab dynamism, or is it disruptive or distracting? Sultan? [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3377.28s)]
*  I would say in Silicon Valley terminology, disruptive is a good thing. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3385.04s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3390.8s)]
*  So it's disruptive in this both senses. It's disruptive in terms of how they think of building [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3391.84s)]
*  new cities, and it's disruptive in terms of their impact regionally and economically. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3397.6s)]
*  So I would say that this project would require a lot of resources. The state itself [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3404.3199999999997s)]
*  promising that the money will not come from the state, it will come from foreign investment. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3412.3199999999997s)]
*  We're not seeing that coming yet. So if it ends up being done, and I think it is the main project [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3415.92s)]
*  that the government in Saudi Arabia thinks that it's on pyramids, it's on signature [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3424.4s)]
*  and that would require a lot of opportunity cost in terms of funnelling and channeling most of the [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3434.88s)]
*  resources of the country into this project. Whether it is designed for the Saudi people, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3442.1600000000003s)]
*  it is explicit that we've seen some leaks that this piece of land where New York would be based [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3449.6000000000004s)]
*  on, it will be some kind of has an autonomy in terms of its laws and its government that it [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3457.1200000000003s)]
*  will be governed by companies. It will be people there will be called new humans. Some officials [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3463.04s)]
*  and New York have some leaks about what they would call. And that is, it is a neoliberal [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3470.48s)]
*  utopia. People in Silicon Valley and other places would think of this kind of relationship [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3480.56s)]
*  between government and state is optimal. It's desired and it is catered to this kind of audiences. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3486.56s)]
*  But yeah, those are great points. And again, we could talk, I could listen to you forever on this, [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3493.12s)]
*  you've really encapsulated a lot of the important points on Saudi Arabia, but also the broader [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3500.1600000000003s)]
*  themes of the discussion we have run out of time. But I think you've raised circled us back to this [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3505.5200000000004s)]
*  important point of statehood. And what does it mean to belong to these states that Lisa raised? [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3510.0800000000004s)]
*  We have certainly not ended the conversation completely. I think there's a lot more to discuss. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3517.44s)]
*  I want to thank all of our four panelists for a really rich and illuminating discussion. I want [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3523.2s)]
*  to thank especially our discussant Lisa for really raising some issues for follow on study and [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3530.3199999999997s)]
*  inquiry. Thanks to our audience for joining us and for the question. And again, you can access [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3536.16s)]
*  the entire volume disruptions and dynamism in the Arab world on Carnegie's website. So again, [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3542.72s)]
*  my apologies for cutting the conversation short, but we are out of time. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3549.68s)]
*  Thank you again and goodbye from Washington. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tJMlEzNiok&t=3554.24s)]
