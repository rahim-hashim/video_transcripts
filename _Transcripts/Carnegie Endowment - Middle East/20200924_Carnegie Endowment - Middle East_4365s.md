Video Description: The U.S. administration that takes office in January 2021 will formulate policies toward the Middle East and North Africa amid rising great power competition, a shifting energy landscape, and a diminished public appetite for military interventions. What lessons can be learned from the experiences of the two previous administrations? "Re-Engaging the Middle East," a new book of essays edited by Dafna Rand and Andrew Miller, takes up this question across a range of countries and thematic issues.

Join us on Thursday, September 24, for a panel discussion that will bring together former Obama and Trump administration officials alongside experts from the MENA region. Together, they will take a critical look at U.S. policies under both presidents with a view toward recommendations for the next administration.

*  And we will have to, we will try to have a self-critical look at policies that were implemented [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=31.36s)]
*  during our distinguished speakers' times in the administrations, what went wrong, what [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=38.36s)]
*  was right, and what policies we need to implement to move forward. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=45.32s)]
*  The occasion for this event is the release of a book of essays, Re-engaging the Middle [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=52.32s)]

*  interests in the Middle East. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=67.88s)]
*  It calls for a new post-Obama and post-Trump approach to the region and critiques elements [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=69.98s)]
*  of both previous administrations' foreign policy efforts. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=75.74000000000001s)]

*  region. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=161.44s)]
*  Joyce Karam is a Washington correspondent for the national, has covered American politics [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=162.44s)]

*  With that, let me turn to you, Daphne, as editor of the book and ask you the first question, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=226.12s)]
*  which is on everybody's mind. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=235.2s)]
*  If VP Biden wins the election, what do you think should be the main differences between [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=237.0s)]
*  his new administration's policies on the Middle East and President Obama's policy? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=242.98000000000002s)]
*  You served under President Obama. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=248.06s)]
*  Would you advise him to keep the same policies or would you advise him to do things differently? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=250.8s)]
*  Thank you, Marwan, and thank you to you and Michelle Dunn and the staff of the Carnegie [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=259.58000000000004s)]
*  Endowment for holding this event and for helping us to publish, publicize our book. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=268.1s)]
*  I want to thank all of the authors of this book, a very remarkable group of mostly former [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=273.06s)]
*  public servants and new generation of writers and thinkers on the Middle East for helping [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=277.62s)]
*  us bring this to fruition. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=282.02000000000004s)]
*  Last year's question, Marwan, about the comparison, time does not stop in the region for U.S. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=285.18s)]
*  politics. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=290.78000000000003s)]
*  It is very hard to compare the situation of 2020 or 2021 to the end of the Obama administration, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=291.78000000000003s)]
*  2016. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=298.54s)]
*  So the comparison would be misleading. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=299.54s)]
*  The region is dealing with COVID, as everyone knows, on top of three enduring civil conflicts [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=301.94s)]
*  and the rise of an emerging geopolitical order of sorts, with the strong Sunni Arab law quietly [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=308.02000000000004s)]
*  working with Israel. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=313.82s)]
*  And on top of these dynamics, we have some similarities and commonalities with earlier [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=315.42s)]
*  eras. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=319.18s)]
*  We have young people and average citizens around the region legitimately frustrated [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=320.18s)]
*  with continued corrupt governance systems. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=324.74s)]
*  And as the case of Lebanon suggests, the very ruptured contracts between state and society [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=327.78000000000003s)]
*  that literally can become a tinderbox. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=332.54s)]
*  Biden has said, Vice President Biden has said again and again that we must not be arrogant [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=335.62s)]
*  enough to think that we, the United States, has all the answers or can dictate the outcomes [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=340.22s)]
*  in such complex societies. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=346.18s)]
*  And that is the main theme of his approach to the Middle East. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=347.90000000000003s)]
*  Yet, he also deeply believes as a world-leading democracy, as part and parcel of American [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=351.70000000000005s)]
*  power, the United States has a responsibility to uphold liberties and human rights around [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=357.58000000000004s)]
*  the world. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=362.18s)]
*  So when you ask about a Biden administration, I do believe that the Vice President Biden, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=363.34000000000003s)]
*  elected, will not shy away from condemning the violation of universal rights and publicly [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=367.94s)]
*  supporting economic and political reform. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=373.14s)]
*  It will be very different from President Trump, who excuses away Saudi abuses and calls Egypt's [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=376.7s)]
*  leaders my favorite dictator, dictators. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=381.82s)]
*  But more practically, I can see a Biden administration supporting civil society in the region, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=385.3s)]
*  which has been squeezed significantly by both the conflicts and the rise of authoritarianism [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=389.94s)]
*  and a renewed emphasis in a Biden administration on supporting democratic allies in the Arab [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=395.26s)]
*  world, such as Tunisia. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=399.94s)]
*  And finally, Vice President Biden, who has worked in foreign policy for over three decades, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=401.46s)]
*  has strategic patience and he will bring the strategic patience to his US foreign policy [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=406.82s)]
*  approach to the region. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=412.09999999999997s)]
*  He will work to rejoin an Iran deal only if Iran is in compliance, but also sees the threat [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=413.09999999999997s)]
*  from Iran as a larger problem set than just the nuclear problem. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=419.61999999999995s)]
*  There are so many areas that he will work on to try to tamp down Iranian activities in [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=424.41999999999996s)]
*  the region and again, will have a long term perspective to this problem. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=428.09999999999997s)]
*  You did not mention the Arab-Israeli conflict, but we will get to that, Daphna, in a short [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=433.85999999999996s)]
*  while. Let me turn it over to you, Mick. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=439.29999999999995s)]
*  If President Trump wins the election, what do you think should be the main changes that [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=442.14s)]
*  should be made to Middle East policies in his second term? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=447.97999999999996s)]
*  Not what he would do necessarily, but what you think he should do. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=450.70000000000005s)]
*  I'm glad you asked it that way, Marwan. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=456.18s)]
*  So I'd like to start by just pointing out that I spent about 99 percent of my career in [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=458.14000000000004s)]
*  operations and only about the last, obviously, one percent in policy. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=463.42s)]
*  So I am an apolitical person, and that's how I'm going to view most of my answers, both [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=467.86s)]
*  what we did in the last four years, what was right, what was wrong, and then and then my [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=474.34000000000003s)]
*  suggestions for what whoever the president is for the next four years should be doing. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=479.7s)]
*  So I think I think one of the big things and it's already already been mentioned by Daphna [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=486.34s)]
*  is to attempt to get back on the diplomatic path back into the JCPOA and that it was a [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=490.86s)]
*  mistake to have left it. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=499.78s)]
*  Over the Pentagon, we talk often about the fact it wasn't the perfect agreement. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=503.3s)]
*  I don't think you will get a perfect agreement. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=507.5s)]
*  If that's if that's the standard, then it's unattainable. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=509.94s)]
*  But the former agreement did limit their nuclear ambitions. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=514.14s)]
*  And I think that was an important point. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=518.86s)]
*  We do need to address their malign activities, both their ballistic missile program and their [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=521.7s)]
*  use of proxy forces. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=527.54s)]
*  But that can be addressed in a new or simply getting back to the old 2015 nuclear agreement. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=530.26s)]
*  So I think that is one thing that we that we, regardless of the administration, whose [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=538.82s)]
*  administration it is, should look at doing. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=545.74s)]
*  Right now, it appears that the maximum pressure campaign has simply pushed them toward more [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=547.82s)]
*  malign activity and toward exceeding the limits that were placed on them. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=553.86s)]
*  By the 2015 agreement. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=559.46s)]
*  Another point I'd like to make that we should we should do in the next administration is [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=561.82s)]
*  related to Syria. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=568.98s)]
*  So it was a success when the US and our coalition partners, particularly the Syrian Defense [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=570.58s)]
*  Forces, beat the so-called caliphate. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=577.34s)]
*  And I think that's something the world can be can be appreciative for. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=581.94s)]
*  The idea to precipitously withdraw was a mistake. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=586.74s)]
*  We need to double down on our efforts there. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=590.42s)]
*  We need to support the partners that supported us. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=594.14s)]
*  And we need to turn on and probably increase the stabilization efforts in the liberated [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=597.02s)]
*  regions. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=603.46s)]
*  That's something hopefully we can get into more discussions on. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=604.9s)]
*  But when it comes to these this type of warfare, Syria was in many ways a model, a very limited [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=608.38s)]
*  US presence, a very competent partner, and I think pretty substantial outcomes in the [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=615.46s)]
*  positive light. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=622.7s)]
*  What we need to do is focus on on what the military calls phase four, but when most of [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=624.14s)]
*  us called stabilizations of places like that, so that it isn't an endless cycle of conflict. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=629.86s)]
*  On the Middle East peace process, I can tell you up front, I was I was not an expert and I [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=636.94s)]
*  still not an expert on on that process, partly because in the last four years, there was very [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=641.58s)]
*  limited participation in that. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=648.66s)]
*  So the Defense Department played next to no part in developing the plan. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=650.98s)]
*  I think going ahead, that should be a much more comprehensive effort, interagency venture. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=657.74s)]
*  And I know we'll probably talk more of that. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=665.46s)]
*  I would like to again highlight what Daphna said on the universal rights. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=667.9s)]
*  That's that's something that the United States needs to be the leader on. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=672.06s)]
*  I don't think we've done a very good job on that in the last four years. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=676.2199999999999s)]
*  And whoever's in administration needs to go back to being the leader of the free world, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=679.66s)]
*  actually being something that matters. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=684.78s)]
*  And the last point I'd make when it comes to things that we need to ensure happen is that our [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=687.8199999999999s)]
*  diplomats need to be back in the lead for U.S. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=694.78s)]
*  foreign policy in the Middle East. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=698.22s)]
*  I think I think we've done a disservice by reducing their impact and influence in general. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=702.6999999999999s)]
*  And I think we need to ensure that when it comes to the military and the intelligence [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=709.86s)]
*  community, both of which I am from, is a supporting effort to the overall State Department [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=714.66s)]
*  and diplomatic lead when it comes to our foreign engagements. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=720.5799999999999s)]
*  Now, stop there. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=724.54s)]
*  Thank you, Mick. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=726.22s)]
*  Alex, Mick mentioned the Trump administration's policies on Syria. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=728.3000000000001s)]
*  You worked on Syria during the Obama administration. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=734.22s)]
*  And many people think that the tragedy that has unfolded in Syria was a failure not just [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=737.5s)]
*  for the Trump administration, but for the Obama administration as well. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=743.78s)]
*  How can the next administration engage with Syria, whether it is Republican or [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=748.22s)]
*  Democrat, to contribute to the welfare of the Syrian people in a much better way than [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=753.5s)]
*  what has been done already? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=758.86s)]
*  Thanks, Marwan. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=761.7s)]
*  And thank you to the Carnegie Endowment for the invitation to be part of the panel. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=762.5s)]
*  It's I think this is really a necessary conversation. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=765.74s)]
*  We spend a lot of time making on the fly recommendations and a lot of times criticizing [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=768.86s)]
*  people of another party or in another administration. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=775.78s)]
*  But to really reflect seriously on what we got wrong is part of learning and it's part of [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=778.46s)]
*  making better policy. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=782.3s)]
*  So I really applaud Carnegie for doing this and Daphne for putting together the volume [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=783.22s)]
*  that stimulated it. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=788.0600000000001s)]
*  So I actually agree quite strongly with what's already been said, what Mick said about Syria [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=790.1s)]
*  policy in the Trump administration. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=796.02s)]
*  I'd like to go back a little bit to the Obama period and I will answer your question about [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=798.34s)]
*  what we should do now. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=802.86s)]
*  But I think it is first worth reflecting on some of the things that we got right and some [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=803.6600000000001s)]
*  of the things that we got wrong. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=807.82s)]
*  I think if you if you talk to anybody who worked on Syria policy in the Obama administration [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=809.7800000000001s)]
*  from the desk officers up to the secretary of state and the president, everybody tells [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=813.94s)]
*  you that this was an outcome which failed the Syrian people and that all of us think [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=819.1400000000001s)]
*  about and will continue to think about probably for the rest of our lives. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=824.7s)]
*  And so I think the Syrian people deserved better and we all recognize that. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=828.9000000000001s)]
*  But I'd also like to point out that the conflict in Syria was it was and remains extraordinarily [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=834.18s)]
*  complex, not just because of the intricacies of the internal dynamics, but it makes me [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=841.34s)]
*  think in a way of the Spanish Civil War, a moment where the balance of power in the world [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=845.74s)]
*  was changing, where regional actors became involved in a domestic conflict and tried [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=850.7s)]
*  to take the measure of their own strength. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=856.42s)]
*  And I think Syria in that way refracts a number of the things that are taking place across [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=857.94s)]
*  the region more generally and internationally. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=862.18s)]
*  So if you thought that I don't think anybody comes out looking good, if you thought as [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=864.66s)]
*  many people thought during the first episodes of the conflict, if you thought that the United [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=870.5s)]
*  States didn't have major interests in Syria and therefore could stay on the sidelines, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=876.02s)]
*  the spillover and effects on regional stability, the growth of ISIS, the refugee crisis in [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=882.18s)]
*  Europe, Russia's enhanced role, all of these things, I think, have shown fairly clearly that [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=889.1s)]
*  Syria did not stay in Syria and that it ultimately did impact U.S. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=894.86s)]
*  interest. If conversely, you thought that the United States should have taken a more [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=897.86s)]
*  decisive role in pushing the Assad government to negotiate its own demise, I think you have [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=902.62s)]
*  to reckon with the fact that after nine years and various different kinds of pressure, the [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=908.66s)]
*  Syrian government has made almost no concessions on any political question at all of even the [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=914.1800000000001s)]
*  smallest kind. So I think there's a little humility that's necessary there. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=917.98s)]
*  My own view on what we got right and wrong, I believe the president made the right decision [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=922.94s)]
*  in not getting the United States involved in another ground war. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=928.22s)]
*  I think that was part of his electoral mandate. I think it was the right choice strategically [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=931.02s)]
*  for the United States. But we made a number of assumptions, or I should say the administration [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=934.62s)]
*  made a number of assumptions over the course of the war that proved wrong. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=938.0600000000001s)]
*  And I'll highlight three of those and then I'll, as I said, answer your question, I promise. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=942.86s)]
*  The first is I think there was a sense that the administration could speak without acting. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=947.74s)]
*  The phrase Assad must go is understandable in retrospect. I think it was understandable [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=953.9s)]
*  at the time given what Assad was doing to his people and given also the intelligence assessments [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=958.38s)]
*  of his likely future. But it really boxed us in diplomatically. It made the conflict [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=964.3s)]
*  existential. If it wasn't already, it made the conflict existential for the Syrian government. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=970.22s)]
*  And I think it put Russia in a reactive position, which made them more inclined to act in ways that [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=974.22s)]
*  undermine U.S. interests. Secondly, I think we made the assumption that the conflict in Syria could [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=978.94s)]
*  be contained. And here I don't mean just in a blanket sense. I think we were wrong even about [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=984.5400000000001s)]
*  where the spillover would be. There was a lot of attention, as Daphna will probably remember, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=989.82s)]
*  and Nick may also, a lot of attention devoted to thinking about spillover to Jordan and Lebanon, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=994.5400000000001s)]
*  and an assumption that Turkey, because of its robust military, would be able to withstand the [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=999.34s)]
*  effects of the Syrian war. Almost no thought was devoted to Iraq, which in fact nearly collapsed [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1003.02s)]
*  in 2014. And as we can see today, although Jordan and Lebanon remain, I think, fragile, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1007.66s)]
*  they've weathered the storm better than anticipated, whereas Turkey is embroiled across its border in a [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1014.38s)]
*  conflict with no real clear sense of how that ends. And then the third assumption I think we [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1019.74s)]
*  really got wrong was to assume that Russia's bet would be a losing one. And I'm not in the camp that [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1025.26s)]
*  thinks that Russia is 10 feet tall, that Russia has displaced the United States from the Middle [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1032.06s)]
*  East. I think that's vastly overblown. But Russia has demonstrated that they can prop up a client. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1036.1399999999999s)]
*  They have thickened their cooperation and relationship with Turkey. They've made Israel [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1042.54s)]
*  to some extent dependent on Russia for its own security. And they have established a military [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1048.06s)]
*  presence in Syria, but now likely also in Libya and Egypt that have bounced off the back of what [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1054.22s)]
*  they did in Syria. And I think we failed to anticipate that kind of geopolitical [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1061.26s)]
*  outcome of what Russia did in Syria. So I won't repeat what Mick said about [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1066.7s)]
*  the Trump administration. I agree with him. I think the capricious treatment of US military [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1073.5s)]
*  forces in the Northeast, the kind of rapid withdrawal on two occasions, I think it left [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1079.9s)]
*  our partners hanging. I think it encouraged those who oppose our presence, and that's a long list, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1084.3799999999999s)]
*  to test our resolve in ways that are ultimately very dangerous. And I think also that it left [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1091.18s)]
*  us with a very unclear mandate. I don't believe personally the United States should be in the [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1097.0200000000002s)]
*  Middle East to protect oil. I think that's not only is that contravening international law, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1100.7800000000002s)]
*  it's also a bad, it reinforces some of the worst instincts, I think, of people's assumptions about [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1105.5s)]
*  how the United States makes its decisions. And then an element that Mick didn't highlight, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1109.9s)]
*  but I think is critically important, is that over the course of the Trump administration, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1115.82s)]
*  there's been a rapid ratcheting up of sanctions without a connection to a clear and achievable [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1120.3799999999999s)]
*  set of diplomatic goals. And the consequence has been to contribute to, not to create the [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1126.54s)]
*  humanitarian crisis, but to contribute meaningfully to the humanitarian crisis without getting, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1132.22s)]
*  as I said, any progress on the political front. I think that's a balance that needs to be rethought [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1136.46s)]
*  fundamentally. So you asked, what should we do? This is the perennial question, and I would offer [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1140.22s)]
*  the following kind of framework for thinking about how the U.S. could move forward in the future. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1146.78s)]
*  And this would be under either administration. I think firstly, because I think this conflict [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1150.78s)]
*  is going to go on for some time, because I think the lines have essentially frozen, they may be [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1155.82s)]
*  readjusted, but this is moving from an active war to a frozen conflict. And because the government [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1160.06s)]
*  is so reluctant to negotiate, I think this is a long-term game. And I think first of all, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1165.1799999999998s)]
*  that means we have to continue the humanitarian assistance, particularly for refugees, because I [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1171.4199999999998s)]
*  think many of those refugees aren't going home soon. Secondly, I think we have to recalibrate [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1175.4199999999998s)]
*  U.S. diplomacy so that we're a little closer to our European allies and we make a set of demands [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1179.98s)]
*  on Russia, which is unified and which is a little bit more realistic. So I would put on that list [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1185.34s)]
*  a halt to the military offenses, decentralization of authority, and creating an environment where [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1191.8999999999999s)]
*  citizens aren't being arrested and detained and where some refugees can go home. That's still [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1197.58s)]
*  ambitious, but it's a much less ambitious framework than we have in place right now. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1202.62s)]
*  And then finally, I would indicate that U.S. forces will remain in Syria, but I would attach [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1207.82s)]
*  that to a framework for protecting those people with whom we've worked in the Northeast [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1214.22s)]
*  and creating a framework, in other words, for the Northeast to be integrated into Syria in a [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1221.42s)]
*  meaningful and positive way. So I think we should say we're staying, but I think also the [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1225.1000000000001s)]
*  conditionality should not be based on Assad's removal or Iran leaving the country. It should [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1230.22s)]
*  be based on something much more concrete for the Northeast. This is unsatisfying, but I think it's [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1235.18s)]
*  the best we can do. Joyce, you are the only one from this panel from the Middle East. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1239.74s)]
*  What is your reaction to what you are hearing from the three speakers? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1249.9s)]
*  Do the lessons that they take away from the Obama and Trump policies resonate with you, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1256.14s)]
*  or would you take away different lessons? Well, good morning. Great to be with you, Marwan. I [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1260.78s)]
*  have to say you're the only one in the Middle East at the moment, so you have the best eye view [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1266.86s)]
*  of what's going on. Congrats, Daphna, on the new book. I very much enjoyed going through it, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1272.3s)]
*  very incisive on some of the criticism to both administrations. I do think, I do agree with Alex, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1281.9799999999998s)]
*  that there has to be a sense of humility for whoever comes to office in January. The U.S. of [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1289.34s)]
*  2012, the U.S. of 2016, the leverage that the U.S. had in the region is very much constrained today. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1298.06s)]
*  And if you look on the ground, the next president will inherit a very different region. So in a way, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1306.4599999999998s)]
*  the old playbook, whether it's Obama-Biden or Trump-Pence, is not going to be fully applicable. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1312.38s)]
*  I mean, you look at the region today, Omar al-Bashir is gone, overthrown. The U.S. did not have [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1319.98s)]
*  much to do with that. You have Bouteflika and Sultan Qaboos passed away. We see Bashar al-Assad [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1327.42s)]
*  in Syria has emerged stronger. Erdogan in Turkey and Sisi in Egypt are very much defiant and closer [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1336.22s)]
*  to Russia. As we saw last week, you see UAE, Bahrain, and Israel are normalizing relations. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1345.26s)]
*  And Saudi Arabia, MBS, has solidified power. Iran, as much as I appreciate the points on the [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1353.98s)]
*  JCPOA, actually now has Iranian enrichment 10 times than the JCPOA allowed. We're seeing protests [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1363.5s)]
*  in Lebanon and Iraq continue. And you also see outside strong powers such as China making [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1376.06s)]
*  significant inroads in the MENA region. So in that sense, I think there should be a fresh examination [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1383.98s)]
*  to what is happening in the Middle East. There is also, you know, when you talk to people in the [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1393.98s)]
*  region, there has to be a consistent approach. So if a President Biden opts to return to the Iran [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1401.98s)]
*  deal, it should be done in a bipartisan fashion. Because what we saw as going from, you know, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1411.42s)]
*  the JCPOA and the signing and everything to the next president just walking away [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1421.26s)]
*  from it, that just raises so much question marks over commitments that the U.S. makes abroad. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1429.02s)]
*  And I'm not pointing blame here at either Obama or Trump. It's just if you're going to put out a [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1436.78s)]
*  policy, maybe it's a good idea to have congressional support as a starting point. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1444.22s)]
*  Also on some points that, you know, the Biden approach, we still don't know [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1451.82s)]
*  much about his actual foreign policy in the region. I mean, the former Vice President is seen [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1458.22s)]
*  in parts of the Middle East as somebody who embraces sectarian politics. And that's a red flag [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1466.94s)]
*  for many people in the region. I mean, as a senator, he advocated for dividing Iraq into [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1474.22s)]
*  Sunni, Shia, and Kurdish federal areas. The region is in a very different place. And it would be, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1482.14s)]
*  you know, it would be wise for anybody who steps into office to come with a sense of humility, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1493.5s)]
*  as Alex mentioned, and examine these new changes in the region. You also have, you know, things [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1499.9s)]
*  that are happening on the ground in the Middle East that are very important. You know, activists [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1509.42s)]
*  are being gunned down in Iraq as the Trump administration hosts the prime minister. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1517.98s)]
*  So maybe pay more attention to the people of the Middle East, to those who are jailed in Egypt and [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1526.6200000000001s)]
*  Iran and Turkey and other places. So this is my, I think, contribution to where I see things. And [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1537.5s)]
*  we will see what happens here on the election and whether we actually have a [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1547.34s)]
*  peaceful transfer of power come January. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1551.4199999999998s)]
*  It's interesting that all of you mentioned the issue of human rights, which leads me to [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1557.74s)]
*  a provocative question for Dafna. The book, Dan Shapiro writes a chapter on the Arab-Israeli [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1565.02s)]
*  conflict in the book, Dafna, and he argues that the two-state solution is still possible. Is it? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1574.54s)]
*  Is the question, is a two-state solution still possible? And isn't the United States actually [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1580.86s)]
*  contributing to the death of the two-state solution by voicing passive support for it without actually [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1588.3799999999999s)]
*  a clear path towards its attainment? And the more provocative question, Dafna, is if a two-state [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1595.82s)]
*  solution becomes impossible, if indeed, whether it is the Trump plan, whether it's annexation, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1603.5s)]
*  if a two-state solution becomes impossible, and if Palestinians start asking for equal rights [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1611.02s)]
*  in the areas they live in under Israel's control, as it would be the probably best choice for them [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1617.82s)]
*  if they cannot have their own state, would a Biden presidency support equal rights for the Palestinians [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1625.6599999999999s)]
*  under occupation? Thanks, Marwan. We can always rely on you for the hard questions, and thank you [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1632.3799999999999s)]
*  also to the other speakers. In this book, we as the editors wanted each of the authors to articulate [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1639.02s)]
*  their vision for their chapter, and Ambassador Shapiro makes a compelling case for two points. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1645.74s)]
*  One, the two-state solution is still eventually possible with an emphasis on eventually, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1653.18s)]
*  but the time is not ripe currently given the leadership and the Israelis and Palestinian [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1658.62s)]
*  leadership to begin negotiations right away. And I think that caveat is quite important, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1663.58s)]
*  and we make that point in the introduction as well. He also analyzes why a two-state solution [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1667.98s)]
*  is maybe the least bad option at this point, going through all the reasons why the other options on [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1676.54s)]
*  the table will perpetuate violence and conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1682.78s)]
*  And that, I think, is an important point. He also calls for the new administration to do a review of [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1688.22s)]
*  those other options, which I think is something that's never been done before, to really [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1692.3s)]
*  articulate the pros and cons of the alternatives to a two-state solution. So I commend the readers [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1696.3s)]
*  to look at that part of this chapter as well. There are a number of steps that immediately need [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1701.26s)]
*  to be done to signal that the United States is back as a fair arbiter and a negotiator, and those [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1706.06s)]
*  are laid out in the book, and they involve immediately reversing the very, very damaging [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1711.8999999999999s)]
*  Trump policies that have essentially diminished or eliminated U.S. bilateral relationship with [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1716.7s)]
*  the Palestinian people and leaders. And these include, of course, reopening a consulate in [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1722.7s)]
*  Jerusalem that is a diplomatic signal to the Palestinian leaders and people, trying to reopen [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1727.26s)]
*  the PLO office in D.C., and importantly, restarting the assistance programs that have been the [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1733.1000000000001s)]
*  foundation for over 20 years of U.S. assistance to the Palestinian people. Almost all of this money [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1739.1000000000001s)]
*  bypasses, actually, the Palestinian Authority and goes to other objectives. So point number one in [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1745.82s)]
*  this book is that the most important step is to reverse the damage that's been done to begin to [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1753.82s)]
*  move towards the viability of eventually having a two-state solution available. In terms of your [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1759.58s)]
*  really tough question about Palestinian rights, Biden has not articulated what the future holds [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1766.06s)]
*  in terms of his foreign policy on this issue. He has been very clear that he opposes unilateral [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1771.9s)]
*  measures. He has been very clear that he opposed the idea of annexation. He has been very clear on [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1777.66s)]
*  the record his opposition to expansion of settlements and to illegal seizure of lands. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1783.3400000000001s)]
*  So he has been very clear on some of the human rights issues regarding Palestinians. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1789.02s)]
*  I'm going to push back a bit on, even though I know you didn't write the chapter, but [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1793.5800000000002s)]
*  when you say eventually, you're assuming that the status quo is frozen and there will come a time [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1802.38s)]
*  when, you know, better administrations will pick up the slack and move ahead with a settlement. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1807.9s)]
*  But the status quo is not frozen and things are being changed on the ground on a daily basis. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1815.3400000000001s)]
*  Through annexation, through settlement activity. So it is not clear to many how eventually that is [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1823.5s)]
*  going to lead to a two-state solution if the status quo is not frozen is basically the, you know, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1832.7s)]
*  the main question on the future of the conflict. I understand the activities that you describe as [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1841.42s)]
*  trying to reverse some of the Trump policies regarding the Arab-Israeli conflict, but these [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1851.66s)]
*  remain within the realm of small steps. They don't really add up to an eventual settlement of the [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1857.66s)]
*  conflict and if so, will lead at some point in time to the question of equal rights, which is [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1866.46s)]
*  going to be a very difficult question to answer for any U.S. president. But I would like to ask [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1873.8200000000002s)]
*  this of President Biden since he has emphasized this issue of human rights. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1880.78s)]
*  Yes, and one other point that Ambassador Shapiro makes that others have articulated and encouraged, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1887.5s)]
*  especially during the Obama administration, there was a debate about this, but the United States has [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1893.18s)]
*  no administration has ever clearly laid out what the two-state solution looks like from a U.S. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1896.54s)]
*  perspective. And Ambassador Shapiro makes the recommendation, agree with it or not, in this book [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1901.34s)]
*  that the United States and the Biden or the next administration should actually articulate what a [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1906.06s)]
*  two-state solution looks like in the parameters of that. And I think that is a debatable and [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1910.54s)]
*  probably a recommendation that should be taken up. Okay, Mick, let me turn to security arrangements. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1917.5s)]
*  I mean, beyond military deployments, what do you see as the proper role of other forms of security [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1926.1399999999999s)]
*  engagement in the region? Security assistance relationships and arms sales in U.S. policies [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1932.06s)]
*  regarding the region in any administration that comes after January? [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1938.38s)]
*  Yeah, thanks Marwan for that question. So starting with security assistance, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1946.38s)]
*  and I'll just mention that for the Palestinians. And there's been several occasions where we've had [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1949.9s)]
*  debates on the continuation of security assistance. And what I'm thinking about right now is [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1957.1000000000001s)]
*  Lebanese armed forces. The argument on one side was we're losing to the Iranian influence, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1963.8200000000002s)]
*  let's cut our losses and stop the assistance. On the other side, which is the one I was on, was [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1973.26s)]
*  if it is not working effectively, let's determine what the problem is, continue our assistance and [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1979.5800000000002s)]
*  then maybe even improve it, if not increase it. And I think that is the way we ought to look at [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1985.98s)]
*  our systems in the region in general. If it's not working, why? If we need to improve it, then let's [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=1993.9s)]
*  do so. Let's not just cut our losses, so to speak, and withdraw from the region. Because at the end [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2003.42s)]
*  of the day, that's what our competitors want us to do. So in 2018, Secretary Mattis, the Defense [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2010.3s)]
*  Department did the National Defense Strategy, which identified our priorities and came up with [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2018.3799999999999s)]
*  a plan to meet them. This included neopure competitors of Russia and China. That's not just [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2025.5s)]
*  in the geographic region of Russia and China. That is everywhere. And I bring it up because [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2034.3799999999999s)]
*  the Middle East is where several of our competitors have chosen to compete. And we need to be able to [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2040.1399999999999s)]
*  compete with them. And part of that does come down to the Defense Department in line with and under [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2046.3s)]
*  the guidance of the diplomatic effort. So when our security assistance should be viewed in that way. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2051.8199999999997s)]
*  Arms sales is an interesting component of that. Generally speaking, it's within the province and [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2058.78s)]
*  the State Department. So immediately you would think, okay, that's the Defense Department, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2066.38s)]
*  because it's weapons systems and munitions. Generally, that is not. We've, I think, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2071.26s)]
*  leered toward just trying to sell arms systems. It needs to be directly connected with our overall [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2078.7s)]
*  strategic objectives in the region. If it is, then it should go forward. If it's not, then it should [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2085.1s)]
*  be heavily scrutinized. I think in the change of an administration, it will be. I think the [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2091.02s)]
*  relationship between Saudi Arabia and other Gulf partners will be reviewed. And we've said it [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2100.94s)]
*  several times on the issue of human rights. And that might change when it comes to the willingness [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2107.66s)]
*  to especially advance the arms systems to the region. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2115.1s)]
*  Alex, I want to stay on the military side angle. It is not unlikely that whatever [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2119.3399999999997s)]
*  next year's administration comes that it will scale back its military presence in the region [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2128.2999999999997s)]
*  and reevaluate its arm support functions. But of course, others like Iran or Syria are unlikely [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2134.06s)]
*  to halter destabilizing behavior in places like Syria or Yemen. How should the next administration [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2141.26s)]
*  contend with this reality? [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2147.5800000000004s)]
*  Thanks, Marwan. I think in many ways at a strategic level, that's kind of the core [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2151.98s)]
*  question the United States faces. The recognition that we've been overweight in the Middle East [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2156.5400000000004s)]
*  is not a new one, although I think it's a new one. But I think it's a new one. And I think [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2162.94s)]
*  it's not a new one, although I think it's gained steam among both Democrats and Republicans over [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2169.9s)]
*  the last several years. And there's a very good chapter that addresses it head on in the military [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2174.54s)]
*  sphere in the book. I guess I would say that there are two hard truths involved in that. One is [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2179.82s)]
*  a need to reduce because, and when I say reduce, I don't mean necessarily reduce the number of [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2188.94s)]
*  troops or reduce the number of bases necessarily. It's also a question of the attention of senior [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2195.34s)]
*  policymakers. And I think Mick and Daphne will agree with me on this. And I know, Marwan, from [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2199.66s)]
*  your own experience in government, senior politicians and senior officials have limited time. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2206.62s)]
*  And in the Obama administration, a huge amount of that time was devoted to thinking about the [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2212.8599999999997s)]
*  Middle East, even though there was a strong recognition that the competitor of the United [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2216.7799999999997s)]
*  States would face over the next 20, 50 years was going to be China. And so I think reallocating [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2221.02s)]
*  attention is as important as reallocating military assets. But there's two realities to this. One is [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2228.22s)]
*  we need to reduce. And the other is that that's going to also mean if you're going to try to do [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2235.8999999999996s)]
*  less, you're going to have to accept a little bit less. And that's a very, I think that comes across [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2243.02s)]
*  that gives you a sense of foreboding in Washington. It's very ominous. But I think it's just a reality. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2250.7799999999997s)]
*  You're going to have to decide less of what and you're going to have to decide what the United [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2256.14s)]
*  States simply can't accept. And I think there are two implications of this. Again, I think they sound [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2260.8599999999997s)]
*  ominous, but we have to begin to wrestle with them and think more clearly about them. The one is I [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2268.54s)]
*  think there's going to have to be a greater tolerance for some to some degree, a greater [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2272.54s)]
*  tolerance for a multipolar Middle East. And I don't think that I'm not suggesting the United States [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2276.46s)]
*  is going to abandon the region. We have a robust set of economic, military, political, diplomatic [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2281.26s)]
*  relationships in the region. That's not going to change. But it does mean there are going to be [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2288.3s)]
*  other actors there. That I think is beyond our control at this point, particularly with China, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2292.3s)]
*  but also with Russia. And so we're going to have to think about what that means. And before we take [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2296.2200000000003s)]
*  that as being a kind of terrifying prospect, I think it's important to remember that for the [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2301.42s)]
*  entire duration of the Cold War for the United States and the Middle East from the late 1950s [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2306.7s)]
*  until the early 1990s, that was the situation that we faced. It was a multipolar Middle East. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2311.3399999999997s)]
*  And that's a competition that we ultimately won and won quite handily. And I think some of the [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2316.46s)]
*  advantages that we have then are advantages that we continue to have today, particularly vis-a-vis [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2321.74s)]
*  Russia, but also vis-a-vis China. And the second, which is I think perhaps equally controversial, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2326.22s)]
*  if not more so, is we have to think differently about conflicts. And this gets to your question. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2332.38s)]
*  I think we need to shift from a perspective that the United States is going to resolve conflicts [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2337.6600000000003s)]
*  to a perspective that the United States is going to manage those conflicts. The goal is to resolve [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2342.06s)]
*  them, but that's going to require an attitude and a series of tools that really approach more closely [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2346.1400000000003s)]
*  conflict management and de-escalation in the nearer and even sometimes in the medium term. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2352.38s)]
*  So you asked specifically about Yemen and Syria. And I think when you get to the specifics is where [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2357.8199999999997s)]
*  obviously this gets very hard. And I'm thankful you didn't ask me about Libya because that's the [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2362.9399999999996s)]
*  hardest of them all. But in both of these cases, I actually think that the outcome is going to be [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2366.7799999999997s)]
*  determined largely by the diplomatic choices that the United States makes based on leverage that's [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2374.9399999999996s)]
*  already been built over the course of the Trump administration in each country, in Syria because [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2379.74s)]
*  of the sanctions, in Yemen because of our additional reassurance to our Gulf partners, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2386.14s)]
*  and a new diplomatic approach which is going to move those conflicts in a better, I hope, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2392.7s)]
*  a better direction. I've already outlined what I think should be done in Syria. Yemen is not my [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2397.8199999999997s)]
*  area of expertise, but I think ultimately it will be wrapped into regional negotiations around Iran, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2401.74s)]
*  which I think we all agree is the regional element and the region dimension is absolutely [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2407.5s)]
*  essential. I don't see either of those suffering dramatically from the United States changing the [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2412.14s)]
*  way it thinks about the Middle East. All that said, I do think there are a couple of places where the [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2417.18s)]
*  U.S. needs to put it foot down pretty hard. One of those, and I lay these out in the chapter that I [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2422.2999999999997s)]
*  wrote about Russia, I don't think we should compete across the board. You know, George Kennan said a [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2428.14s)]
*  long time ago, you don't let the adversary choose the place and time of confrontation. Part of being [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2432.62s)]
*  successful strategically is choosing them yourself. And I think the place the United States needs to [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2437.9s)]
*  put its foot down are efforts to weaken NATO on the one hand, and that relates to our policy with [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2441.9s)]
*  Turkey and our policy in Libya, and efforts by other states to interfere in world energy markets. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2448.46s)]
*  Those are the two places I think we have to compete and we have to compete robustly. There are other [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2454.46s)]
*  areas I think we're going to have to live with a different Middle East. Thank you. Joyce, I'm going [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2458.54s)]
*  to move to a different issue. There are massive changes underway in the region. The era of [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2464.22s)]
*  big earnings from oil is drawing to a close. The rentier period in the Arab world is ending. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2473.5s)]
*  New social contracts need to be written. Lebanon is a case in point. Iraq is a case in point. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2480.54s)]
*  Several places in the Arab world are cases in point. Do you think that these issues are being [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2489.1s)]
*  thought of by either the Biden campaign or the Trump campaign? Are these issues going to inform [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2498.46s)]
*  policies for the next administration or are the campaigns not really concerned with what is going [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2504.06s)]
*  on in terms of this historical transformation in the Arab world? Well, Marwan, if I can just make a [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2509.9s)]
*  quick point though on the Arab-Israeli conflict to the question that you asked, Daphna. I do think [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2517.02s)]
*  there is a level of changes that's happening in the region that we need to be cognizant of. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2524.94s)]
*  Aaron Miller, he's the processor of a lot of peace processes, had a very good peace in the [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2533.42s)]
*  Washington Post yesterday pointing that maybe the conventional wisdom in Washington has been wrong [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2540.7s)]
*  and maybe Arab countries are ready to normalize and are normalizing with Israel before [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2551.3399999999997s)]
*  the Palestinians. Now, that doesn't mean that the Arab-Israeli conflict as a whole will end. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2557.66s)]
*  That doesn't mean that the status quo in Palestine is tenable, but I do think there are things that [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2563.66s)]
*  are changing and being transformed in the region through the UAE and Bahrain agreements, whether [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2571.98s)]
*  we agree with them or not. On the Palestinian issue specifically, I don't know what's going to [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2582.14s)]
*  happen to the Palestinian Authority. You know better than all of us the amount of pressure [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2588.94s)]
*  that they are under, the economic and political pressure. What if it collapses? What if it holds [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2596.38s)]
*  security cooperation with Israel? These are questions that will be faced by the next [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2604.3s)]
*  president. I think both sides, the Trump administration and a Biden administration, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2611.02s)]
*  would want to engage the Palestinians, but there are changes happening in the Arab-Israeli conflict [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2620.38s)]
*  that we need to realize and just deal with them accordingly. In that sense, I think a Joe Biden [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2628.7000000000003s)]
*  administration would carry on the Gulf agreements with Israel, the progress that has been made. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2639.26s)]
*  He welcomed it. There is bipartisan also embraced from Congress. Now, to your question, this is a [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2648.5400000000004s)]
*  very different Middle East. I don't know how much the campaigns, how much attention they're paying [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2660.14s)]
*  to the details that are happening day to day in the Middle East. You have a pandemic in the U.S. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2670.62s)]
*  You have social unrest. We're faced by changes of historic proportions inside the United States [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2677.18s)]
*  itself and that I think is taking a lot of the air in the room in both campaigns. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2687.1s)]
*  But I do agree that a Biden administration would pay more attention, for example, to issues of [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2696.2999999999997s)]
*  human rights, would put more pressure on U.S. partners in the region. Both Trump and Biden have [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2701.9s)]
*  said that they want a new deal or a deal with Iran. Trump wants a new deal. He wants Iran to [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2712.86s)]
*  come back to the table, but he wants a tougher deal than the JCPOA. Is that attainable? I don't know. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2722.94s)]
*  Again, I think the Biden idea of returning to the old JCPOA may not bear fruit because [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2731.1800000000003s)]
*  you have an arms embargo that's set to expire in October. You have a much more expansive Iranian [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2743.5s)]
*  influence in the region, whether it's Lebanon, whether it's Iraq, whether it's Yemen, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2756.86s)]
*  or Bahrain, they're still very active. I think Michael said their malign activities are on the [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2762.38s)]
*  rise. These are things we need to come to terms with. Again, if you're going to do the JCPOA [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2767.66s)]
*  all over again with no support from Congress, I'm not sure the region will take it seriously [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2779.42s)]
*  because the next president or the next administration could walk away from that. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2786.2999999999997s)]
*  Maybe this is the time to bring forth bipartisan foreign policy framework to the Middle East, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2795.18s)]
*  whether it's the Arab-Israeli conflict or the Iran nuclear issue. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2806.62s)]
*  Thank you, Joyce. Daphna, I'm going to ask you one last question. I have a lot of questions, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2814.3799999999997s)]
*  but I want to open the floor to questions from the audience. I want to remind the audience again [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2819.42s)]
*  that you can send your questions so that we can attempt to answer them. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2825.82s)]
*  I do want to talk about governance again. Governance is an issue of increasing importance [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2833.7400000000002s)]
*  in the Middle East. The Arab Spring took place because of the lack of governance. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2840.94s)]
*  The Trump administration doesn't seem to have given it much thought, but if the U.S. is to [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2845.34s)]
*  increase foreign aid toward governance in MENA, how can this assistance be earmarked such that [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2851.18s)]
*  corrupt governments or officials do not use it to line their own pockets? We have Lebanon as a [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2858.54s)]
*  point, or to direct it toward regime supporters. A corollary to that, does the U.S. administration [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2866.38s)]
*  care? Is the Middle East losing ground? Is the Middle East still as important as it was before, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2879.82s)]
*  or is the United States going to pivot to other countries, regions, whether it's China or anything [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2888.06s)]
*  else? You have to unmute yourself, please. Great. Thank you so much, Marwan, for that question. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2894.38s)]
*  That reminds me that I wanted to explain a little bit what the origin of this book is, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2902.46s)]
*  and I want to really give a lot of credit to Andrew Miller, who couldn't be with us today, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2906.3s)]
*  but he is my co-editor. The two of us have been working in government together, and we [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2909.34s)]
*  came upon two observations. One, there was this binary discussion in both the Obama and now Trump [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2914.3s)]
*  administration about overinvestment in the Middle East on one hand versus getting out, and that [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2920.62s)]
*  seemed to be the discussion. We collected a group of authors who really had a middle way, who seemed [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2927.98s)]
*  to understand the realities, as you point out, that the Middle East is not the center and center [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2933.98s)]
*  of gravity of U.S. foreign policy, as it might have been 20 years ago or 25 years ago, and that's just [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2939.1s)]
*  a reality. There's other issues and national security issues that are arising, but that does [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2943.8199999999997s)]
*  not mean that the U.S. should totally get out of it and to withdraw all diplomatic and military [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2948.94s)]
*  investment time and, as Alex says, energy of senior officials. That was one of the generators [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2954.7000000000003s)]
*  of this book, origins of this book, was to create this middle way of explanations of how you can [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2960.94s)]
*  pragmatically invest in the Middle East diplomatically as opposed to militarily and [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2965.26s)]
*  get more for a little bit less. Then second, in terms of governance, this is a generation of [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2971.1s)]
*  authors who've all really been informed by the Arab Spring protests of 2011. Almost all of us [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2975.82s)]
*  worked in government, seeing what happened after 2011, seeing how the U.S. tried so hard to support [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2981.42s)]
*  the protest movement without pushing too hard, and really how there was limits to U.S. leverage [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2987.6600000000003s)]
*  and influence in those years subsequently. This is really one of the issues, the question of [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2992.7000000000003s)]
*  governance, that informed this particular group of writers. On the point of governance and [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=2998.54s)]
*  assistance, it's one of the trickiest objectives in foreign assistance, is how to support [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3003.74s)]
*  governance. Governance is inherently a local and domestic process. It's about a relationship [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3009.1s)]
*  between citizens and their public. It's very different in each of the countries of the Middle [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3013.74s)]
*  East, so it's very hard to generalize, even among neighboring countries. The United States hasn't [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3018.14s)]
*  really gotten it right. It has really, really struggled. It's not necessarily a question of [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3023.58s)]
*  how much money in foreign assistance towards governance. Really, the solution is the combination [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3028.4599999999996s)]
*  of the right programs of foreign assistance plus the right diplomacy. How do you marry the diplomatic [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3033.42s)]
*  push on ministers and on prime ministers to make reforms with the company technical support in that [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3039.58s)]
*  direction? The U.S., like other countries, have really struggled in getting that right, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3047.02s)]
*  in both the technical, diplomatic, and programmatic element. Lebanon is a good example. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3051.9s)]
*  Last fall, when the protests first started in October in Lebanon, there was a diplomatic [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3056.7s)]
*  moment that the Trump administration, in my view, missed to go in and say, we're such an important [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3063.2599999999998s)]
*  partner. We care about so many things. We want to see Lebanon succeed, but you really have to make [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3067.82s)]
*  governance reform, and to really be a little tougher in the diplomatic messaging last fall. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3072.62s)]
*  Not necessarily to condition the aid, but to say we are going to give aid as we see reforms unfold [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3078.14s)]
*  in this government. I see that as a real missed opportunity last fall, and then we all know what's [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3084.4599999999996s)]
*  happened in the past couple of months. I see, again, this combination and this complementarity [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3089.18s)]
*  between the tough diplomacy on one hand, and the other hand, the programmatic assistance from [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3094.54s)]
*  foreign assistance, and then the third part is the multilateral, getting the international [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3099.2599999999998s)]
*  financial institutions and partners in Europe to back up the message in unison. That is the only [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3103.1s)]
*  way there'll be progress in some of these governance issues. Okay, let me try to turn to [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3108.46s)]
*  the audience now, and let me start with a question from Jean Abinader, who reminds us that the Middle [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3117.58s)]
*  East does not exist just east of Egypt. What about U.S. interests in North Africa? What should the U.S. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3124.94s)]
*  do to promote progress in Libya, in Morocco, in Tunisia? This is a question to any of you, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3131.8199999999997s)]
*  who would like to pick it up? Maybe we can hear from both [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3138.7s)]
*  the perspectives of the Trump administration or a Biden administration. Who wants to start? [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3147.42s)]
*  Mick, would you like to take a go at it? Sure. Just to be clear, the Middle East, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3155.6600000000003s)]
*  when it comes to the Middle East and the Pentagon, it only includes Egypt when it comes to North [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3165.34s)]
*  Africa. I wasn't just trying to direct the question, but I haven't focused on that in [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3170.3s)]
*  several years. I do think that we should acknowledge that the Middle East does [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3176.7000000000003s)]
*  include that. In Libya, one of the most complicated parts of that situation is that [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3182.7s)]
*  our allies, the people who have their objectives in mind, aren't the same as they are in other [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3188.62s)]
*  places, say, for example, Yemen, which hopefully we'll have a question on that, I'd like to talk [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3196.22s)]
*  about. But I do think we need to spend a lot of time with our allies, with our partners, [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3201.9s)]
*  with our partners, and come up with a cohesive plan for Libya that we can all [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3208.7s)]
*  understand and we can all push for. But because I haven't focused on it in the last few years, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3215.98s)]
*  I'd like to throw that over to some of the other panel members. Would you like to say a few words [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3221.9s)]
*  about Yemen, Mick, since there is a question about what the U.S. should do in Yemen? Yes, thanks. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3227.1s)]
*  So, one of the things that I think from the U.S. perspective, and then I'd like to broaden that [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3234.94s)]
*  because it's important that we do, the carryover of our assistance to the Satellite Coalition in [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3239.66s)]
*  Yemen was the Department of Defense provided aerially fueling to their aircraft, we provided [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3246.94s)]
*  intelligence support, limited intelligence support, and then side-by-side coaching to their [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3252.54s)]
*  the Satellite Coalition's air campaign. That has become pretty controversial. I would like to say [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3258.1400000000003s)]
*  on that front, it was a carryover from the previous administration to the current administration. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3264.86s)]
*  And essentially, from the DOD's perspective, it allowed us access and then the ability to influence [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3269.9s)]
*  how the Saudi-led coalition conducted their air campaign, which from our perspective was the best [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3278.5400000000004s)]
*  practices when it came to that. So, providing no-strike lists for all the things that go into [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3284.7s)]
*  reducing the amount of civilian casualties. I understand there are still significant problems [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3292.54s)]
*  with that. I personally, however, don't think that reducing, if not eliminating, the U.S. Air Force's [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3297.5s)]
*  influence into that is going to improve or reduce civilian casualties. That said, whether the next [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3303.4199999999996s)]
*  administration decides to continue this rather limited support or not, we do need to lead the [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3312.22s)]
*  international community in coming up with a comprehensive plan for Yemen. And by comprehensive, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3317.8199999999997s)]
*  I mean, from our perspective, it's primarily counterterrorism, but it needs to be much broader [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3323.8199999999997s)]
*  than that. It needs to include economic, political, security, and of course, humanitarian assistance to [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3328.54s)]
*  a country that's very much in need. That process is being led by the United Nations. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3335.58s)]
*  We need to do everything we can to contribute to the successful outcome to a unity government and [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3342.22s)]
*  then to ensuring that if it happens, it's successful. And this is far beyond just the counterterrorism [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3348.54s)]
*  efforts that we've conducted in Yemen. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3355.1s)]
*  Marouf, if we can just mention Sudan in this context to Jean Abinader's question, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3356.7s)]
*  I do think we have a success story when it comes to U.S. policy in Sudan, starting with the Obama [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3368.46s)]
*  administration that carried on to the Trump administration and engagement with Sudan. It's [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3374.62s)]
*  that engagement. It's that dialogue with Sudan that helped overthrow Omar al-Bashir. And I think [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3381.5s)]
*  the Khartoum is now at an important juncture. So it's important to get this transition [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3389.34s)]
*  right. And the U.S. can help a great deal in questions related to the economic stability, [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3397.66s)]
*  to good governance in the country that could lead to removing Sudan from the state sponsorship of [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3406.4599999999996s)]
*  terrorism. North Africa, I mean, you have same questions about reforms still being raised in [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3413.1s)]
*  Algeria. So we don't see as much U.S. influence there. We're seeing, you know, it's more of a French [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3422.9399999999996s)]
*  leverage, but it is important to work with the French on that. And on Lebanon, what Daphna [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3431.1000000000004s)]
*  mentioned, yes, I agree the Trump administration, you know, made a big mistake in the last December [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3439.1000000000004s)]
*  when David Hale, Under Secretary David Hale, went and held a more than two-hour meeting with [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3446.94s)]
*  Jebran Basile, who is a lightning rod, you know, for the protesters there. They're just, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3454.46s)]
*  most of the protests were against him. But we are seeing a pivot in the last few months, [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3463.8199999999997s)]
*  and the U.S. I think is putting a lot of pressure to work with the French to bring forth certain [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3470.62s)]
*  reforms that would be key for IMF or U.S. assistance. So that's the balance, I think, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3479.18s)]
*  that's being struck in Lebanon now. I want to stay on the North Africa theme [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3487.18s)]
*  for a short while. The U.S. does not seem to many to be paying enough attention to Tunisia. I mean, [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3493.98s)]
*  if there is one positive development that took place as a result of the Aras-Prig, it's Tunisia, [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3502.14s)]
*  where a new social contract has been written, where democratization has taken place, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3510.94s)]
*  where the rights of women were upheld, where a peaceful transition of power was done. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3515.74s)]
*  I mean, all of these, yes, Tunisia is not out of the woods, but all of these are positive [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3521.1s)]
*  developments that can affect the whole Arab world. Yet, for some reason, neither the Obama [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3525.3399999999997s)]
*  administration nor the Trump administration have given Tunisia enough attention. How do you respond [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3530.62s)]
*  to that? So maybe I'll jump in here. And first, I want to appreciate the question. And we try to [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3537.98s)]
*  address, we have a whole chapter on Egypt in the book, and try, as I said before, each of these [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3546.94s)]
*  countries in North Africa is very different. And although we often think about it as a whole, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3551.42s)]
*  the situation in Libya is quite different from Morocco, from Tunisia, from Algeria, and Egypt [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3555.8199999999997s)]
*  as well. On Tunisia, I think it's a fair critique that there wasn't enough done. In the very [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3561.2599999999998s)]
*  beginning, when Tunisia had its democratic transition, there was a lot of energy and [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3567.1s)]
*  excitement, but the follow through was probably weaker than we should have done in Tunisia. And [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3571.74s)]
*  last year, the Obama administration, and certainly the Trump administration, has ignored it, [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3575.8999999999996s)]
*  I think failing to see a couple things. One, there's a demonstration value to it. The success [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3581.18s)]
*  of the consolidation of democracy and the democratic transition in Tunisia will have a [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3588.22s)]
*  ripple effect, motivating and generating all kinds of lessons for the rest of the Arab world. But [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3592.8599999999997s)]
*  second, it's a strategic location, a strategic partner. So I do think that there has been, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3598.22s)]
*  as you say, a mistake of neglecting Tunisia. I do also say that there's been some positive in [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3604.2999999999997s)]
*  the assistance in particular to Tunisia, because there wasn't a history, as there was in Egypt and [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3609.58s)]
*  in other countries, of the security assistance package. The United States was able to, in 2012, [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3615.42s)]
*  2013, to remake security assistance in a way that was joint, that was mutual, that really [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3621.18s)]
*  asked the Tunisian government, what is your biggest security threat? And so in Tunisia, [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3626.86s)]
*  we've seen the growth of the economic assistance and security assistance in a way that are much [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3631.2599999999998s)]
*  healthier than we've seen elsewhere in the region. And I credit that to the ability to kind of [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3635.42s)]
*  start a new post-revolution to figure out how the US can support the fight against Al-Qaeda and [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3639.5s)]
*  ISIS, how the US can support the borders, for example, of Tunisia, which have been very [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3646.46s)]
*  threatened by the war in Libya. So I do think that there's a lot of lessons on both security [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3650.54s)]
*  assistance and economic assistance. What happens when you start again from fresh and you ask, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3655.82s)]
*  what does this country need and what is in the US interest? [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3660.2200000000003s)]
*  Another important country is Saudi Arabia. And one of the questions from the audience [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3662.78s)]
*  regards the relationship with Saudi Arabia. If Biden is re-elected, Saudi Arabia has undergone [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3668.78s)]
*  tremendous changes in its relationship with the United States, particularly in Congress. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3677.34s)]
*  Under President Trump, in his own words, he has done a lot to save the world. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3683.42s)]
*  He has done a lot to save the Saudis after the Khashoggi affair. Would a Biden [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3689.98s)]
*  presidency be more critical openly of the Saudi policies? [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3699.7400000000002s)]
*  Maybe Alex can take a jab at that. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3709.66s)]
*  Thanks. I'll take a quick jab at that. But I also just want to underscore a couple [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3713.34s)]
*  points that were made about North Africa and add one of my own. I want to agree very strongly with [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3716.54s)]
*  what Joyce said about Sudan. I think that that does date back to some of the engagement efforts [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3722.14s)]
*  of the Obama administration. I think that's a set of positive developments that the US should try [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3726.46s)]
*  to build on. I think we left Libya largely out of that conversation, which I think is unfortunate. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3731.58s)]
*  The United States has been trying in a very limited way to shape the political outcome there for a [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3740.06s)]
*  very long time and not with a whole lot of success. I think there are limits to what the United [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3745.74s)]
*  States can achieve there and I think there are limits to our interests in Libya. But I do think [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3752.22s)]
*  the United States needs to lean forward a little bit more, whether under a Trump administration or [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3755.74s)]
*  a Biden administration, to make sure that a ceasefire can hold to bring some of our allies and [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3759.8199999999997s)]
*  partners into a more constructive place and, if necessary, to be a little bit more forward-leaning [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3766.7799999999997s)]
*  with sanctions and other tools which can shape the environment for some kind of a solution. I [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3772.46s)]
*  think a kind of festering Libya is something that Russia is very adeptly exploiting right now and I [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3776.86s)]
*  think that's not in our interest. Saudi Arabia, there are others in this group who know more than [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3782.54s)]
*  I do on this particular question, but I do think that a Biden administration would see Saudi Arabia [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3788.14s)]
*  as a key partner in the Middle East, but I think there would be more criticism. I think the Khashoggi [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3794.94s)]
*  affair really soured the view of Saudi Arabia. I think there's a general recognition, certainly [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3800.7s)]
*  within the Democratic Party, but I think it's broader than that that Saudi Arabia's actions in [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3809.3399999999997s)]
*  Yemen have been destructive, particularly for Yemeni civilians. And so I think there would be [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3813.58s)]
*  a tougher set of conditions placed on the Saudis that the United States has expectations that come [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3820.54s)]
*  with the assistance that the United States provides to Saudi Arabia and that meeting those [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3827.9s)]
*  expectations in a cooperative and hopefully collaborative way would be an important part of [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3832.2200000000003s)]
*  continuing to move forward together. So whether that would be public or private is, I think, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3835.98s)]
*  a separate question, but I do expect that the relationship would change. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3842.3s)]
*  Let me go back to the peace process. There are a couple of questions on the peace process. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3847.02s)]
*  One is the Trump plan for the Middle East does call for a two-state solution. So how [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3852.38s)]
*  can we say that this plan actually damaged that concept? And another question [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3859.34s)]
*  regarding the peace process is what does a new dawn of the Middle East as portrayed by President [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3866.38s)]
*  Trump mean? Is it towards more stabilization or creating new zones of conflict? [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3874.46s)]
*  So why don't you start, Joyce? [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3884.06s)]
*  The Trump plan does not clearly call for a two-state solution. It calls [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3889.42s)]
*  for certain steps that Palestinians should take while still under occupation, and if that works [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3897.42s)]
*  out, then it's up to Israel to determine whether they get their own state or not. So we should be [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3906.38s)]
*  clear on that. A new dawn for the Middle East, I mean, it's a new dawn maybe for Arab-Israeli [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3914.5400000000004s)]
*  relations. I don't know if it's the new dawn for the whole region. And back to what we mentioned, [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3924.54s)]
*  that yes, we have to realize that things are changing in the Gulf vis-a-vis Israel, and we [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3932.46s)]
*  may see more agreements, more normalization coming from Gulf countries toward Israel. And that [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3944.46s)]
*  breaks the paradigm that we've seen since 1948 in dealing with this conflict. But the major [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3952.46s)]
*  question that would resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict is the future of the Palestinians, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3960.78s)]
*  and that's still not determined. A Biden administration would perhaps build on [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3967.42s)]
*  the Gulf openness to Israel and re-engage the Palestinians. But if President Trump wins a [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3974.46s)]
*  second term, I don't see any options for the Palestinian Authority except they'd have to come [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3982.2200000000003s)]
*  to the table. Even the plan that the Trump administration put forth does not realize their [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3988.38s)]
*  sovereignty and their independent state in the future. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=3998.38s)]
*  I will not resist the opportunity to also comment on this, if you will allow me. But [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4005.34s)]
*  the Trump plan calls, as Joyce said, that given certain conditions that the Palestinians [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4014.2200000000003s)]
*  will have to meet and Israel will have to judge, the best they can hope for is a state on 70% of [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4020.7s)]
*  the West Bank surrounded by all sides, on all sides by Israel. That's not particular. In name, [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4025.98s)]
*  it is a two-state solution. In actual terms, it's a bandistan surrounded on all sides. It has no [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4033.58s)]
*  chance of being a viable Palestinian state. The other comment I want to make is we need, I think, [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4040.46s)]
*  to see things in perspective. At the surface, any, of course, agreement between two countries looks [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4046.3s)]
*  good. But in my view, I think that the two countries should be able to reach an agreement [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4051.98s)]
*  that is not a two-state solution. And I think that the two countries should be able to reach an [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4060.14s)]
*  agreement. But in my view, if it doesn't lead to the resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict, [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4067.58s)]
*  Israel can sign agreements with the whole Arab world. If it doesn't come to terms with the [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4075.58s)]
*  Palestinians who are living amongst them, then you are not going to see a new dawn and you certainly [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4080.54s)]
*  will not see a region that will be stable, secure, and peaceful. So that is the problem with [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4086.94s)]
*  the agreements in my view. Not that they are not good in general, but the question to ask is whether [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4097.820000000001s)]
*  they are going to be used as a replacement for a resolution of the conflict with the Palestinians. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4105.5s)]
*  And in my view, they cannot be a replacement, even if all Arab countries sign peace agreements [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4112.9400000000005s)]
*  with Israel. We do have only five minutes left, but, Daphna, I want to give you the opportunity [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4119.42s)]
*  to talk about the book a bit. Why was it written and what do you hope people will learn from it [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4126.14s)]
*  in the five minutes that we have left? Sure. And I want to thank all of you for participating [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4132.700000000001s)]
*  and really our panelists for joining us, to Joyce and Alex and Mick, Marwan and Tess of Carnegie, [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4137.9800000000005s)]
*  for holding this discussion. There's so much more we could have gotten into. And to thank [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4143.5s)]
*  all the authors, we have a chapter on Libya that talks about how you move forward, etc. So I really [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4147.18s)]
*  commend the book. And just one more point on Saudi Arabia and Yemen. I think it's very important [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4151.98s)]
*  because the public discussion often lumps two issues together. And issue number one is what is [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4157.259999999999s)]
*  U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen? And Mick describes some of the elements of that [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4163.099999999999s)]
*  support. But I do think that there's a consensus across Republican and Democrat, maybe not the [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4167.98s)]
*  Trump administration, but certainly in Congress and the American people, that it's time for the [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4172.78s)]
*  United States to really end all of the material support to this campaign, to move towards a [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4176.459999999999s)]
*  diplomatic solution. And the United States should no longer be involved in this campaign in any way. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4181.1s)]
*  And I think that consensus has been reached. It came very democratically via Congress. But that's [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4185.660000000001s)]
*  only point number one. Point number two, that is an important decision in and of itself. But point [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4189.660000000001s)]
*  number two is how to actually end the war, which is much more complicated, which as everyone knows, [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4194.54s)]
*  has grown and become very fractious with many parties on each side. And I do think of all the [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4198.9400000000005s)]
*  conflicts in the Middle East, in my personal view, helping to resolve and investing diplomatically [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4203.42s)]
*  in Yemen is really, really important. Now, the book. As I mentioned, this group of authors [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4208.38s)]
*  really work together, often behind the scenes, often writing papers to more senior officials [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4215.1s)]
*  during a very tumultuous time for the Middle East. This was a group that, unlike earlier generations [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4220.3s)]
*  and Middle East experts, had not been informed by the Camp David. Some of us had worked through [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4225.5s)]
*  9-11 and the Iraq War. But most of us really were working in the government when Obama came in and [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYtm_I8RQM&t=4229.66s)]
