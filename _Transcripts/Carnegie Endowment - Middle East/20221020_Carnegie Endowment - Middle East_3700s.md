Video Description: The decision earlier this month by the Saudi-led OPEC Plus to cut oil production in coordination with Russia has escalated tensions in the U.S.-Saudi relationship. The Biden administration has pledged to respond "methodically" to what it perceives as a flagrant snub and collusion with Moscow, while bipartisan calls have erupted in Congress to halt security assistance to Saudi Arabia. For its part, Riyadh asserts it was acting solely out of economic self-interest.

What's next for the troubled, decades-long U.S.-Saudi partnership and how have shifts in the global order changed each side's stake in it? What are Biden's policy options moving forward?

Join Carnegieâ€™s Frederic Wehrey as he welcomes U.S. Senator Chris Murphy, Hala Al-Dosari, and Martin Indyk to discuss the future of U.S.-Saudi relations.

# U.S.-Saudi Relations: What Next?
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [October 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4)
*  Thank you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=0.0s)]
*  Good afternoon from Washington, D.C. I'm Fred Wary, a senior fellow in the Middle East [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=27.0s)]
*  program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=31.0s)]
*  It's my pleasure to welcome you to this virtual discussion on U.S.-Saudi relations. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=34.44s)]
*  What next? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=39.72s)]
*  The Saudi move earlier this month to cut oil production in conjunction with Russia as part [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=41.0s)]
*  of the OPEC plus has thrust the U.S.-Saudi relationship into a new phase of crisis. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=45.86s)]
*  The Biden administration, along with a chorus of bipartisan voices in Congress, view the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=52.72s)]
*  move as a flagrant snub and collusion with Putin. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=58.08s)]
*  The Saudis, for their part, maintain that the move was entirely due to economic self-interest [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  at home. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=67.32s)]
*  The question then arises, what next? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  Does this latest crisis signal a significant rupture in a relationship that many have argued [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=71.86s)]
*  its strategic logic for America and become more of a liability? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=78.32s)]
*  Or is it yet another bump in a frequently rocky but still vital partnership that was [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=83.47999999999999s)]
*  always based more on mutual interest rather than shared values? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=88.91999999999999s)]
*  To tackle these questions, I'm very pleased to welcome our distinguished analyst, Senator [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=94.52s)]
*  Chris Murphy of Connecticut. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=100.6s)]
*  As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he's been a longtime advocate for [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=103.82s)]
*  revising the Saudi-U.S. partnership. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=108.25999999999999s)]
*  Dr. Hala Al-Dosri is a leading Saudi scholar and activist who focuses on human rights, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=111.38s)]
*  health, and gender relations. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=118.62s)]
*  And Ambassador Martin Indyk is a distinguished fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=121.06s)]
*  who has held a variety of senior U.S. government posts related to the Middle East. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=126.3s)]
*  Senator Murphy, we'll start with you, and thank you so much again for joining us. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=132.58s)]
*  You've publicly called for a reevaluation of the Saudi-U.S. partnership. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=137.14000000000001s)]
*  Walk us through the specifics of what that reevaluation should look like. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=143.98000000000002s)]
*  What would you like to see moving forward from the Biden administration? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=149.3s)]
*  Well, first of all, thank you to Carnegie for hosting the three of us. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=152.78s)]
*  Fred, thanks for your leadership in pulling us together. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=157.7s)]
*  I am very much the amateur on this panel compared to the amount of time that both Martin and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=163.1s)]
*  Hala have spent workshopping the U.S.-Saudi relationship, both past, present, and future. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=170.1s)]
*  It is no secret I have long been a proponent for a serious rethink of the foundations of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=179.38s)]
*  the U.S.-Saudi partnership. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=187.3s)]
*  My study of this relationship sprang forth from my early opposition to the Iraq War. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=190.54000000000002s)]
*  I was elected to Congress in 2006 as an opponent of the Iraq War, but I was deeply dissatisfied [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=198.54000000000002s)]
*  with my positioning being simply opposition to a war that at the time the administration [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=204.42000000000002s)]
*  was selling as necessary to combat global extremism. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=213.54s)]
*  I dug deeper into the roots of Sunni extremism and found that many of those roots ran straight [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=218.01999999999998s)]
*  through our Gulf partners who were sometimes quietly, sometimes not so quietly, providing [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=226.1s)]
*  significant funding to the very radical clerics that were often organizing against the United [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=231.89999999999998s)]
*  States. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=239.01999999999998s)]
*  My first remarks on this topic of reorienting the U.S.-Saudi relationship came way back [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=240.5s)]
*  in 2016 when at the time I was much more focused on this question of the Gulf States' support [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=246.02s)]
*  for radical organizations around the world. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=253.58s)]
*  To MBS's credit, he has made progress on that front, and there is less money than before [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=257.78000000000003s)]
*  moving out of Saudi Arabia to some of the forces that we are fighting. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=265.7s)]
*  But unfortunately, he has replaced that significant irritant in our relationship with several [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=271.18s)]
*  other irritants. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=277.74s)]
*  This is a regime that is much more engaged in the massive systematic repression of political [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=279.36s)]
*  dissent inside and outside of Saudi Arabia, sometimes very often in incredibly public [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=286.06s)]
*  ways that make it very difficult for the United States to continue to be a strategic partner. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=292.02s)]
*  This is a regime that is much more militarily engaged in the region. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=297.66s)]
*  It used to be that when we sold weapons to the Saudis that they would largely collect [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=302.5s)]
*  dusts in warehouses and on airfields. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=307.22s)]
*  Now they are used to fight proxy wars against Iran, to bomb civilians in Yemen, and to, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=309.46s)]
*  once again, make it very difficult morally and strategically for the United States to [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=316.58s)]
*  continue to attach themselves to this regime. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=321.22s)]
*  And as Iran continues its provocative behaviors and gets closer and closer to a nuclear weapon, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=325.22s)]
*  there is just no question that the United States, through our funding of one side of [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=330.1s)]
*  that proxy war, has stimulated an arms race between Shia and Sunni in the region, none [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=334.98s)]
*  of which accrues to the security benefit of the United States. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=342.12s)]
*  I think the reasons have been present for a long time for a broader rethink of our [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=345.82s)]
*  alliance, not just Saudi Arabia, but with the Gulf states in general. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=352.58s)]
*  And I've written on this topic several times. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=356.78s)]
*  I certainly wasn't surprised by the Saudis' most recent decision to decrease oil output [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=359.94s)]
*  through the OPEC Plus mechanism, not just because I've been watching them act in ways [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=367.65999999999997s)]
*  contrary to our security interests for the better part of a decade, but because since [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=375.02s)]
*  the outset of the Ukraine war, it's been pretty clear that the Saudis were intent on choosing [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=379.06s)]
*  the Russian side rather than the U.S. side. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=387.26s)]
*  They had the opportunity early on to try to stem the dramatic increase in fuel prices [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=389.41999999999996s)]
*  around the world. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=396.46s)]
*  They essentially forced the president of the United States to show up and shake hands with [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=398.21999999999997s)]
*  Mohammed bin Salman in order to even consider acting in a way that would ultimately bring [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=404.46s)]
*  down prices for the United States. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=410.78s)]
*  They had the opportunity to divorce themselves from Russia inside OPEC Plus. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=413.14s)]
*  They did not do that. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=417.21999999999997s)]
*  They continued to coordinate with the Russians. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=418.21999999999997s)]
*  And then, of course, they had the opportunity to at least hold oil consumption flat over [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=420.18s)]
*  the course of the remainder of this year. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=427.14s)]
*  My sense is that that's what the administration expected based upon representations made by [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=429.4s)]
*  the Saudis. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=434.14s)]
*  They made a very different decision. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=435.14s)]
*  I mean, I thought the whole purpose of spending billions of dollars in U.S. taxpayer money [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=436.82s)]
*  on the defense of Saudi Arabia, the whole purpose of deploying thousands of our troops, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=445.94s)]
*  putting our troops' lives on the line inside Saudi Arabia, I thought the whole purpose [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=451.82s)]
*  of looking the other way, as Jamal Khashoggi was chopped up into little pieces, and the [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=456.41999999999996s)]
*  continue to lock up American citizens inside Saudi Arabia. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=462.58000000000004s)]
*  I thought the whole purpose of all of that was that if there was a global crisis, right, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=467.58000000000004s)]
*  and we needed the Saudis to choose between us and the Russians or the Chinese, they would [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=473.42s)]
*  choose us. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=479.22s)]
*  They haven't. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=480.22s)]
*  I think this begs the question of whether we can stand to be part of an alliance structure [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=483.66s)]
*  with the Saudis in which when the chips are down, we don't get the benefit of the doubt. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=493.14s)]
*  So I hope over the course of this event, we'll talk about the ways in which we can shape [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=498.26s)]
*  the future of our partnership with Saudi Arabia. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=503.94s)]
*  I don't argue for a wholesale withdrawal of security cooperation. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=506.62s)]
*  I just think we should be stingier about the ways in which we engage with Saudi Arabia, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=510.78000000000003s)]
*  the fights we're willing to support them in. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=516.38s)]
*  I think we have far too much hardware and too much personnel on the ground. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=518.74s)]
*  I think we can think about how we engage with them commercially. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=524.46s)]
*  Do we want to continue to encourage so many American companies to do business with Saudi [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=528.34s)]
*  Arabia in the face of this fraying alliance? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=532.46s)]
*  And then I think I'll say this finally and then turn it back over to you all. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=537.14s)]
*  I think we do need to step back and really ask the fundamental question of whether the [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=541.54s)]
*  United States needs to be so directly involved in this growing contest for regional hegemony [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=547.9399999999999s)]
*  between Saudi Arabia and their Gulf allies and Iran, whether we need to be so directly [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=557.02s)]
*  involved more broadly in the fight between the future of Islam, between Shia and Sunni [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=562.34s)]
*  forces. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=568.14s)]
*  The foreign policy consensus in Washington for decades has been clear that yes, it is [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=569.14s)]
*  in our interest to play a role in that fight. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=573.7800000000001s)]
*  And when we look at the way Iran is brutally repressing these legitimate protesters, makes [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=576.82s)]
*  us feel a little bit more confident that we should be on the side of the Saudis against [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=584.86s)]
*  Iran. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=589.82s)]
*  But let's also be honest, if there was a similar protest movement simmering on the streets [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=591.7s)]
*  of Riyadh, do we really think the Saudis would treat it much differently than the Iranians [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=597.82s)]
*  have? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=603.0200000000001s)]
*  Are we sure that the Saudis value set is fundamentally different than that of the Iranians? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=604.0200000000001s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=608.5s)]
*  And so to me, this is a moment not just to recalibrate the tactical nature of our relationship [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=609.7800000000001s)]
*  with Saudi Arabia, but to really think about our positioning in the Gulf, to really think [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=617.0600000000001s)]
*  about our positioning in the region and to consider whether we are better or worse off [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=621.7s)]
*  over the course of the next decade, continuing to be so firmly planted on one side of that [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=626.58s)]
*  regional contest for power. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=633.26s)]
*  So thanks for having me be part of this today. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=635.1400000000001s)]
*  Great. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=638.9000000000001s)]
*  Thanks so much, Senator. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=640.9000000000001s)]
*  A lot of food for thought there. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=641.9000000000001s)]
*  That's a great opener. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=642.9000000000001s)]
*  I'm sure we're going to be circling back to some of those points. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=643.9000000000001s)]
*  Dr. Helle, turning to you as a longtime advocate for human rights, you noted in an interview [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=647.58s)]
*  this summer that President Biden's trip to Riyadh was a, quote, betrayal of activists [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=655.5s)]
*  inside the kingdom. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=660.9s)]
*  And jumping off from that, moving forward, how can President Biden incorporate a rights-based [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=662.06s)]
*  approach in his response to Saudi Arabia? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=667.98s)]
*  And what tools and leverage does Washington have? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=671.38s)]
*  Well, thank you, Frederick, for having me. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=674.3s)]
*  And for having a Saudi voice in this kind of discussion. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=677.26s)]
*  This is something that we've been wishing for, to have more representation of the people [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=679.62s)]
*  rather than governments, you know, in any kinds of discussions on foreign policy. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=683.98s)]
*  So I'm here actually to discuss and facilitate, you know, how we can think of a relationship [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=688.1400000000001s)]
*  with the people rather than a relationship with the Saudi political system, one that [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=695.86s)]
*  is existent inside Saudi Arabia, where we are as Saudis and the world is held as hostage [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=702.1s)]
*  to the whims and vindictive nature of this autocratic regime. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=708.7s)]
*  As Senator Murphy has pointed correctly so, that it is a very difficult place to compare [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=714.14s)]
*  Iran and Saudi Arabia when it comes to respecting rights and freedom. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=722.34s)]
*  If the same events have erupted in Saudi Arabia, do we expect something different to happen? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=727.62s)]
*  And what is the United States doing in order to envision a Saudi Arabia that is reliable [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=733.94s)]
*  and responsible? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=739.78s)]
*  The oil economy that has erupted is one of the latest events in which the Saudi decision-making [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=742.06s)]
*  has been erratic, has been curbing on the forces, the internal forces within Saudi Arabia [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=749.74s)]
*  that could have actually mitigated the situation, that could have made some form of balances [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=755.66s)]
*  and checks on the public decision-making, on representing more of the public interest [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=762.98s)]
*  and therefore the public interest of the allies and the international community in general. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=768.62s)]
*  Why I say that it's a betrayal, it is a betrayal because what we've seen after the Biden visit, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=774.02s)]
*  and we've been forewarning the United States State Department and other entities from emboldening [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=780.3s)]
*  autocratic leaders of this kind of vindictive nature, what we have seen is now more American [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=788.62s)]
*  citizens are being impacted inside Saudi Arabia, let alone outside, as well as the mildly critical [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=795.26s)]
*  voices being handed draconian sentences of decades long. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=801.18s)]
*  So actually what I want, I may not be able to highlight all the leverage within the US [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=807.42s)]
*  to influence and reward good governance, but I can point to some of the damaging elements [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=815.74s)]
*  within the foreign policy of the US that both undermines the US ability and also the Saudi [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=819.74s)]
*  people's ability to influence their own governments. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=825.0999999999999s)]
*  So having the back channel of consultant, US consultants, PR companies and former top [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=828.9399999999999s)]
*  US officials working to cover up or even reward every wrong political decision by the Saudi [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=833.98s)]
*  leadership, including the disastrous war and eight-year plundering of Yemen for their own [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=840.1400000000001s)]
*  self-enrichment. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=846.46s)]
*  A good example, of course, is the top US official who obtained top classified intelligence and a [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=847.2600000000001s)]
*  deep knowledge of the US national security who's being rewarded by the Saudi government with 2 [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=852.38s)]
*  billion in private investments without any kinds of accountability or investigation, and [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=857.34s)]
*  therefore undermining both the Saudi and American people's interest. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=863.5s)]
*  The Washington Post has recently reported on years long service of top US military advisors [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=867.18s)]
*  to the Saudi regime who neither help our country resolve the wars and conflicts or protected the US [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=873.26s)]
*  interests from being influenced by foreign autocratic regimes. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=879.66s)]
*  The way ahead should be in theory, a simple and forward, invest in building a consistent [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=883.42s)]
*  relationship with the people. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=888.7s)]
*  Things that have created this kind of sense of responsibility share the values we've seen in [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=891.26s)]
*  Iran, we've seen in different places that people really are eager for democratic transition, for [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=897.82s)]
*  more respect for human rights, for more representation from their own governments, whether [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=903.6600000000001s)]
*  they were on different sides of the Shia and the Sunni conflicts. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=909.1800000000001s)]
*  So a good approach is one that is centered on people rather than oil interests and other [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=915.18s)]
*  volatile or short-term gains. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=920.4599999999999s)]
*  In the Saudi situation, this is not happening. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=923.26s)]
*  We are facing an unprecedented authoritarian regime that is increasingly supported by the [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=926.06s)]
*  rise of authoritarian powers in the region and in the world in general. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=930.54s)]
*  So as a member of the Saudi civil society, much can be improved. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=936.78s)]
*  We can empower this society to influence our own regime if we have the solidarity of the US [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=940.7s)]
*  government, businesses, or other entities. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=947.02s)]
*  Sadly, that is happening inconsistently, sometimes without any concrete or lasting results. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=949.98s)]
*  So while limited numbers of the Saudi activists, intellectuals, or businessmen and academics were [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=956.3s)]
*  released, they remain muzzled and under the collective punishments of travel bans sometimes [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=961.74s)]
*  to their own families. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=966.78s)]
*  There is no way that we as citizens, Saudi citizens, can impose any balances or checks on [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=968.3s)]
*  our political decision-making without those voices which were able to rally the Saudi [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=972.6999999999999s)]
*  public towards meaningful reforms. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=977.3399999999999s)]
*  A good recent example was this sweeping and successful Saudi public campaigns to affordish [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=980.3s)]
*  an end to the restrictions on women's mobility and autonomy, things that we are now witnessing [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=986.14s)]
*  in the new Saudi Arabia where the credit has been gone to an autocratic leader instead of the [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=991.66s)]
*  community that actually worked through these issues. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=999.18s)]
*  But now we are at a stage where the Saudi government is involved in not only to actively [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1002.86s)]
*  silence every influential voice but to boldly punish those with even petty grievances, like [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1007.18s)]
*  people objecting on forced land evictions. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1013.5799999999999s)]
*  For those advising to return to the basic approach of abandoning any relationship with the [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1018.3s)]
*  Saudi government, I would cautiously advise against that. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1022.78s)]
*  We're not in a position where it's either or. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1028.14s)]
*  I think we need a good strategy. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1031.74s)]
*  And Dawn, which is the democracy for the Arab world now, has actually published a very good [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1034.62s)]
*  study on the conditionality of aid and support to foreign governments from the U.S., [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1042.22s)]
*  more or less a good starting point to think ahead. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1048.3s)]
*  Saudi Arabia has an extensive and multilateral relations with the U.S. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1052.38s)]
*  government and businesses, and such relations can be a good leverage to start influencing [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1055.82s)]
*  a good governance. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1060.6200000000001s)]
*  So the U.S. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1061.74s)]
*  Congress as well is at a good place to rethink policies as Senator Murphy has pointed. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1062.38s)]
*  This is a good time now to act on policies and legislation and start thinking on ways [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1067.98s)]
*  to ensure two things. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1073.42s)]
*  First, that no U.S. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1074.7s)]
*  official entities are undermining the U.S. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1075.8200000000002s)]
*  or Saudi public interests, and that the support of democratic transition and rights for allied [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1078.7s)]
*  nations is the cornerstones of combating any kinds of disastrous policy of autocratic regimes. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1083.5s)]
*  Much of the debate within Saudi Arabia now is centered around the bipartisan nature of [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1092.38s)]
*  the threats, as they call it, to Saudi Arabia. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1100.54s)]
*  So having very much of those kinds of diversified or inconsistent positions from the foreign [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1105.3400000000001s)]
*  policy of the U.S. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1116.54s)]
*  towards Saudi Arabia really undermines any kinds of action and perceived by the Saudi [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1117.98s)]
*  regime as a winning point, basically. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1124.1399999999999s)]
*  They are winning by having these kinds of divided positions when it comes to what can [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1127.02s)]
*  be done. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1132.46s)]
*  As with other nations, of course, Saudi Arabia continues to be led, if it continues to be led [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1134.1399999999999s)]
*  undeterred by such an irresponsible and unreliable leader, I believe the repercussions will [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1138.78s)]
*  continue to happen and could be of a global effect, and not only on the Saudi people's [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1143.74s)]
*  rights and freedom. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1150.38s)]
*  And I believe this is a good time to act on it. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1151.82s)]
*  MR. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1153.98s)]
*  BOLLINGER Terrific, Khaled. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1154.46s)]
*  Thank you so much for those compelling remarks. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1159.5s)]
*  You raise a lot of important details and issues, especially on conditionality, and we'll [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1162.06s)]
*  certainly return to that. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1167.1s)]
*  Ambassador Indyk, I want to turn to you now. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1169.1s)]
*  You co-authored a CFR report and a Foreign Affairs article this summer arguing that [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1172.06s)]
*  Washington should offer a strategic commitment to Saudi Arabia against Iran in return for [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1178.62s)]
*  Saudi reciprocity on a number of issues, keeping oil prices low, ending the war in Yemen, making [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1185.34s)]
*  peace with Israel, and improving its human rights record. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1191.98s)]
*  And I think it's fairly obvious that Riyadh has not made progress on those issues, certainly [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1195.26s)]
*  not our number one or the last one. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1199.82s)]
*  So I guess now, how would you update those arguments? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1201.82s)]
*  What would you recommend moving forward in light of this month's events? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1204.54s)]
*  AMBASSADOR INDYK Well, thank you, Fred. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1208.78s)]
*  Thanks very much to Carnegie for hosting this important discussion. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1211.02s)]
*  I have the greatest respect for Senator Murphy. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1218.22s)]
*  I really admire his legislative record and the seriousness that he brings to all the [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1222.3s)]
*  things he does, but particularly his approach to foreign policy and particularly his approach [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1228.62s)]
*  to this subject, whereas he has noted he has a long record. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1233.26s)]
*  And how long have I haven't met before, but I also deeply respect the emphasis that she [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1238.06s)]
*  puts on the issue of human rights in Saudi Arabia. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1247.1s)]
*  We didn't have to conjure up the history of the way in which the Saudi regime under [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1251.02s)]
*  Mohammed bin Salman has dealt with these issues, particularly, of course, the murder and chopping [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1262.54s)]
*  up of the journalists, Jamal Khatrchi, but there are many other instances which are highly problematic. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1269.42s)]
*  And I think that it's also very important that we have in Senator Murphy's approach and [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1280.54s)]
*  Halal al-Dusari's approach to, in a sense, different, although complementary, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1288.94s)]
*  answers to the question of what kind of future we want to have in our relationship with Saudi [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1297.3400000000001s)]
*  Arabia. The president has now called for a reevaluation of the relationship, so I think [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1304.22s)]
*  this is a very important moment to have precisely this kind of discussion, and I think the president [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1311.18s)]
*  needs to order up some internal studies within the administration and some thorough consultation [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1319.02s)]
*  with the Congress to take advantage of this pause in the relationship, this reevaluation. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1328.86s)]
*  As Fred has noted, I have a different approach, I should say objective. It seems to me that [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1335.02s)]
*  Senator Murphy's objective can be described as something between a divorce and a transactional [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1344.54s)]
*  relationship. Halal is very clear about conditioning our relations on [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1351.58s)]
*  Saudi regime's treatment of its own people. But I approach it from a different perspective [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1359.58s)]
*  and think that actually we're in a situation where we can't live with MBS and we can't live [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1368.46s)]
*  without him. That is the kind of reality of what are we supposed to do then in that situation. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1377.42s)]
*  That's where my colleague Steve Cook and I came up with this idea of what one can call a grand [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1385.66s)]
*  bargain, a strategic compact in which Saudi Arabia needs a reliable US partner. Let's face it, in the [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1392.22s)]
*  last years we haven't been a reliable partner in the Middle East, particularly in the Trump [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1404.14s)]
*  administration but also in the Obama administration beforehand. We need to go, we need in return [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1412.5400000000002s)]
*  a responsible Saudi leader who will work with us rather than against us. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1423.9s)]
*  The way in which they can work against us we've just seen in stark relief. The heart of this [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1434.22s)]
*  matter is the fact that the Saudis are and will be, for the foreseeable future, the swing producer [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1441.5s)]
*  in the oil market. Even though we don't need their oil ourselves, their ability to affect the price [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1450.3s)]
*  of oil by pumping more or pumping less is something that has a fairly profound impact [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1457.98s)]
*  on our economy and on the global economy. Unless we can find a way to replace Saudi Arabia in that [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1464.3s)]
*  role, and we can discuss that but it's not simply done, we need to reach an understanding with them, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1471.5s)]
*  one that we manifestly don't have at the moment. I think it's important to look at this alternative [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1479.26s)]
*  as we do this re-evaluation of a grand compact in which we offer the Saudis a more reliable security [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1488.54s)]
*  guarantee but in return we reach understandings with them about their behaviour on all of the [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1496.86s)]
*  issues that are important in our relationship. Starting with their role of maintaining a [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1504.94s)]
*  reasonable price of oil in the oil market, reasonable today would be defined as somewhere [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1510.94s)]
*  between 80 and 90 dollars rather than the 100 to 120 dollars that they seem to want for themselves [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1516.14s)]
*  and for the Russians. We need an understanding with them about the treatment of their own people, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1522.54s)]
*  we need an understanding about Yemen, the Yemen war, we need an understanding with them about [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1528.46s)]
*  the overall approach to dealing with, deterring and containing Iran and the role that relations [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1535.42s)]
*  between Saudi Arabia and Israel should play in that effort in terms of normalizing the relationship [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1544.8600000000001s)]
*  with Israel as well. That kind of broad strategic compact seems to me, if we could achieve it, and I [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1553.02s)]
*  admit that it's a big if, would be a much better way than proceeding than essentially deciding [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1562.6200000000001s)]
*  that this relationship is hopeless and we should go our own ways. We would in the process relinquish [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1571.9s)]
*  whatever leverage we might have to deal with the human rights issues and treatment of [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1578.8600000000001s)]
*  Saudi Arabians by the regime and we would find ourselves in a, I believe, a world of hurt [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1586.3s)]
*  when it comes to the issue of the free flow of oil at reasonable prices from the Gulf. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1594.54s)]
*  I want to just finish by saying that there is an analog for where we are today and how we should [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1602.06s)]
*  proceed towards the objective that I have in mind. That analog is the reassessment that [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1609.74s)]
*  Henry Kissinger ordered that I just happened to have written about recently in 1975 when the [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1617.1000000000001s)]
*  Israelis under then Prime Minister Rabin refused a deal that he'd negotiated with the Egypt's leader [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1623.5800000000002s)]
*  Anwar Sadat and Kissinger was furious. He came home humiliated. President Ford was quote mad as [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1632.22s)]
*  hell and what did they do? I just wanted to review what they did because I think it's a good template [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1642.86s)]
*  for what we should do now. They ordered the following steps. A national security [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1650.54s)]
*  study of US interests, objectives, strategy and policy in the Middle East. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1662.3s)]
*  A review of Israel's request for 1.8 billion dollars in military assistance and 700 million [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1667.6599999999999s)]
*  economic assistance. They cancelled all upcoming visits by the Israeli defense minister and an [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1675.42s)]
*  Israeli military delegation that wanted to talk about the timeline for the provision of delivery [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1684.78s)]
*  of F-15s. They delayed the delivery of Lance missiles and laser guided bombs. They instructed [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1690.1399999999999s)]
*  each government department to curtail the privileged access that Israeli officials had [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1698.46s)]
*  enjoyed. Kissinger removed the hotline between his national security council office in the [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1704.54s)]
*  White House and the Israeli ambassador's office and President Ford issued instructions that [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1711.66s)]
*  the approach to the Israelis should be one of what he called dignified aloofness [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1720.06s)]
*  in which high level and media or high level meetings and visits were put on hold. Points [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1726.54s)]
*  of contact between the Israeli and US government officials would be channelized and strictly [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1732.46s)]
*  limited and Ford defined this as the proper relationship should be quote business like [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1737.8999999999999s)]
*  arms length and aloof and notwithstanding Congress being up in arms about this as opposed to what [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1747.9s)]
*  would be the case now in Congress is really pushing the administration to take harsher measures [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1757.3400000000001s)]
*  against the Saudis. Nevertheless they stood their ground and within three months the Israelis bent [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1762.06s)]
*  to the pressure and I think that that I've detailed that because I think it provides a very [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1773.5800000000002s)]
*  good model for the way that we should deal with the Saudis now dignified aloofness and [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1780.22s)]
*  when they need something from us we should take our time responding to it. Meanwhile [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1787.26s)]
*  engage in this serious reevaluation and we look which we look and we have government [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1794.14s)]
*  interagency process working with Congress look at the options that Senator Murphy has put on a [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1800.3s)]
*  table and Hala has put on the table and of course the one that I put on the table and do a serious [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1805.74s)]
*  study of where our interests best lie and create a degree of nervousness on the Saudi side [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1815.5s)]
*  as to what exactly we're going to do and I think that that will soften them up in a way [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1824.38s)]
*  that regardless of which approach we take we'll find them more responsive when we go back to them [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1831.42s)]
*  after we've concluded this study. Great thank you so much ambassador some great historical points [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1837.9s)]
*  and also important to raise the performative aspect of this the signaling the sort of aloofness of it [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1847.26s)]
*  we'll circle back to that. I want to turn to our panelists for some reactions but first I want to [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1853.42s)]
*  inform our audience that you can ask questions in about 15 minutes using the live chat function on [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1859.42s)]
*  YouTube or you can tweet at Carnegie and Dow. Circling back to you Senator Murphy some reactions [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1868.7s)]
*  to what the ambassador said about this notion of Mohammed bin Salman's indispensability you know we [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1876.46s)]
*  can't live with him we can't live without him and again aside from oil the the usual counter arguments [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1883.18s)]
*  that are trotted out are you know his cooperation on extremism and I think on social media you [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1889.58s)]
*  acknowledge that the Saudis have been helpful intelligence partners on that there's also the [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1896.6200000000001s)]
*  domestic jobs argument and then finally we hear China so some reactions from you to what the [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1901.1s)]
*  ambassador said and to these issues. Yeah I don't know that I argue for a divorce but it is something [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1907.6599999999999s)]
*  more akin to a to a you're certainly not sleeping in the same bed any longer right and to me as you [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1916.2199999999998s)]
*  point out Fred there are incredibly important elements to this relationship it is absolutely [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1926.06s)]
*  true we are going to continue to be reliant for the foreseeable future on the product Saudi Arabia [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1931.34s)]
*  produces we are you know a decade maybe a little bit shorter away from you know being able to [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1937.34s)]
*  you know truly be a nation that is you know by and large energy independent that security cooperation [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1943.34s)]
*  is important I give credit to Mohammed bin Salman for the progress he has made on shutting down the [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1949.74s)]
*  pathways to fund a lot of these extremist groups and as much as the campaign of repression has been [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1955.34s)]
*  dizzying you know there are obviously some freedoms enjoyed inside the kingdom access to [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1961.74s)]
*  entertainment for instance that were not there years ago so to me this is you know about a [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1968.54s)]
*  you know about an understanding in which our cooperation is going to be perhaps more targeted [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1977.6599999999999s)]
*  and more intermittent rather than systematic and I guess you know I have such respect for [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1983.1s)]
*  Martin and his views he's right far more often than I am on any of these topics I guess I would [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1993.1s)]
*  take the deal that Martin's lying laying down if I thought it existed that does sound like a really [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=1999.6599999999999s)]
*  good deal if we could get the Saudis to you know full accountability for Khashoggi and make reforms [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2005.34s)]
*  that none of that would happen again and get out of Yemen keep the price of oil below a certain [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2013.6599999999999s)]
*  number you know that probably is a deal worth taking I think my the reason I come down in a [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2019.1s)]
*  different place is not because I don't think that that's a potentially good outcome for the [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2026.22s)]
*  United States but because I don't think it's possible because I think MBS has shown us that [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2031.02s)]
*  you know his campaign of domestic repression his sort of need to be a regional bully is [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2038.46s)]
*  definitional for him and so to me we have to deal with the leader we have [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2045.74s)]
*  and somebody said well why did MBS make this decision you know what what logic is there to [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2054.62s)]
*  sort of commit to the administration that you're going to do x and then surprise them and do y and [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2059.1s)]
*  I think the answer is you can't ever really explain why MBS makes decisions it's quixotic [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2063.74s)]
*  it's based on how he feels that day and so when you're thinking about a broad strategic lasting [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2071.5s)]
*  partnership in which on a daily basis you're doing something for me and I'm doing something for you [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2078.06s)]
*  you have to have a reliable partner the Saudis used to be that reliable partner I mean it was [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2082.2999999999997s)]
*  different right you weren't dealing with one leader you were dealing with you know multiple [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2087.18s)]
*  power centers it was easier for the United States to in some ways to manage the relationship when [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2091.66s)]
*  the leadership was more complex but today it's not complex today it's one man and I think that that [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2097.5s)]
*  makes that sort of grand bargain harder on the question of China so I think we have to be [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2105.18s)]
*  I think we generally have to be careful about the sort of straw man argument of well if we [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2115.42s)]
*  don't support this regime China will come in because that's an answer to do business with [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2121.5s)]
*  you know every dirty dictator around the world I think there are two reasons to be a little careful [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2127.1800000000003s)]
*  about the question of who will fill the vacuum it is true it used to be that we worried about Russia [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2132.38s)]
*  and China filling the vacuum in Saudi Arabia today Russia is not going to be a reliable security [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2138.62s)]
*  partner so we're talking mainly about the Chinese the Chinese you know systems are still are getting [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2143.18s)]
*  better every day they are still not as good as the US systems the you know HQ 9s are nice the [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2149.3399999999997s)]
*  you know the QW 12s are impressive but patriots are still best of class it would be a big decision [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2156.14s)]
*  for the Saudis to turn their backs on US security cooperation and I also you know just think there's [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2162.7799999999997s)]
*  a limit to how much of the security environment China wants to own in the region they got a great [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2169.74s)]
*  deal right now they got a great deal right the US protects the oil and China gets the benefit [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2175.8199999999997s)]
*  so I think there's a point at which China will say well you know not exactly willing to step in [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2182.2999999999997s)]
*  and put 3 000 troops on the ground if the United States pulls out and I think the Saudis know that [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2187.1s)]
*  so I do think there's a reason when it when it comes to sort of the threat of being replaced [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2192.06s)]
*  um to you know maybe be a little bit more confident about calling bluffs [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2197.42s)]
*  Great thank you so much um Dr. Hallett you know turning to you and your actions to ambassadors [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2205.1s)]
*  uh you know proposal again Mohammed bin Salman he's going to be in power for a long time [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2212.14s)]
*  you know from the US perspective Washington has given him chances to sort of reciprocate [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2217.9s)]
*  we haven't seen that so so what next you know what what tools do we have have there been instances [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2223.5s)]
*  in the past where pressure has been applied where conditionality has been used that actually makes [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2228.8599999999997s)]
*  an impact domestically inside you know Saudi Arabia and again going back to my original question [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2233.8199999999997s)]
*  what more can the US you know do? I think I would agree cautiously with Ambassador Indic [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2238.7799999999997s)]
*  um need for a study um you do not want to be faced with such political uh you know upheaval [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2247.34s)]
*  every year because of someone who cannot be controlled who cannot be deterred I would say [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2258.46s)]
*  a good investment is uh why recognizing that yes uh the current situation um uh you know today [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2265.82s)]
*  is that we have someone you know with an absolute control of every resources inside Saudi Arabia [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2274.4599999999996s)]
*  and using those kinds of resources in an irresponsible and unreliable way [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2280.9399999999996s)]
*  that affects both nations or basically Saudis and the region I would highlight also that there are [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2285.4199999999996s)]
*  successive stories that happened um like for instance ending the siege of Qatar for instance [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2291.8999999999996s)]
*  that happened to the benefit of the region and allowed Qatar to be more of an active regional [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2299.1s)]
*  player again instead of being isolated and having these kinds of unnecessary situations and also the [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2303.9s)]
*  role of the um uh US envoy to Yemen uh in facilitating the truce and facilitating you know [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2310.38s)]
*  some kinds of a ceasefire at least to help the people uh not successful so far but it is helpful [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2317.66s)]
*  also to um to have these kinds of prisons uh again one thing that that I think um is [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2324.22s)]
*  irreplaceable in this discussion what kind of Saudi Arabia the world and the US and the people [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2331.5s)]
*  of Saudi Arabia wants to see it is not Saudi Arabia that is ruled uh you know in a such uh [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2336.62s)]
*  in a such an unpredictable and brutal way that doesn't um really plays well in the world politics [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2342.22s)]
*  and in the region so I guess the good the good answer to that is how much the US is invested in [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2349.82s)]
*  supporting and protecting a thriving civil society within Saudi Arabia and in the region [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2357.6600000000003s)]
*  and you can't really be selective you cannot really force a US view on the people of the region [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2363.26s)]
*  you cannot say that we need um you know some kinds of relationship with Israel and Saudi Arabia [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2369.42s)]
*  regardless of the uh festering problems that exist and ignore it in this kind of you know [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2375.42s)]
*  peace treaties or relationship or normalization I think we need more uh than this to have some [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2381.5s)]
*  kind of a meaningful and embraced reforms from the people as well um so again thinking about the [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2387.9s)]
*  people um I I get to see for instance a success story when Lujain al-Hadloul one of the most [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2394.62s)]
*  prominent women's women's rights activists have been released uh you know shortly after the Biden [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2400.54s)]
*  administration um you know resumed their residency so this is a successful story where solidarity [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2406.22s)]
*  worked but unfortunately her role and her influence in the Saudi community despite how popular she was [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2412.62s)]
*  has been uh ended basically I want to quote also a story uh from a friend an activist in Kuwait [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2419.1s)]
*  who said that when um Saudi Arabia and the allied European nation including the US [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2426.14s)]
*  tried to um help the Kuwaitis uh restore uh you know from the invasion of Iraq they decided to have [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2433.02s)]
*  you know a condition that for the Kuwaiti government to be reinstated back in Kuwait [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2443.42s)]
*  they needed to have a form of an institution or a constitution of basically uh sitting in place [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2449.02s)]
*  that this is not only up to one person one royal family to decide for millions of people and this [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2454.94s)]
*  is what happened and now we're seeing the impact of that you're not dealing in Kuwait with one [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2460.78s)]
*  entity you're dealing with a you know a thriving constitution it's not like it's flourishing or any [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2465.02s)]
*  or any uh you know well-functioning democracy but at least it's a form of governance that puts some [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2472.3s)]
*  kinds of balances and checks on political decision making it makes people represented in a way and [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2478.78s)]
*  it makes it better for um the government the good governance of Kuwait to happen and this is the only [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2484.38s)]
*  um it's like you know 30 years or more in the making but it is one of the only gulf monarchies [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2490.62s)]
*  that have this form of uh you know representation and participation and I think this is something [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2497.7400000000002s)]
*  that has to be part of any effort to deal with existing with an existing unwanted reality inside [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2504.38s)]
*  Saudi Arabia is what can we do to have more of a representation more of a responsible [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2510.78s)]
*  and democratic transition within Saudi Arabia. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2517.98s)]
*  Great thank you and thanks for bringing the example of Kuwait into this uh Ambassador Indyk I want to [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2523.1000000000004s)]
*  turn it over to you for reactions and I guess specifically you know how do we [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2528.38s)]
*  operationalize this notion of of aloofness I mean we've seen this before where there's been [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2532.38s)]
*  pauses you know senior officials have not gone to meetings and I think the gulf states have gotten [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2536.94s)]
*  used to this they've waited it out so you know again we've sort of seen this before and I guess [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2541.98s)]
*  walk us through the specifics of you know your idea in a bit more detail. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2546.3s)]
*  Well as I said I think the template is is the one that Kissinger and Ford established um and we take [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2553.5s)]
*  down meetings we keep them at arm's length we hold up arm supplies I think congress is already [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2560.7s)]
*  essentially doing that there may not be any new new sales anticipated but but that is the general [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2567.66s)]
*  the general approach they feel are cold shoulder uh sooner rather than later they're going to [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2575.3399999999997s)]
*  um come face to face with the reality which is that Saudi Arabia is sitting on this huge amount [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2582.54s)]
*  of oil and cannot defend it they cannot defend themselves they've bought all these arms but they [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2593.02s)]
*  don't have the ability to do that and and at a certain point I don't know sooner rather than [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2601.9s)]
*  later the hoodies they've already uh refused to extend the the troops and who knows they're [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2608.86s)]
*  going to start firing their rockets again or their their drones and so on and and what are the Saudis [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2615.34s)]
*  going to do um they've got their own patriots uh but they they really depend on us to defend them [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2621.98s)]
*  and and I think part of their problem is they're not sure that they can rely on us [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2630.94s)]
*  to defend them and that's why I think it's important that we make it clear that that we [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2636.06s)]
*  are willing to do so if they are willing to behave differently um but in the meantime I think that [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2641.7400000000002s)]
*  that we need to be uh as I said keep them at arm's length and keep them wondering what exactly it is [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2649.58s)]
*  we're going to do now you know to respond to Senator Murphy I mean he makes I think [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2657.9s)]
*  a very good point the track record of of Mohammed bin Salman is one of of strategic blunder after [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2666.62s)]
*  strategic blunder he just made another one taking Saudi Arabia in the war in Yemen [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2675.7400000000002s)]
*  Yemen was a disastrous blunder ordering the the dismemberment of Jamal Khachati was yet another [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2682.62s)]
*  blunder um and and he's prone to this because of his headstrong uh and fairly ruthless approach [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2691.66s)]
*  to the challenges that he faces um so you know I think that that that is a reality that we're [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2702.62s)]
*  dealing with um and the problem I have with with adopting um I don't know what Senator Murphy would [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2711.5s)]
*  set up be satisfied with a separation um rather than a divorce uh whatever that is it ends up in [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2719.98s)]
*  a divorce um we we that because the problems in the relationship failing to address those problems [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2726.78s)]
*  head-on and coming to some understanding will mean that those problems will plague the relationship [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2735.18s)]
*  to to the point where uh divorce becomes kind of inevitable and we're headed in that direction now [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2742.54s)]
*  um you know Congress is going to act in in all sorts of ways that are going to accelerate that [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2749.8999999999996s)]
*  and and uh the Saudis seem to be hell bent on following their very parochial interest [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2757.58s)]
*  in in the price of oil in a very cynical way oh it's just it's just going to build one itself so [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2765.2599999999998s)]
*  so I think before we go down that road we need to try uh the alternative of trying to come to an [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2772.7799999999997s)]
*  understanding uh on a comprehensive understanding of all these issues maybe it can't be achieved [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2782.3799999999997s)]
*  and then we've got to think about how we protect ourselves from from the consequences [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2790.14s)]
*  of Saudi Arabia aligning itself with Russia in OPEC plus and and engaging in in oil pricing [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2797.26s)]
*  policies that can be very damaging to us and to the global economy um that that need we need to [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2803.5s)]
*  do a study of that as well but in my view we at least need to give this a good college try [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2810.62s)]
*  and see if we can come to an understanding um and and then if not there'll be plenty of opportunity [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2817.02s)]
*  to to uh let them go their own way [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2823.74s)]
*  great thank you um I do want to open it up for questions for our panelists to the audience to [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2830.2999999999997s)]
*  ask a question again you can um use the live chat feature on YouTube or um tweet uh to the hashtag [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2835.8199999999997s)]
*  ask Carnegie um we're still waiting for um some questions so Senator Murphy uh let me turn it over [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2844.62s)]
*  to you for some more reactions and I guess specifically you know you mentioned we shouldn't [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2853.98s)]
*  just make this a tactical you know readjustment and how do we avoid that I mean how do we really [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2860.38s)]
*  send a signal this time because we've seen these sorts of pauses before and again drilling down [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2865.2599999999998s)]
*  into to certain assets right certain systems certain things we have on the ground there [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2869.9s)]
*  how can those be used to send the appropriate uh signal sure um I think you know Ambassador [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2874.62s)]
*  Indig is is is right the Saudis do not trust um that should there be a need for a very robust [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2882.7s)]
*  defense of the kingdom that the United States will be there there are reasons for that but um [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2891.66s)]
*  you know I think they look um you know they they look to 2019 you know their best friend in the [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2897.42s)]
*  world Donald Trump um sort of offered no response to the you know massive attack by Iran on the [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2903.42s)]
*  Aramco facility and they think to themselves well boy if Donald Trump who put his hands on the orb [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2913.02s)]
*  uh isn't you know coming to our defense here then you know how can we expect anyone in the White [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2919.02s)]
*  House to do so so I I understand you know the the the nature of the Saudi skepticism towards [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2925.34s)]
*  us right now um you know again I put this in in this broader context um you know which is why I [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2932.94s)]
*  think I I worry about the um the the potential fallout of a agreement right um because I think [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2940.54s)]
*  we have seen evidence that this particular leader is willing to use U.S. security assistance in a [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2952.22s)]
*  way that previous leaders weren't um and we just don't need any more conflicts any more destabilizing [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2958.62s)]
*  activity on our hands in the region than we already have and whether it's the kidnapping of [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2965.74s)]
*  the Lebanese prime minister or you know this just nonsensical war uh in Yemen or the you know fight [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2970.7s)]
*  with Qatar that you know um was just disastrous for for all of us I I worry that we're just in for [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2978.38s)]
*  more of that and that you know more security aid to to Riyadh which would be in the name of defending [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2986.46s)]
*  Riyadh is going to ultimately find its way into another Yemen um I think we're also at a moment [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2993.42s)]
*  where we're you know we're in a we're in a fight for the future of democracy and I have been more [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=2999.7400000000002s)]
*  broadly critical of this administration in its Middle East policy I I think Saudi Arabia is not [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3004.38s)]
*  alone in meriting more attention from the United States when it comes to human rights record I do [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3009.98s)]
*  not understand why um we continue to be in such robust security business with the Egyptians when [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3015.26s)]
*  they have you know tens of thousands of political prisoners locked up and I care about all of this [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3022.54s)]
*  because I think more than ever before it matters today whether the United States is both walking [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3028.2200000000003s)]
*  the walk and talking the talk on democracy and human rights you know back in the cold war you [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3034.3s)]
*  know it it the the choice was so bipolar the Soviets were you know such an unappetizing partner [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3040.78s)]
*  that it just um wasn't a fair fight in many ways but today um illiberal democracy um is a really [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3048.54s)]
*  attractive model um and the more that America's support for democracy and and human rights becomes [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3056.78s)]
*  corrupted by our very close alliance with countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia that [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3064.14s)]
*  are getting worse when it comes to their human rights record I think it becomes a lot harder [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3069.5s)]
*  to rally the world around a set of values that we don't share um with many of our closest partners [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3073.74s)]
*  so I I also think that this is just a moment in time where we've got to be a little bit more [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3080.22s)]
*  cold-blooded um about um the way in which we marry our rhetoric on human rights and democracy with our [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3085.2599999999998s)]
*  with our our action um but I mean listen if if if if there's a chance that that that that um [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3092.94s)]
*  that agreement you know could be reached with the Saudis and I think it would have to involve real [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3101.26s)]
*  political reform domestically for it to be worthwhile then listen I'm I'm certainly open [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3105.82s)]
*  to that to that dialogue and I mean maybe what you're hearing between Martin and I is just to [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3113.02s)]
*  maybe disagreement on the um you know the the belief we have in it ultimately uh ultimately [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3118.22s)]
*  succeeding [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3125.74s)]
*  Great thank you um we've got one question from our audience um and again I think this has [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3129.42s)]
*  been well covered in the media again Saudi officials argue that the OPEC plus decision was [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3136.62s)]
*  merely economic and to prevent a potential collapse in the oil price again is this analysis [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3142.8599999999997s)]
*  completely wrong and and again we've seen this line you know being trotted out and again I'll [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3147.5s)]
*  add to that that the Saudis appear you know now to be pointing to the aid that they've given to [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3153.42s)]
*  Ukraine the prisoners swap and so you know this and then the narrative also you hear is they're [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3158.38s)]
*  not a vassal state anymore and so you know there's a certain nationalism in their in their discourse [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3163.9s)]
*  that comes out along with the economic angle to this so any one of our panelists [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3170.3s)]
*  jump in yeah sure sure sure um because I think that that this is this is the [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3177.98s)]
*  the Saudi justification but I think it it it misses a whole lot of facts the first one being [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3184.94s)]
*  that President Biden went to Saudi Arabia to effect a reconciliation with the crown prince [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3192.78s)]
*  despite a lot of criticism from from his own party for doing that reached an understanding [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3199.26s)]
*  with Mohammed bin Salman in which the crown prince committed to increasing production of oil [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3207.82s)]
*  over the next few months to the end of the year to 750,000 barrels a day that was the [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3217.74s)]
*  commitment that the crown prince made when the president was there and but there was an [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3225.98s)]
*  agreement not to announce the details but that was the commitment and you recall that the [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3231.9s)]
*  president came out and said that the Saudis have agreed to increase production and and [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3238.38s)]
*  they didn't live up to that commitment so that's that's point number one point number two okay [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3246.78s)]
*  circumstances change they appear the crown prince appears to have been panicked if you can believe [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3253.34s)]
*  the story by his oil minister in step brother older stepbrother Abdul Aziz bin Salman who told [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3260.22s)]
*  him as they were considering the budget that the price of oil was likely to drop to 50 40 dollars [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3267.8999999999996s)]
*  even and they wouldn't be able to pay for MBS's vision 2030 dreams of development for Saudi [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3275.4199999999996s)]
*  Arabia and so MBS turned around said okay well we're gonna we're gonna cut oil that's the case [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3284.7s)]
*  so they were focused very proactively on on you know their economic self-interest without considering [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3292.22s)]
*  the impact that that would have not only on their commitment to the president of the United States [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3301.66s)]
*  but the impact on the effort to sanction Russia and and reduce its oil revenues at a critical [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3306.94s)]
*  moment as Europe's going into winter and and being screwed by Putin and he's bombing [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3315.66s)]
*  civilians in Ukraine and and that unwillingness to take into account the the bigger picture [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3323.8199999999997s)]
*  all the relationship with the United States is is highly problematic strategically I think a big [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3331.18s)]
*  mistake for Saudi Arabia but but in terms of the relationship with the United States an indication [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3338.94s)]
*  of a lack of regard now having said all of that and I think it's important just to [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3345.2599999999998s)]
*  people for people who understand the administration responded by saying okay let's hold off and see [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3352.3799999999997s)]
*  maybe you're right that the price is going to drop we'll come in and support the price by [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3360.14s)]
*  buying for buying up oil for the strategic petroleum reserve to maintain the price if [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3367.2599999999998s)]
*  you're right and it's about to drop we don't believe it's going to drop but you know we'll [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3373.2599999999998s)]
*  give you some somewhat of a guarantee in that regard and this was brokered by Mohammed bin Zayed [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3377.98s)]
*  the Emirati president who wanted to increase production and he went to the Saudis sent [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3386.22s)]
*  Sheikh Tafnul to the Saudis to try to persuade them to go along with this not so that it could [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3392.3799999999997s)]
*  buy the Democrats up a month before the elections but because there was so much more riding on this [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3399.74s)]
*  riding on this when it came to the war in Ukraine and and squeezing the Russians and and [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3406.22s)]
*  MBS said no so you know I just don't buy this kind of argument that it was just about [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3415.8999999999996s)]
*  looking out for their for their economic interests they had broader strategic interests [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3423.74s)]
*  they had an alternative they had a commitment to the United States [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3429.5s)]
*  this is also a critical moment in the fight in Ukraine you know you you obviously have [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3434.62s)]
*  some very dangerous saber rattling happening from Vladimir Putin but you also have the diplomatic [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3444.22s)]
*  walls closing on him a bit right more public reproachment from partners like China and India [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3448.54s)]
*  a terrible result in the general assembly sort of showing that there's a lack of patience in [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3458.1400000000003s)]
*  many parts of the world and so you know this was a this is a month in which you know there was an [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3464.06s)]
*  ability to send a consistent message to Putin that your friends are vanishing and now is the time to [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3469.6600000000003s)]
*  figure out a path out of this and so you know I think that that is the other piece of this is [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3477.82s)]
*  that the timing of this this and I don't want to overstate you know the impact on Russia Russia's [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3483.98s)]
*  still selling a lot of you know oil around the world partners but this this sort of lifeline [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3490.22s)]
*  to Russia came at a particularly bad time and if I might add something also so what we're seeing [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3495.26s)]
*  from the Saudi aid to Ukraine which is enormous afterwards really is not you know falling within [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3502.7s)]
*  this kind of economic justification so if Saudi Arabia is worried about its own economic situation [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3511.9s)]
*  why are we seeing this enormous aid being paid while they could have paid you know we could [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3517.1s)]
*  have helped in a different way without having to not that I'm against the aid but again this is [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3523.82s)]
*  something that doesn't show you know economic limitations and also the money that is being paid [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3529.98s)]
*  for PR and consultancy for all of the other things I think in terms of economy these are not [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3535.7400000000002s)]
*  actions that would support a limited economy or a limited economic situation [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3541.58s)]
*  very good point this is the last question I'll direct it to [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3547.74s)]
*  Senator Murphy how would a sustained cooling of US-Saudi relations affect the GCC and US security [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3551.66s)]
*  cooperation with the other Gulf states well I think as you as you heard you know Martin [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3559.74s)]
*  explain you know there there has been noticeably different behavior by the Emiratis and the Saudis [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3565.9s)]
*  I think the Emiratis are very good at public relations and often get maybe a little bit more [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3575.34s)]
*  credit for some of the things they've done in the region than they might deserve [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3582.3s)]
*  they made a big public show of pulling out of Yemen query how far out the Emiratis really are [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3586.62s)]
*  of Yemen but there's no doubt that there is and you've obviously seen what the Qataris have done [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3595.3399999999997s)]
*  in part because they were forced to draw closer to the United States because of the break between [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3603.02s)]
*  the Emiratis the Saudis and the Qataris but there are all sorts of signs that if there was a bit [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3607.98s)]
*  more of a transactional intermittent relationship with the Saudis other nations in the region may [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3615.18s)]
*  be willing to step up and offer a greater level of cooperation and so I don't think it's an all [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3622.38s)]
*  or nothing proposition in which if you you know decide to pull some troops out of Saudi Arabia [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3631.42s)]
*  and again I hear Martin's counsel that this is sort of heading in the direction of divorce and [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3637.34s)]
*  even if you don't intend for it that may end up where you go and I'll internalize that and [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3644.54s)]
*  think about it because I think we want to be careful not to set in motion something we don't [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3650.38s)]
*  intend at the same time I think there is a potential that there would be other partners that [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3653.98s)]
*  would fill some of the of the political vacuum at least though there are other partners simply [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3659.98s)]
*  don't have the resources that Saudi Arabia does when it comes to the contribution to OPEC oil output [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3665.9s)]
*  Thank you senator unfortunately we have run out of time I want to thank all three of you for a very [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3673.9s)]
*  rich and illuminating discussion it certainly isn't the end of the debate and we look forward [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3679.34s)]
*  to hearing from all three of you in the future and thank you also to our audience for joining [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaUje4nGdH4&t=3684.7000000000003s)]
