# Reimagining the Public Sector in the Middle East and Central Asia
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [January 09, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg)
*  to our audience here and also to those joining us by live stream. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=0.0s)]
*  My name is Michelle Dunn. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4.3s)]
*  I direct the Middle East program here at Carnegie in Washington. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5.54s)]
*  Our subject today is Rethinking the Public Sector in the Middle East and Central Asia. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=10.02s)]
*  And the occasion of our discussion is a new report on public wage bills in the Middle East [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=16.28s)]
*  and Central Asia by the International Monetary Fund, which is cosponsoring this event. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=22.26s)]
*  And I thank the IMF for choosing Carnegie to do this event today. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=28.259999999999998s)]
*  Copies of the report are available here and I understand it's either [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=32.92s)]
*  up on the IMF website or will be shortly. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=37.22s)]
*  So this report tackles a long-running problem in the economies of the Middle East [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=40.56s)]
*  and the Central Asia regions. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=46.54s)]
*  And the regions we're talking about today cover from Kazakhstan in the east to Morocco in the west. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=48.68s)]
*  Now the situation regarding the public sector, public sector employment [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=55.63999999999999s)]
*  and wage bills differs of course from country to country. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=59.919999999999995s)]
*  But the general picture is that governments are spending a lot on public sector wages [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=63.12s)]
*  without necessarily getting good results in terms of services provided to citizens. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=69.16s)]
*  Moreover, changing world energy markets and changing revenues available particularly [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=75.25999999999999s)]
*  to oil producers make these wage bills unsustainable in some cases. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=81.64s)]
*  So how can this situation be amended? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=87.02s)]
*  Without of course causing widespread hardship and instability. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=89.52s)]
*  So these issues are very controversial and today we're going to hear a diversity of views [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=94.38s)]
*  about how they should be addressed. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=99.56s)]
*  We're going to hear new ideas from the IMF and then we're going to hear what others [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=101.64s)]
*  from civil society and so forth think about it as well. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  So here's our plan for the next 90 minutes. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=111.02s)]
*  First we're going to have some framing remarks by Mr. Daozhong [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=115.06s)]
*  who is Deputy Managing Director of the IMF. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=119.48s)]
*  Then Mr. Jihad Azur who is Director for the Middle East and Central Asia Department [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=122.86s)]
*  of the IMF is going to present the main findings of the report. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=128.48s)]
*  And after that I'm going to moderate a conversation about the report with Jihad as well [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=132.82s)]
*  as with two expert commentators, Ms. Teresa Ter-Manassian who's a consultant [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=138.44s)]
*  and a former Director of the Fiscal Affairs Department of the IMF and Ms. Amy Akhdaoui [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=144.1s)]
*  who's a consultant specializing in civil society and civic engagement formerly [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=149.88s)]
*  of the Bank Information Center. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  And of course we'll reserve the last part of our event for questions [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=157.56s)]
*  from the audience for our panel. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=162.67999999999998s)]
*  So Dr. Jihad, I welcome you to the podium to make your remarks. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=165.04s)]
*  Thank you, Michelle. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  And good afternoon everyone. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm very pleased to be here and of course I welcome you once again to today's event. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=182.45999999999998s)]
*  I would also like to take these opportunities to express my appreciation to Carnegie's [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=190.24s)]
*  for hosting this event and particularly to Michelle for assembling such a wonderful panel [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=197.10000000000002s)]
*  and also for moderating later on today's discussion. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  So here at Carnegie today we are launching a paper, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=212.2s)]
*  the paper examining the management of public reach barrels in the Middle East and Central Asia. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=221.73999999999998s)]
*  As you know the paper was prepared by the team of my IMF colleagues led by Natalia, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=229.38s)]
*  Tamreza and Chris Duneward. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=242.01999999999998s)]
*  So why we care about this subject? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  Globally spending on public reaches absorbs around one-fifth [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=251.42s)]
*  of total government spending on average. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=257.74s)]
*  So that's a skill. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=261.86s)]
*  Clearly this has important fiscal and macroeconomic consequences. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=263.3s)]
*  Moreover, the efficiencies of public reach spending as well [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=271.5s)]
*  as other public services is crucial for the economy of any kind of countries, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=276.22s)]
*  being it advanced, emerging markets or low income. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=286.18s)]
*  So such a policy are essential to achieve strong, sustainable and inclusive growth. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=292.44s)]
*  I think that's the starting point. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=300.11999999999995s)]
*  Our previous work has shown the process [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=304.88s)]
*  of reforming public reach barrels actually can be quite complicated and time consuming. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=309.59999999999997s)]
*  It requires robust institutions and considerable political will. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=318.96s)]
*  So more importantly, reform in this regard have a better chance [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=325.14s)]
*  of achieving sustainable success when they are part [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=332.06s)]
*  of the longer term broad based structural reforms to the economy. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=337.02s)]
*  So this will be more effective than just addressing short term measures [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=345.4s)]
*  such as freezes on reaches or higher. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=352.68s)]
*  So this paper we're going to launch today looks at this topic, you know, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=359.4s)]
*  through the lengths of Middle East and Central Asia. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=364.74s)]
*  And this region, as you know, where policy makers are grappling with challenges related [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=370.12s)]
*  to public sectors, employment and reaches. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=377.68s)]
*  And of course, addressing them here will also have important implications [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=382.44s)]
*  for economic welfare more broadly, not just confined to this region alone. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=390.44s)]
*  So let me mention some of the challenges facing this region just briefly. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=398.08s)]
*  First, some countries are experiencing weak growth and higher unemployment. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=406.6s)]
*  With large number of the young people entering immense, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=415.52s)]
*  entering the job market each year, this has put the pressures on government [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=419.96s)]
*  to find a way to generate jobs. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=427.26s)]
*  So that's the first challenge. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=429.84s)]
*  Second, many countries are facing a difficult budget environment, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=432.4s)]
*  partly due to low oil prices and falling foreign exchange remittance. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=440.0s)]
*  And third, demands to improve the delivery of the public services are increasing. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=450.41999999999996s)]
*  But these services have fallen short of public expectations, and you can see [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=457.36s)]
*  that in many countries in the regions. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=465.32s)]
*  Finally, internal and regional conflicts have presented the challenges [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=469.54s)]
*  of managing unprecedented flows of refugees, migrants, and internally displaced people. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=475.72s)]
*  So this placed immense burdens on government services across the regions [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=484.56s)]
*  and further strength budget resources. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=490.92s)]
*  So this is not an issue just on public which bill per se, this is a broader issue [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=495.5s)]
*  or as a part of the broader packages of reforms. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=502.94s)]
*  So with that, what do we do? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=507.94s)]
*  And we can reflect it in the papers. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=513.02s)]
*  One of the key findings in this paper is that public which bills in Middle East [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=520.04s)]
*  and Central Asia are high compared to other regions. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=528.86s)]
*  In terms of the numbers, average public which bills amount to 10% of GDP, while others, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=534.3000000000001s)]
*  if you compare with other regions, which is only 6% [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=544.5s)]
*  in the similar country circumstances outside the regions. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=549.0600000000001s)]
*  So we can see that this carries even stronger significance in terms [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=555.36s)]
*  of the macroeconomic policy implications. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=563.64s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=569.6s)]
*  And this is partly a legacy in the past, reflecting the prevalence [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=571.4399999999999s)]
*  of state-driven economic models in many of the countries in the regions. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=579.3399999999999s)]
*  Government too often act as an employer of first resort. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=586.28s)]
*  And public sector jobs serves as social support. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=595.9799999999999s)]
*  Of course, these strains of resources that could have been put [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=602.54s)]
*  to more effective use elsewhere. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=607.92s)]
*  For example, in oil exporting countries, we have seen governments attempting [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=616.3s)]
*  to maintain social cohesion by offering high levels [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=625.14s)]
*  of compensations compared to the private sector. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=630.22s)]
*  Though obviously, this has distorted labor markets and competitiveness. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=635.68s)]
*  In addition, the political instabilities and conflict across the regions means [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=643.46s)]
*  that the security related employment is on the rise. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=651.22s)]
*  This clearly can have implications for public wage bills. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=657.34s)]
*  So while we're talking about more on the Middle East, certainly the challenges [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=665.92s)]
*  of managing public wage bills also are difficult issues in the Caucasus and Central Asia. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=675.62s)]
*  Public employment remains high in these countries despite slower government hiring [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=685.8199999999999s)]
*  during the transitions to the market-based economies during the last 25 years. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=695.02s)]
*  So with all of these challenges, what are these policy responses? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=701.06s)]
*  So this is a paper I tried to look for. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=708.42s)]
*  I will leave it for the moment to other speakers and panelists for discussions later on [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=713.2199999999999s)]
*  to details on the recommendations. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=721.54s)]
*  But for now, allow me to offer into a bigger picture. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=724.46s)]
*  That is the government's need to pursue wage bill policies that are physically sustainable [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=731.78s)]
*  and focused on providing effective and equitable public services. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=741.22s)]
*  So that's the bottom line. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=749.22s)]
*  Reforming, we believe, reforming public wage bills can make room for spending [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=751.0600000000001s)]
*  that enhance inclusive growth, including enhance the social protections [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=759.3000000000001s)]
*  and in the meanwhile provide higher and fairer growth in the Middle East and Central Asia. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=766.7s)]
*  Of course, this requires a broad base of reforms that are sequenced and designed [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=775.1s)]
*  to work in synergies between each other. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=781.46s)]
*  So I hope this paper and together today's discussions will stimulate the debate [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=787.9s)]
*  on this important topic by all the parties. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=797.26s)]
*  So as a matter of fact, we at the IMF, in the process of preparing the paper, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=801.58s)]
*  have already benefited quite significantly from the dialogue [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=807.22s)]
*  with civil society and labor unions. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=811.82s)]
*  Our fundamental objective is to motivate better public service delivery. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=818.58s)]
*  And this in turn, of course, we believe, can support the broader reform needed [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=827.98s)]
*  to increase private sector employment across the regions. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=834.9s)]
*  And of course, by doing that, boost sustainable and inclusive growth. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=839.86s)]
*  So I look forward to our discussion later today and hope it will deepen our understanding [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=847.02s)]
*  on all of these important issues. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=855.66s)]
*  And with that, let me hand over the floor to Jihad for the presentation of the paper. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=858.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=866.38s)]
*  Well, good afternoon. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=867.7s)]
*  Also, I would like to thank you, Michelle, as well as also Carnegie, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=881.34s)]
*  for hosting us this afternoon to present this paper. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=886.9s)]
*  Also, I would like to seize this opportunity to thank Amy and Teresa for accepting [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=891.22s)]
*  to participate as a discussion of the paper. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=897.0600000000001s)]
*  And to thanks my colleague who prepared this paper and reviewed the paper, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=900.62s)]
*  Natalia Christoff and Asim who reviewed the paper. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=906.34s)]
*  Amy, Michelle in her introductory remarks said that this is a longstanding issue. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=911.94s)]
*  It's indeed a longstanding issue. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=921.4200000000001s)]
*  And the question is why we are considering that this is an important issue today [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=923.0600000000001s)]
*  and why now we believe that it's important to reform the wage bill. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=929.5400000000001s)]
*  And above all, how to do it, i.e. how to do it in a way that addresses the root cause [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=936.1s)]
*  of the problem as well as also achieve the objective of improving government functioning [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=944.82s)]
*  and create more inclusiveness in the way growth is being run. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=951.22s)]
*  Therefore, excuse me, technology, okay. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=956.14s)]
*  Why? It's definitely a longstanding issue. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=973.46s)]
*  It has been with the region despite the differences in countries in terms of size, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=976.58s)]
*  in terms of geographical location for decades. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=982.54s)]
*  It's one of the structural weaknesses that the region is facing in addition to low growth, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=986.18s)]
*  lack of inclusiveness and high level of unemployment. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=993.06s)]
*  Therefore, those structural weaknesses that have been here and led in some of the countries [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=997.8199999999999s)]
*  to the recent developments that we saw over the last seven or eight years, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1005.5s)]
*  and those structural issues get exacerbated or aggravated by the shocks [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1011.38s)]
*  that the region has to face over the last decade starting [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1018.86s)]
*  from the international financial crisis to the Arab uprising in 2011 and more recently [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1023.0200000000001s)]
*  to the sudden and sustainable drop in oil prices. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1030.8600000000001s)]
*  Therefore, the region in the last 10 years was in addition to the structural issues subjected [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1033.74s)]
*  to some number of shocks. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1039.82s)]
*  What the region was able to do is to sustain, and this is in fact was one of the strengths [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1042.46s)]
*  of the region, the ability to weather the storm and sustain the shocks, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1047.78s)]
*  yet the region was not able to fastly recover, address inclusiveness issues, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1053.18s)]
*  create enough growth that will trickle down to various groups in the society. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1059.86s)]
*  Therefore, structural weaknesses in addition to the shocks are more and more requiring [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1064.46s)]
*  that some policies need to be adjusted in order to deal with those issues. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1071.7s)]
*  Therefore, if we want to achieve inclusive growth, if we want to address the level [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1078.54s)]
*  of unemployment that in some of the countries is above 12% and for the youth above 25 to 30%, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1084.22s)]
*  we need to do some changes. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1092.5s)]
*  And those changes are at more than one level and need to be articulated together. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1094.82s)]
*  Of course, addressing long-term issues requires structural reforms [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1101.3799999999999s)]
*  and also requires improving governance. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1105.4599999999998s)]
*  But also, the fiscal can play. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1108.54s)]
*  The fiscal can play by creating additional fiscal space, which means make some savings [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1111.6599999999999s)]
*  that will be used to address some of the social issues that could be used in order [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1119.02s)]
*  to invest in infrastructure to increase productivity in the economy and create additional jobs. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1124.06s)]
*  Therefore, what this paper is about is to show that reforming the wage bill [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1129.94s)]
*  will definitely help create additional fiscal space that is needed for those countries, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1135.1399999999999s)]
*  especially for those where the level of debt, for example, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1140.1399999999999s)]
*  where the oil import in the country exceeds 80% of GDP, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1144.18s)]
*  where they have very limited resources to deploy for social programs, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1148.0200000000002s)]
*  but also it helps structurally. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1151.74s)]
*  It helps structurally by increasing the competitiveness of the economy, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1153.98s)]
*  as well as also it helps in terms of improving governance by modernizing the state [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1157.5800000000002s)]
*  and modernizing, in fact, the administration, especially as we are at the turning point [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1162.9s)]
*  with technology and its development that is going to reshape the way not only [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1167.9s)]
*  the private economy is functioning, but also the state and the state services are being delivered. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1173.94s)]
*  Therefore, it's a timely paper that, in fact, try to look at the situation broadly. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1180.42s)]
*  What are the issues? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1188.18s)]
*  How these issues are interacting in terms of what are their implications [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1189.6200000000001s)]
*  and how moving forward we can, through reforming the wage bill, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1196.94s)]
*  improve inclusiveness in those countries. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1201.7800000000002s)]
*  As Tao mentioned in his introductory remarks, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1205.98s)]
*  definitely when you look at the region, compared to other similar countries, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1208.74s)]
*  the wage bill is higher. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1216.5s)]
*  And this is particular to MENA countries. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1218.5400000000002s)]
*  And the wage bill is growing fast, which is the case for Central Asian and Caucasus countries. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1222.6200000000001s)]
*  Therefore, we have really an issue here. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1229.78s)]
*  And this issue is, in fact, exacerbated with the recent shocks, as I said, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1232.1399999999999s)]
*  and the way government reacted to it. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1238.6999999999998s)]
*  For some countries, especially oil exporting countries, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1242.1s)]
*  it becomes unsustainable for them to keep this high level of wage bill. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1244.86s)]
*  If we look more specifically to countries, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1250.34s)]
*  we see in terms of the employment in the public sector compared to the rest of the world, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1253.7800000000002s)]
*  most of the countries in the region are, in fact, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1261.3400000000001s)]
*  have a level of public sector employment that is higher than the average of emerging markets. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1265.26s)]
*  And for certain countries, it's two or three times higher than what is in equivalent countries. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1272.3000000000002s)]
*  Therefore, clearly, you have a high level of employment. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1279.62s)]
*  And the question here, how this high level of employment is, in fact, affecting public policy? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1283.78s)]
*  Is it creating better services in what the government is providing? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1290.3799999999999s)]
*  Is it, in fact, improving social conditions? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1295.4199999999998s)]
*  What is the impact of this level of employment in terms of the efficiency and the productivity of government? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1299.8999999999999s)]
*  Therefore, another peculiarity in the region that on average, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1310.54s)]
*  the public wage bill compared to the private sector, salary and wages, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1318.3799999999999s)]
*  show that there is, in fact, bias toward public sector employment. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1323.78s)]
*  And here, most of the countries have higher wage, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1331.02s)]
*  relatively speaking, on average, compared to the private sector. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1335.66s)]
*  And this doesn't include some of the other benefits and the non-monetary benefits [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1341.5400000000002s)]
*  that usually come with public sector employment. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1347.66s)]
*  And if we add these elements into the equation, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1350.94s)]
*  it's clearly showing that there is a bias toward getting employed in the public sector, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1353.78s)]
*  that hence, in fact, is limiting the productivity of the private sector [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1358.78s)]
*  because they need to catch up and increase wages [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1363.54s)]
*  and make the economies of those countries less and less competitive. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1366.7s)]
*  Therefore, as I said, high level of employment, relatively high level of wages. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1372.62s)]
*  Therefore, the question is, is this, in fact, improving the service delivery? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1380.5s)]
*  Clearly, when you look at the various indicators, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1386.7s)]
*  and this is one that shows government effectiveness, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1389.02s)]
*  the level of effectiveness in the service delivered by government in the region [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1391.9399999999998s)]
*  is not at par with the level of investment [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1398.5s)]
*  that is being made in the public sector employment. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1402.3799999999999s)]
*  This is particularly the case for oil-importing countries in MENA. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1405.5s)]
*  Even with countries where the level of salaries are very generous, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1409.82s)]
*  as we saw in the previous slide, for example, in oil-exporting countries, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1412.9399999999998s)]
*  we don't see really differentiator here. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1416.58s)]
*  Therefore, the level of salaries or employment in the public sector [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1420.06s)]
*  is not positively affecting the delivery of services in the public sector. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1424.06s)]
*  The second thing is there is no evidence that could show [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1429.74s)]
*  that this high level of employment in the public sector [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1434.06s)]
*  is improving on the employment side, i.e. reducing the level of unemployment. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1437.98s)]
*  Therefore, when we look at this graph, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1443.34s)]
*  you cannot draw any correlation between employment in the public sector [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1446.3s)]
*  and also the level of unemployment. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1452.06s)]
*  Therefore, clearly, it's not showing that increasing employment [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1454.5800000000002s)]
*  in the public sector or using employment in the public sector [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1460.14s)]
*  as a way to address a structural issue, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1463.14s)]
*  which is the level of unemployment that needs to be addressed [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1465.98s)]
*  more through other types of policy, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1469.46s)]
*  this policy is not, in fact, having the impact that is expected. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1471.42s)]
*  Therefore, given the weight of the wage bill and the budget, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1475.94s)]
*  as I said, especially for oil-importing countries [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1483.94s)]
*  where the level of debt is exceeding 80% on average, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1487.78s)]
*  and given also the level of budget deficit [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1491.7s)]
*  that those countries are facing in the context of rapidly declining oil price [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1495.1000000000001s)]
*  and that oil price is still, in fact, at relatively low level, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1500.5800000000002s)]
*  if you want to address social issues, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1504.54s)]
*  if you want to invest in the productivity of the economy, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1506.74s)]
*  you need to get some resources freed up. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1510.46s)]
*  Otherwise, as we see here in this slide, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1513.5s)]
*  what is being spent on social by government in oil-importing countries [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1517.26s)]
*  is very, very low, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1523.74s)]
*  as well as also what is being invested in infrastructure [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1526.02s)]
*  for a region that has been growing at a low pace [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1529.74s)]
*  and if we look forward, for example, for menop countries, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1533.9s)]
*  we need to create in the next five years 25 million additional jobs [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1539.34s)]
*  to absorb those who are coming into the labour market. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1546.78s)]
*  Therefore, addressing this issue is not only to address the level [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1550.02s)]
*  of weaknesses in social spending, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1556.38s)]
*  as well as also in modernizing the infrastructure, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1559.1s)]
*  but also to think the future, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1562.3400000000001s)]
*  because if we project ourselves five years from now, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1564.66s)]
*  what is being required from government to be spent both on social programs [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1567.7s)]
*  as well as also on modernizing the infrastructure [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1572.3400000000001s)]
*  will be bigger if we want to, in fact, improve economic and social conditions [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1575.02s)]
*  and if we want to achieve the objective that all the societies are claiming [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1580.46s)]
*  and asking for, which is more inclusiveness [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1585.54s)]
*  in the way growth is being shared. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1588.1000000000001s)]
*  Therefore, clearly, freeing up some resources, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1591.6200000000001s)]
*  what we call in our jargon, having a fiscal space, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1595.1000000000001s)]
*  is needed in order to address needs on the social [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1598.94s)]
*  as well as also on the infrastructure front. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1604.3s)]
*  The other thing that we have on the paper, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1610.7s)]
*  and there are, in fact, a few case studies, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1612.3400000000001s)]
*  I would encourage the readers to look at them at the appendix, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1615.38s)]
*  we have a few case studies about what countries did in the region [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1619.46s)]
*  in terms of reforming the wage bill. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1624.2600000000002s)]
*  Quickly, what one could see is we are seeing some attempts [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1627.9s)]
*  to address or to reform the wage bill. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1633.0600000000002s)]
*  And by the way, reforming the wage bill, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1635.94s)]
*  it doesn't mean automatically cutting the wage bill as expenditure, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1637.7800000000002s)]
*  but reforming it as a way to make sure that it is, in fact, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1644.6200000000001s)]
*  relevant to the size of the economy, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1648.78s)]
*  relevant to the quality of service that is being rendered, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1650.8999999999999s)]
*  and also fiscally sustainable. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1653.58s)]
*  Therefore, over the last few years, we saw some attempts. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1655.7399999999998s)]
*  Most of them were around putting some short-term fixes [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1662.1799999999998s)]
*  to structural problem or to long-term problem, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1668.8999999999999s)]
*  mainly by freezing hiring or by introducing some attrition, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1672.6599999999999s)]
*  non-replacement of those who are going on retirement. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1677.22s)]
*  This is good, but this is definitely a short-lived and short-term measure. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1681.42s)]
*  It doesn't address the root cause of the problem, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1685.9s)]
*  and it's something that has proven to be not sustainable [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1688.74s)]
*  if it's only the policy lever that is being used. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1691.94s)]
*  The second attempt is to have to freeze salaries [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1695.5400000000002s)]
*  as a way, in fact, to address the fiscal unsustainable situation. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1700.18s)]
*  This is, as I said, also another short-term measure, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1705.7s)]
*  but it's not enough. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1708.62s)]
*  Some countries have resorted to it. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1710.3s)]
*  What we believe the wage bill reform is [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1713.54s)]
*  is a very good introduction to broad reform of the public sector, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1717.26s)]
*  whereby we link wages to productivity, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1722.54s)]
*  we link wages to performance, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1725.58s)]
*  we use wages as a way to attract the talented people into the public sector. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1727.5s)]
*  We are able to measure the performance of the public services. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1733.74s)]
*  We are able to embrace what is happening now as a technological revolution, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1738.5800000000002s)]
*  whereby in the next five to ten years, most of the public services, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1745.1000000000001s)]
*  as well as also the private services, will be, in fact, rendered differently. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1748.9s)]
*  Technology, digital, will be the main means of providing services, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1753.5800000000002s)]
*  and for those countries to be able to compete, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1758.8200000000002s)]
*  they need also to embrace this technological revolution. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1761.8600000000001s)]
*  And therefore, addressing, in fact, in a structural way, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1766.94s)]
*  the wage bill and reform it and put it part of broader public sector reform, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1772.7s)]
*  or I would say even have it as the first step of the public sector reform, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1778.02s)]
*  this is what we recommend for countries in the Middle East and Central Asia. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1783.06s)]
*  Very quickly, the key question is how, how to do it, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1788.74s)]
*  and why now is going to be different from the past. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1795.7s)]
*  And this is, in fact, what the team tried to do, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1798.82s)]
*  look at past experience, what has been done in the past, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1801.78s)]
*  and the way to do it now, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1805.54s)]
*  learning from past experience and the current challenges. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1807.78s)]
*  And therefore, the first question was, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1811.1s)]
*  what should be the purpose of those reforms? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1814.18s)]
*  And there are, in fact, clearly four, as you see them in the slide, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1816.58s)]
*  is how to make this key expenditure sustainable, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1822.34s)]
*  especially in the context of growing public sector [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1826.78s)]
*  and the context of high wage bill. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1830.54s)]
*  It's therefore how to anchor the growth of the wage bill going forward, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1832.6999999999998s)]
*  especially with aging population, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1836.6599999999999s)]
*  especially with additional needs in order to improve education [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1838.5s)]
*  in the region where education indicators are showing a lot of weaknesses. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1841.8999999999999s)]
*  Therefore, how to anchor the wage bill growth, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1846.8999999999999s)]
*  and the expected outcome is to have a fiscal sustainability here. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1850.58s)]
*  The second purpose is how to make, in fact, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1855.78s)]
*  wage bill or public sector more efficient. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1861.5s)]
*  And in fact, here, the main avenue for reform is, in fact, to review, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1864.7s)]
*  to review sectoral, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1871.26s)]
*  the various sectors that are run by government, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1876.1000000000001s)]
*  and how to reform them. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1879.74s)]
*  And the expected outcome is, in fact, to improve the service delivery [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1881.54s)]
*  and to make the government and the government services beneficial, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1887.6200000000001s)]
*  both to citizens and to private sector, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1892.46s)]
*  and help in improving competitiveness. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1894.74s)]
*  The third one is how to strengthen institution and data, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1897.54s)]
*  because clearly, there are a lot of distortions [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1900.8999999999999s)]
*  in terms of how salary scale is set, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1905.06s)]
*  the level of benefits and additional financial compensations, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1907.8999999999999s)]
*  long-term sustainability, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1915.86s)]
*  how this is going to have an impact on the pension. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1917.98s)]
*  Therefore, there is a lot of work to be done [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1922.18s)]
*  to improve the quality of information, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1925.8999999999999s)]
*  to have detailed information on the wage bill, on the employment, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1928.0600000000002s)]
*  and to be able to strengthen the institution, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1931.7800000000002s)]
*  civil service agencies and boards, etc. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1934.26s)]
*  The fourth one is, in fact, how to put the wage bill reform [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1937.5s)]
*  part of broader reform that will help inclusiveness. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1942.42s)]
*  And how to make this wage bill reform [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1946.6200000000001s)]
*  interact with other public sector reform and other public policies. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1949.74s)]
*  And here, the objective is much broader, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1955.66s)]
*  is, in fact, to use this as a way to make the economy more competitive [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1958.74s)]
*  and the state more conducive toward inclusiveness. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1963.42s)]
*  Few recommendations, what we try to do in this paper, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1971.26s)]
*  not to have it country-specific or not to have a kind of old recipes [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1973.58s)]
*  that will be applied for all, is more guiding principles. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1977.9s)]
*  One is make public wage fiscally sustainable. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1981.22s)]
*  This is easy to say, not easy to implement on the ground, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1984.5s)]
*  especially when we integrate the political economy of reform, [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1989.18s)]
*  how difficult, in fact, to anchor the wage bill in a medium-term framework. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1992.8200000000002s)]
*  Usually, governments are short-term in their approach [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=1997.46s)]
*  because they have short-term issues to address. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2001.42s)]
*  How to reform the civil service and restructure the public sector [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2004.8600000000001s)]
*  in a sustainable medium-term framework. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2009.54s)]
*  The second recommendation is focus policies [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2012.18s)]
*  on effective and efficient delivery of public service [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2015.66s)]
*  and also make the way we deliver public service equitable [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2020.9s)]
*  in terms of providing the same access to people for those services. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2025.06s)]
*  No bias, no differentiation. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2029.3s)]
*  Therefore, improving service delivery mechanisms [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2031.3799999999999s)]
*  and the digital revolution is an important way to achieve on that. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2034.82s)]
*  Countries in the region have high level of mobile utilisation [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2041.46s)]
*  in terms of mobile penetration, etc. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2046.02s)]
*  But the level of the delivery of public services [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2049.02s)]
*  on those new platforms is still very weak. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2053.02s)]
*  This is something that should be part of the equation [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2056.1s)]
*  in terms of reforming the wage bill, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2059.46s)]
*  is also to provide additional improvements in terms of services, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2061.58s)]
*  additional resources to be used for inclusiveness [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2066.18s)]
*  and also improve the way institutions function. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2069.38s)]
*  This is something that starts by having better quality of data [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2073.26s)]
*  on the wage bill, better quality of data on the public service [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2077.7000000000003s)]
*  and goes to the extreme of having strong public sector institutions [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2081.3s)]
*  where citizens have confidence in the way hiring, firing, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2086.38s)]
*  promotion in the public sector is done [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2090.26s)]
*  and have the public sector being, in fact, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2092.38s)]
*  protected from any political interference. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2095.02s)]
*  Last but not the least, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2101.82s)]
*  as one of our key recommendations, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2104.94s)]
*  is not to look at the wage bill reform on a stand-alone basis. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2108.1s)]
*  Put it in a broader context, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2111.82s)]
*  put it as a way, in fact, to allow the economy to diversify, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2113.66s)]
*  to create more space for the private sector, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2118.1s)]
*  to access quality labour [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2120.8999999999996s)]
*  and also redirect some of those fiscal resources [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2124.2599999999998s)]
*  for a better social safety net. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2129.3799999999997s)]
*  We believe that in parallel to this reform, [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2131.7799999999997s)]
*  there will be some implications and therefore need to be addressed, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2135.54s)]
*  plus a better utilisation of public money [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2139.54s)]
*  that will achieve a higher level of equity in the system [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2143.9799999999996s)]
*  and efficiency in use of public money [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2148.94s)]
*  could be reached by putting the wage bill [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2151.38s)]
*  part of broader public sector reform [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2154.86s)]
*  and part of broader economic reform. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2157.3s)]
*  Let me quickly sum up. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2160.94s)]
*  Yes, we believe that reforming the public wage bill [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2162.98s)]
*  is an opportunity today to modernise the economy, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2165.9s)]
*  reform the public sector, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2169.6600000000003s)]
*  allow for better utilisation of public resources [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2171.1800000000003s)]
*  and sustainability in terms of fiscal situation. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2176.06s)]
*  Second, the wage bill reform is not on stand-alone. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2181.98s)]
*  It is part of broader fiscal reforms. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2185.94s)]
*  One of them is to have the tax system being more progressive [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2191.3s)]
*  and more equitable, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2195.7000000000003s)]
*  but also to make sure that, for example, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2197.18s)]
*  the money that is being spent on subsidy is redirected [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2203.22s)]
*  through better targeting to reach those who need it. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2206.2599999999998s)]
*  Therefore, this is a piece of broader fiscal puzzle [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2208.74s)]
*  and this is a piece of broader economic puzzle, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2212.06s)]
*  the way we see it. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2215.2599999999998s)]
*  This is why we believe that using this as first step [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2216.42s)]
*  in modernising public sector [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2222.22s)]
*  will contribute to improve service delivery, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2223.94s)]
*  will also help modernise government [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2227.06s)]
*  and make government, in fact, especially for countries [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2230.66s)]
*  that are ranking very low in terms of doing business [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2233.42s)]
*  and in terms of efficiency of government service delivery, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2236.98s)]
*  to improve on that and to make economies more competitive [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2240.2599999999998s)]
*  and conducive to create jobs. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2243.58s)]
*  Last but not the least, those reforms are country-specific. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2245.7799999999997s)]
*  There is no one-size-fits-all [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2249.38s)]
*  and they have to be designed, taken into consideration, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2251.86s)]
*  various factors, political economy, of reform. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2255.06s)]
*  The fiscal situation, how acute is the need to do it? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2258.1s)]
*  How to benefit from best practices that we have [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2264.3s)]
*  and this is something that we at the Fund, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2269.66s)]
*  we are ready to provide for countries [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2271.86s)]
*  in order to design a reform that is, on one hand, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2275.78s)]
*  country-specific and suitable to their issues, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2279.18s)]
*  but on the other hand, benefits from what has been done in other places. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2281.78s)]
*  And also, this is a long-term transformation [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2286.7s)]
*  and it's not something that we consider as short-term measure [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2289.9s)]
*  and this is why we believe that this is first, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2293.74s)]
*  in fact, the first paper is to lay the ground, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2296.7799999999997s)]
*  show where are the weaknesses, give some recommendations [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2300.9s)]
*  and then progress with countries on the way forward. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2304.42s)]
*  With that, thank you very much [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2309.18s)]
*  and I'm very happy with the discussion [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2310.7799999999997s)]
*  to answer any of your questions. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2313.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2316.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2346.54s)]
*  Get into, as you mentioned, the political economy, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2369.9s)]
*  the messy politics behind this, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2373.06s)]
*  why there hasn't been more done on this issue in these countries, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2375.7400000000002s)]
*  why some of the things that have been tried [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2381.6200000000003s)]
*  haven't worked particularly well and so forth. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2383.6200000000003s)]
*  So, Teresa, I'd like to invite you to comment on the report first. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2386.6200000000003s)]
*  First of all, any overall comments you have, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2392.86s)]
*  I would welcome, as well as your experience [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2395.58s)]
*  with the political economy aspect [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2398.6600000000003s)]
*  and the politics that goes behind the decision-making [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2401.94s)]
*  regarding public sector and public sector wage bills and so forth. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2408.94s)]
*  So, please, the floor is yours. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2413.9s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2415.34s)]
*  First of all, let me thank very much the Carnegie Center [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2416.5s)]
*  and my friends in the Middle East and Central Asian Department of the Fund [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2419.7000000000003s)]
*  for inviting me to comment on this interesting and really very topical paper. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2424.34s)]
*  I mean, Giada emphasized in his presentation, I entirely agree, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2429.9s)]
*  the region faces severe development and fiscal challenges [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2433.5s)]
*  that not only justify but really require a close look at public wages [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2437.5s)]
*  because these represent, on average, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2443.78s)]
*  a substantial portion of current public expenditure in the region [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2446.78s)]
*  and because they are above the levels prevailing in comparator countries. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2450.82s)]
*  I would like to say upfront that I really liked the paper. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2455.74s)]
*  I thought it was highly relevant but also well-researched [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2459.9s)]
*  and that it offered a series of thoughtful policy reform options [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2464.9s)]
*  for the considerations of the region's authorities. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2471.22s)]
*  I particularly wish to commend the authors' efforts [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2475.66s)]
*  to collect such a wealth of information. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2481.7s)]
*  I can guarantee you it was not an easy task, I'm sure, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2485.2599999999998s)]
*  because I know what it goes into collecting all this data from countries [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2488.7799999999997s)]
*  that still have a lot of lacuna in this respect. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2493.74s)]
*  And also to put the region's situation and trends in an international perspective. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2499.9s)]
*  So, my focus and my comments focus really on areas for further research [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2505.46s)]
*  and reflection. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2511.8199999999997s)]
*  First of all, I would have liked to see in the paper [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2514.2599999999998s)]
*  more analysis of the political economy of public wage reforms in the region. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2517.58s)]
*  This is especially important because the evidence assembled in the paper [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2523.02s)]
*  shows that reform efforts have been generally short-lived. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2527.18s)]
*  This raises the question whether the obstacles are greater for short-term [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2532.66s)]
*  or longer-term structural reforms. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2540.86s)]
*  My impression from reading the paper is that the governments in the region [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2543.2599999999998s)]
*  have been more able to enact shorter measures, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2547.7799999999997s)]
*  such as hiring or wage freezes, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2552.22s)]
*  than to sustain less drastic structural reforms over the longer term. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2554.7799999999997s)]
*  I was wondering whether this has been the case [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2562.06s)]
*  because short-term measures were introduced [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2564.66s)]
*  under condition of external or fiscal stress [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2567.5s)]
*  and therefore were reversed subsequently when the stress is. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2571.2599999999998s)]
*  Since the paper correctly emphasises the costs of this stop-go type of measure, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2577.46s)]
*  social costs, efficiency costs, distributional costs, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2585.42s)]
*  I'm wondering whether perhaps there shouldn't be more reflection [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2589.9s)]
*  of the trade-offs between short-term, [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2594.66s)]
*  whether there are trade-offs between short-term and longer-term measures [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2597.82s)]
*  and how these trade-offs should be taken into account [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2601.98s)]
*  in the design of programmes, including fund-supported programmes. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2605.42s)]
*  The paper calls for a social impact analysis [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2610.78s)]
*  of the proposed public wages reform. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2614.02s)]
*  I entirely agree with this. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2617.1400000000003s)]
*  I think this is very important to do, [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2618.82s)]
*  but it should focus not only on the lower-income groups [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2621.6200000000003s)]
*  but also on the middle class [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2625.5s)]
*  because it is the middle class that is more likely to be affected [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2626.98s)]
*  or be the loser of these reforms in the short run. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2631.78s)]
*  The middle class has more political clout [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2637.66s)]
*  than generally the poorer groups. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2642.34s)]
*  So a careful identification of the likely losers from the reforms [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2645.82s)]
*  is crucial for designing appropriate, well-targeted [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2650.9s)]
*  and ultimately fiscally affordable compensatory measures. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2654.46s)]
*  More generally, the identification of the likely social costs [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2659.62s)]
*  of the reform is important for the overall design of the reform strategy [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2664.2200000000003s)]
*  and for its sequencing with the complementary forms. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2669.38s)]
*  For example, trying to offset measures with high upfront costs [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2672.94s)]
*  such as restructuring of services [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2677.42s)]
*  that entail significant losses of public jobs [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2679.98s)]
*  with ones that have longer-term pay-offs [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2683.8999999999996s)]
*  such as increased spending on education [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2686.2999999999997s)]
*  or measures to improve the business climate [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2688.9399999999996s)]
*  may give rise to strong social opposition. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2691.74s)]
*  In these cases, for instance, it would be more useful [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2695.5s)]
*  to increase or extend the duration of unemployment compensation schemes. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2698.5s)]
*  In some cases, there may not even be an unemployment compensation scheme [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2702.7s)]
*  and this would have to be created [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2706.7799999999997s)]
*  than putting a lot of emphasis on longer-term reforms. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2709.42s)]
*  This may sound a little bit sort of heterodox to say [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2715.02s)]
*  but I think these are the political realities [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2722.22s)]
*  and ultimately they are essential for the success of the reforms. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2725.9s)]
*  In designing reform strategies, it's also important [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2731.9s)]
*  to fully internalise institutional and legal constraints. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2734.98s)]
*  And to recognise the heterogeneity of the civil servants. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2738.54s)]
*  For instance, increasing geographic mobility of the civil servants [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2742.7799999999997s)]
*  which is in many countries an important component [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2747.66s)]
*  or should be an important component of reforms [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2750.82s)]
*  may be made more difficult by rigidities in the housing market. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2753.18s)]
*  This obstacle might be addressed [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2757.74s)]
*  through appropriately generous relocation bonuses. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2759.9s)]
*  Also, one should consider that while some skills may be transferable [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2764.7799999999997s)]
*  across different sectors of the civil service, others may not. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2770.22s)]
*  For example, those of health workers or of engineers. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2774.7799999999997s)]
*  You cannot just shift people that are health workers [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2778.2599999999998s)]
*  to be teachers or people who are engineers to do health work, for example. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2782.94s)]
*  Training or retraining programmes can work only partially [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2790.2599999999998s)]
*  to address such constraints. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2793.42s)]
*  And finally, it should be recognised that reforming pay scales [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2796.1000000000004s)]
*  and linking wages and career progressions to performance [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2799.82s)]
*  is not an easy task, as has been amply evidenced by the literature [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2803.1800000000003s)]
*  and by international experiences in this area. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2808.26s)]
*  The paper shows clearly that wage bill spending [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2812.54s)]
*  tends to be pro-cyclical during economic upswings [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2816.7400000000002s)]
*  but it shows some downward rigidity during downswings [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2820.2599999999998s)]
*  at least until the financing constraints become binding. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2824.02s)]
*  This argues for adopting a rule [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2828.2599999999998s)]
*  that limits the rate of real growth of public wage spending. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2831.4599999999996s)]
*  However, I would stress that such a rule [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2837.2599999999998s)]
*  would need to cover all the aspects of the civil servants' compensation [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2839.9399999999996s)]
*  and it should be accompanied by clear accounting regulations [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2844.9399999999996s)]
*  to avoid misclassifications of such compensation. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2848.7s)]
*  Also, a rule limiting the real wage, public wage growth [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2852.82s)]
*  may have the disadvantage of de facto setting a floor [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2858.3s)]
*  on the growth of the public wage bill [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2863.06s)]
*  and of encouraging outsources not justified by efficiency consideration. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2865.58s)]
*  To be effective over the longer term, [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2871.5s)]
*  the rule should also be supported by any necessary changes [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2873.98s)]
*  in the relevant legislation, for instance regarding the tenure of civil servants. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2879.1400000000003s)]
*  There is no point in setting a rule [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2884.38s)]
*  when you don't have institutional underpinnings [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2886.7400000000002s)]
*  to implement it effectively. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2890.46s)]
*  Finally, the paper recognises that there are significant wage data limitations [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2893.6200000000003s)]
*  ampering cross-country comparisons [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2899.42s)]
*  and also limiting the depth of analysis of the structure of the public wage bill [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2901.86s)]
*  and the drivers of the development of the wage bill over time. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2906.98s)]
*  I find particularly of concern [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2911.54s)]
*  the lack of reliable information on public employment and wages [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2914.42s)]
*  in local governments and extra-budgetary institutions. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2918.5s)]
*  This is likely to become even greater concern [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2923.0600000000004s)]
*  because the trend which is well established worldwide [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2926.66s)]
*  of moving services to the sub-national levels of government [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2931.2599999999998s)]
*  is beginning to spread throughout the region. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2936.66s)]
*  Remedying this shortcoming will require, in most instances, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2942.38s)]
*  both strengthening public accounting regulations [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2946.54s)]
*  to ensure homogeneity of practices across levels of government [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2949.74s)]
*  and also assistance by the central government [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2955.2599999999998s)]
*  to the smaller local governments [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2958.74s)]
*  to strengthen their capacity to comply with the accounting regulations [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2960.86s)]
*  so as to generate statistics that are reliable [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2965.62s)]
*  and sufficiently detailed. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2969.7799999999997s)]
*  Thank you, Teresa. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2973.42s)]
*  Jehad, I see you taking notes. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2974.7799999999997s)]
*  I think after Amy has spoken, I'll give you a couple of minutes to respond [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2976.46s)]
*  because I think Teresa did raise a lot of important points. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2981.42s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2984.2999999999997s)]
*  Amy, one of the features of this report [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2985.4599999999996s)]
*  is a box summarizing input from civil society organisations [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2989.58s)]
*  and labour unions about public sector wage reform, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2994.54s)]
*  which is often the subject of a lot of concern [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=2998.2599999999998s)]
*  due to the impact on social welfare and so forth. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3001.74s)]
*  We're counting on you to bring this perspective to the table [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3006.06s)]
*  and maybe also to dive in. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3011.5s)]
*  I know you'd like to look at a couple of the countries [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3013.94s)]
*  in the report a little bit more specifically. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3017.1s)]
*  Please, I welcome your remarks. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3020.06s)]
*  Thanks a lot for inviting me. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3021.74s)]
*  Thanks for my friends at Carnegie. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3023.7s)]
*  I am actually invited to sit on this panel. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3025.54s)]
*  First, I like the report. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3028.8199999999997s)]
*  Yes, it's overdue reform in the public sector. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3031.8599999999997s)]
*  As an Egyptian citizen myself, growing up in Egypt, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3035.1s)]
*  it's a nightmare when someone asks me to go to a public office [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3038.22s)]
*  to do any type of paper. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3042.74s)]
*  It's something that we always make jokes at when we are in Egypt. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3044.38s)]
*  So, yes, it's overdue. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3049.2999999999997s)]
*  But I also welcome that the report stressed on [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3052.58s)]
*  it's not one size fits all and it's different from one country to another. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3057.62s)]
*  And when I want to talk about the civil society recommendations, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3062.2599999999998s)]
*  I want to dig more into the specifics of each country. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3068.3799999999997s)]
*  And of course, as you can expect, I will use Egypt as an example [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3072.2599999999998s)]
*  because this is the country I came from and I still visit a lot of times. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3076.3799999999997s)]
*  So, in Egypt, the report itself mentioned that the public wage, [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3081.8199999999997s)]
*  the load of the public wage on the GDP is exceptionally lower [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3089.22s)]
*  than other countries in the region. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3094.38s)]
*  In the fiscal year 2015-2016, it was 7.9%. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3096.38s)]
*  And even though it's lower than other countries, [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3103.78s)]
*  still the government promised to freeze the wages [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3107.42s)]
*  and to cut it to a bit more, to six something. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3111.06s)]
*  The other thing, like the payments, the wages in the public sector, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3116.2200000000003s)]
*  unlike the other countries in the region, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3120.0600000000004s)]
*  is much, much less than the wages in the private sector. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3122.34s)]
*  And this is part of the problem of the public sector in Egypt [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3126.34s)]
*  because employees in the public sector, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3130.1000000000004s)]
*  they have to do some bribery, corruption, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3133.42s)]
*  or even sign in the morning in the office and go and drive a taxi [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3138.26s)]
*  to make ends meet. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3144.2599999999998s)]
*  But it's like, so this is part of the problem, that the wages are really low. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3147.66s)]
*  And just to give an example from the education sector, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3153.1s)]
*  the wages for the teachers is really low. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3156.5s)]
*  So teachers there encourage the students to take private lessons [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3159.8599999999997s)]
*  in order to succeed and to go to next level in school. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3164.2599999999998s)]
*  And this has become like a black market [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3169.46s)]
*  and it's a lot of resources that are untaxed for the government. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3172.1s)]
*  So it's revenue that is not tapped from the government [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3176.22s)]
*  because of the very low wages for teachers. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3180.34s)]
*  And also this affects the education, the quality of education, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3184.1s)]
*  which also affects the jobs in the private sector [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3188.54s)]
*  because people are not equipped with the needed skills [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3193.02s)]
*  to qualify them for the private sector jobs. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3196.42s)]
*  So part of the problem there is the very low wages, not the high wages. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3199.7s)]
*  There are many other problems. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3205.62s)]
*  It's not only fiscal, there are corruption. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3207.46s)]
*  There is a lot of secrecy. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3210.42s)]
*  There is the off-budget funds [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3213.7s)]
*  that like a lot of allowances and salaries for senior officials [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3216.8199999999997s)]
*  and it's not accounted for. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3221.38s)]
*  So we don't know about how much those public funds, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3223.14s)]
*  those are off-budget funds, pay for senior officials. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3227.46s)]
*  Also the sectoral, it's like you will see [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3233.54s)]
*  security sector, the police, the military, [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3237.38s)]
*  all of those wages are really high [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3241.7000000000003s)]
*  compared to the education and the health sector, [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3244.82s)]
*  which are very needed services there, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3247.38s)]
*  especially if we want to meet the SDGs' goals. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3250.02s)]
*  The other thing that I want to look at [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3254.82s)]
*  is all the other economic reforms [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3258.5s)]
*  that were introduced at the same time [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3261.74s)]
*  with the public sector reform in Egypt [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3264.66s)]
*  and look at the how to free resources [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3267.14s)]
*  that the report claim if we free resources from the public wage, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3271.62s)]
*  this would go into investment and social protection. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3277.02s)]
*  So first, in two years, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3280.14s)]
*  the local currency was floated. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3282.8599999999997s)]
*  So from nine Egyptian pounds for one dollar, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3285.7799999999997s)]
*  it went through in two months up to 20 Egyptian pounds for one dollar [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3295.9399999999996s)]
*  and now it went back to 17, [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3301.8199999999997s)]
*  even though the IMF expected it to go back to 14, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3304.66s)]
*  but I don't think it will ever reach the 14. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3310.62s)]
*  It's now has been in the range of 17 and 18 for a long time. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3313.62s)]
*  So inflation is really high, it reached 32.2% as of March 2017. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3318.22s)]
*  The VAT, the value added tax was introduced, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3325.94s)]
*  electricity tariff was increased, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3330.86s)]
*  the subsidy, gas subsidy was lifted [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3333.22s)]
*  and of course this all affected the purchasing power for Egyptians [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3336.18s)]
*  and of course this affected also the market, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3342.42s)]
*  so less production because we don't have enough buyers there. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3344.86s)]
*  So it all existed and now we are also freezing the wages [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3350.54s)]
*  in the public sector that were already low. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3354.58s)]
*  So this is the cumulative impact of all the reforms, [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3357.18s)]
*  so we cannot look at the public sector in isolation [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3361.74s)]
*  from the other economic policies that were introduced at the same time. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3364.82s)]
*  So this is one thing in Egypt. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3372.42s)]
*  And speaking of how to free resources for the social protection [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3374.98s)]
*  or programs or for investment [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3379.6200000000003s)]
*  and look tapping into the public wage to free those resources, [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3382.7000000000003s)]
*  let's talk about other untapped resources. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3387.26s)]
*  With the floating of the currency [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3391.98s)]
*  and one of the advice of the IMF was to increase the interest rate. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3394.7s)]
*  So this also to make sure that they can control the inflation. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3401.62s)]
*  So what happened is because the government had accumulated [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3407.78s)]
*  a lot of domestic debts, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3412.98s)]
*  so this increased the domestic debts for the government [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3414.78s)]
*  and now the government pays 34% of its expenditure towards domestic debts. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3417.62s)]
*  So this was money that could have freed for social protection and investment. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3424.1s)]
*  But also add to this, now the wealthy people can buy bonds [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3430.86s)]
*  that would give them 20% interest so they accumulate more wealth. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3437.02s)]
*  So actually this policy worked for the wealthy [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3441.7s)]
*  and it's in a way indirectly the government is subsidizing [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3445.7s)]
*  the accumulation of wealth for the already rich people [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3450.02s)]
*  and taking away from money that could have been spent [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3453.22s)]
*  on social protection and investment. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3456.66s)]
*  And so this is all things that need to be considered in relation to each other. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3459.06s)]
*  The other example that I want to talk about is Tunisia [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3464.34s)]
*  because it has a special place [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3469.7799999999997s)]
*  and I guess in the heart of any citizen in this region. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3472.3399999999997s)]
*  As perceived by many, it's the only hope left in the region [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3475.8999999999996s)]
*  and it needs all the support for this still fragile democratic model to succeed. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3482.06s)]
*  Yes, the public wage there is really high, [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3489.2999999999997s)]
*  but there are many reasons of this [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3493.3799999999997s)]
*  and one of them is the security needs after all the terrorist attacks [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3495.62s)]
*  and it's also because the revenues itself of the government [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3501.54s)]
*  went down after the terrorist attack and losing the resources from tourism [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3506.34s)]
*  and that's why the percentage of wages went higher. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3511.2200000000003s)]
*  So there are many reasons that should be taken into consideration, [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3514.42s)]
*  but even if we say yes, it's high, it needs to be curbed, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3517.58s)]
*  I guess it's more important to protect the democratic process there [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3522.38s)]
*  and taking into consideration the voices of civil society, [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3528.22s)]
*  of the labor unions, the unions for the employers [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3532.1s)]
*  and the fact that the public wage there took a long time to pass, [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3536.5s)]
*  unlike in Egypt, it's really a very good sign [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3541.7s)]
*  because it shows that they have to come together at the table [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3544.82s)]
*  to reach some sort of solution and make negotiation [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3549.18s)]
*  and compromise from each party. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3554.02s)]
*  So it's a very good sign that should be encouraged and not criticized [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3556.38s)]
*  and flexibility should be made here [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3560.42s)]
*  because this is a country that needs... [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3564.02s)]
*  It will be a good example in the region that is full of authoritarian regimes. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3566.78s)]
*  So we all need this country to succeed [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3570.58s)]
*  and play this role model for the rest of the countries. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3574.02s)]
*  So this is more important than the fiscal problem here, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3577.1800000000003s)]
*  the social stability and all the support needed [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3581.66s)]
*  for the democratic process to succeed there. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3585.3s)]
*  Thank you, Amy. I think you've done a great job of putting this issue [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3587.94s)]
*  of public sector wages and wage bills [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3592.7s)]
*  into the context of other economic reforms as in Egypt [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3596.7s)]
*  and what the total effect is [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3600.14s)]
*  as well as in the political context in Tunisia. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3602.46s)]
*  Jehad, I want to give you a few minutes to respond. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3605.94s)]
*  I think that Theresa and Amy have put a lot out on the table here. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3608.8199999999997s)]
*  And meanwhile, audience, prepare your questions [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3612.8199999999997s)]
*  because it's your turn next. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3615.42s)]
*  So, Jehad, please, just take a couple of minutes, if you would, to respond. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3617.22s)]
*  I don't expect you to respond to every point, but the big ones, please. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3621.74s)]
*  And in fact, responding is more engaging in the discussion. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3625.7799999999997s)]
*  I... [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3630.8599999999997s)]
*  I concur with what Theresa said, [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3632.86s)]
*  that this is a complex exercise [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3638.02s)]
*  that requires a certain number of technical [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3641.1800000000003s)]
*  as well as institutional reform for it to produce the right result, [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3645.02s)]
*  i.e., if you don't build the right institutions [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3648.6600000000003s)]
*  that deal with human resource management in the public sector [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3651.42s)]
*  that creates the right mechanism for this reform to produce results. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3654.98s)]
*  In fact, we will be in a situation [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3660.5s)]
*  where we will address part of the problem and not all of it. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3664.3s)]
*  I totally concur with also the issue that political economy [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3670.1000000000004s)]
*  is an important dimension to take into consideration. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3674.3s)]
*  And this is why we are refraining from saying this is the solution. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3678.42s)]
*  We are giving, in fact... [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3683.1800000000003s)]
*  We are saying few important things. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3686.58s)]
*  One is this is the right time to address a problem [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3688.7s)]
*  that has been here for decades. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3692.1s)]
*  And by addressing it, we will help achieve what Amy was looking at, [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3695.3799999999997s)]
*  is how to make, in fact, the economy have a better distribution system, [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3701.54s)]
*  has a better protection system. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3708.42s)]
*  If you don't address this as well as also other items, [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3711.2599999999998s)]
*  it's been a problem for the economy. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3715.3799999999997s)]
*  If you don't address these as well as other items, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3717.94s)]
*  it's very difficult to be able to reach that. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3720.7400000000002s)]
*  Therefore, the political economy is going to be an important element. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3723.1800000000003s)]
*  But I think what we wanted to show that what has been set as objectives [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3726.9s)]
*  for this policy proved not to be as effective as it was. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3731.82s)]
*  And therefore, it's about time to look at it again. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3738.54s)]
*  And it's about time to look at it again [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3741.54s)]
*  that globally the technology is going not only to change [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3743.94s)]
*  the way private sector work, but also public sector work. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3750.1s)]
*  And in five years from now, we will be forced to do a certain number of things [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3753.46s)]
*  in terms of public service delivery, [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3757.94s)]
*  that if we don't address issues now, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3760.1s)]
*  we will be faced with more difficult and challenging situations. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3765.94s)]
*  And I also concur with the point, it's not short-term, one-off. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3770.62s)]
*  It's a process, and this process takes time. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3776.9s)]
*  With Amy, I don't want to focus on these two countries [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3781.86s)]
*  and then the programs with these two countries, [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3787.1s)]
*  but let me have three comments. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3789.34s)]
*  I think we need to differentiate between the service [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3792.98s)]
*  and the quality of the service to the community [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3798.02s)]
*  and the cost of the service to the community. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3805.9s)]
*  You mentioned, you took the example of education. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3808.26s)]
*  It's clear that people are moving from public education to private education [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3811.06s)]
*  not because their wealth has increased, [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3815.42s)]
*  but because of the quality of education in the public sector has deteriorated [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3817.82s)]
*  at a time where employment in the public sector has grown up, has grown. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3822.02s)]
*  Therefore, it's clear that we need also to look at those who [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3826.74s)]
*  are not, in fact, getting, especially the taxpayers, [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3833.7799999999997s)]
*  are not getting what they should expect in terms of return on those services. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3838.1s)]
*  And in the case of Egypt, Egypt has, in terms of employment in the public sector, [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3844.3799999999997s)]
*  a higher level of employment with comparable countries, [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3851.74s)]
*  yet maybe the salaries are not reflecting it, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3857.42s)]
*  but maybe also the statistics are not showing all the expenses. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3860.54s)]
*  Last on Egypt is, yes, the adjustment over the last 12 months [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3865.8199999999997s)]
*  required a certain number of fiscal and monetary measures, [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3871.74s)]
*  but clearly we saw that it allowed the government [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3875.58s)]
*  to redirect some of the funds to address the low-income people issue, [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3879.42s)]
*  and then 30% of the people today are benefiting from those social programs, [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3883.98s)]
*  Takaful and Karama, etc. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3888.98s)]
*  And I concur that maybe in the next generation of those programs [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3891.7400000000002s)]
*  we need to see where the middle class is in it. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3896.54s)]
*  And maybe by using different types of instruments, [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3900.82s)]
*  cash transfer works for low-income people, [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3904.9s)]
*  middle-income is mainly about improving access to quality of services, [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3907.62s)]
*  because this is what matters for them at the end of the day in terms of income, [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3912.66s)]
*  and also show them that there is, in fact, accountability by the state. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3918.26s)]
*  Therefore, I think collectively we need to think about [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3923.1s)]
*  how to cater for the middle-income. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3927.7400000000002s)]
*  As for Tunisia, in fact, in December 2010, [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3930.26s)]
*  it was about a university graduate. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3935.8599999999997s)]
*  He was not able to find a job in the private sector. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3939.3799999999997s)]
*  Therefore, and the whole reform was to modernize the economy, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3944.66s)]
*  to grow faster, to provide for highly educated people [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3951.22s)]
*  a way to get a job that the public sector was not able to provide at the time, [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3955.3399999999997s)]
*  because the public sector was large. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3960.66s)]
*  And what happened in between, [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3962.66s)]
*  the size of the public sector went even bigger. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3964.86s)]
*  Therefore, for those who are currently graduating from universities, [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3968.22s)]
*  entrepreneurs, people who want to do their own, in fact, business, [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3972.14s)]
*  or they want to find a job in a private company, [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3979.38s)]
*  they don't have the ability, [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3984.38s)]
*  because the state has exhausted the resources to pay for the wage bill. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3985.74s)]
*  Therefore, I don't see all the time a positive correlation, [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3990.22s)]
*  even in terms of political adjustment, [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3994.2999999999997s)]
*  between using the tool of increasing employment in the public sector. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=3998.14s)]
*  And also, with the right level of communication and the right measures [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4002.98s)]
*  to accompany a reform like this, [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4009.62s)]
*  you can achieve the objective of improving living conditions, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4012.06s)]
*  providing low-income people access to better services [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4016.46s)]
*  and better opportunities for work, especially for youth. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4020.26s)]
*  20 to 30% of the youth of those countries are unemployed, [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4023.94s)]
*  and the public sector cannot provide them, [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4029.3s)]
*  given the level of employment in the public sector. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4031.78s)]
*  Therefore, maybe the intention is good, [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4034.54s)]
*  but the instruments clearly are showing that they're not efficient. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4037.06s)]
*  And I think, in the case of Tunisia, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4042.02s)]
*  this is what the government is being pursuing now, [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4044.54s)]
*  that redirecting some of the resources [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4047.98s)]
*  will allow them to focus more on what is needed in terms of economic policy [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4053.02s)]
*  to allow the economy to grow faster and to provide jobs for the youth. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4058.9s)]
*  Okay, thank you, Jihad. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4063.54s)]
*  Okay, we'll take questions now. Here's the first one. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4065.26s)]
*  Please give your name and your organizational affiliation, [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4068.62s)]
*  if you have one, and then let me know if your question is for a specific panelist. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4072.1s)]
*  My name is Jo Marie Grease-Grabber. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4076.86s)]
*  I'm with New Rules for Global Finance. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4079.2200000000003s)]
*  And my question, I presume, is to Jihad, [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4081.46s)]
*  I realize that every report can't be comprehensive, [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4085.62s)]
*  can't be encyclopedic, [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4090.82s)]
*  but this focus on the public wage sector [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4092.46s)]
*  really requires questions about sources of revenue for the government [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4098.5s)]
*  and tax policies that are progressive [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4105.38s)]
*  that take the wealth from the super-rich, from the corrupt, [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4107.9800000000005s)]
*  to those in need. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4112.02s)]
*  And I'm wondering how you're going to counterbalance [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4113.46s)]
*  the wage policies with that issue. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4117.3s)]
*  Okay, let's go ahead and respond to that. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4122.82s)]
*  No, very quickly. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4124.74s)]
*  The Fund has done a lot of work, and the department that I'm in [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4126.42s)]
*  has done a lot of work on this issue of fairness in taxation [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4130.38s)]
*  and how to make the tax system, A, more equitable, [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4135.18s)]
*  and B, through progressivity, better sharing of the burden. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4138.820000000001s)]
*  Last but not the least, in the system, in many of those countries, [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4146.46s)]
*  when we look at it, you see that the level of revenues [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4150.780000000001s)]
*  from non-natural resources is low compared to other countries. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4154.42s)]
*  And specifically, you have, through a lot of, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4160.18s)]
*  and here I'm talking in the presence of an expert on fiscal issues, [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4163.06s)]
*  you have a lot of special schemes and exemptions [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4168.54s)]
*  that will introduce an additional layer of inequity in the system. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4172.660000000001s)]
*  And in addition to the progressivity, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4177.900000000001s)]
*  all these special schemes need to be addressed [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4180.1s)]
*  in order to improve efficiency as well as also equity in the system. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4182.46s)]
*  Yes, and last on that, we are working now more on issues [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4190.02s)]
*  related to governance, corruption, [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4194.9s)]
*  and a way to address capture of public resources [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4196.9400000000005s)]
*  and the way to reform that. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4202.86s)]
*  Amy, would either of you like to comment on the tax... [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4206.86s)]
*  No, I mean, other than to say that the fund has really worked a lot [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4209.26s)]
*  on how to improve both tax policy in terms of making it more progressive [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4214.1s)]
*  and more equitable and fair, both horizontally and vertically, [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4220.820000000001s)]
*  but also on tax administration, because let's face it, a lot, [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4225.22s)]
*  I mean, you can have the best designed tax system in theory, [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4230.860000000001s)]
*  and then if there is a lot of evasion or tax avoidance or tax planning, [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4237.3s)]
*  a scope for tax planning, the laws are not relevant. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4242.780000000001s)]
*  I mean, and ultimately the system becomes regressive de facto. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4248.06s)]
*  So I think that a lot of the work of the department [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4251.9400000000005s)]
*  that used to head in the fund, [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4259.58s)]
*  and which works very closely with the Middle East [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4262.5s)]
*  and Central Asia Department in the technical assistant, [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4265.0599999999995s)]
*  is really devoted to improving not only tax policy [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4268.419999999999s)]
*  but also tax administration in the region. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4272.58s)]
*  And this is an issue in oil importing states [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4275.419999999999s)]
*  as well as oil exporting, right? [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4278.5s)]
*  It's not only those governments that have big oil revenues [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4280.099999999999s)]
*  that have been undertaxing or unfairly taxing the population, right? [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4284.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4290.98s)]
*  Okay. So, Amy, please. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4292.139999999999s)]
*  So it's what I noticed when I looked at all the economic policies [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4294.34s)]
*  that were introduced in different countries. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4298.42s)]
*  Ironically, the policies that have negative social impacts [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4300.78s)]
*  or economic impacts on the lower income people [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4307.3s)]
*  or the lower middle income people [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4311.9800000000005s)]
*  are the ones that are introduced, the first ones, [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4314.18s)]
*  and not the ones that will bring revenues from rich people [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4318.06s)]
*  or will affect their style of life. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4323.5s)]
*  So, for example, with this wage problem [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4325.82s)]
*  and the quality of services, [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4329.9400000000005s)]
*  even though we say that it's still with a high employment rate [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4332.66s)]
*  in public sectors, this didn't solve the unemployment, [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4337.82s)]
*  so one would think, okay, so this doesn't work, the unemployment, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4341.9400000000005s)]
*  I wouldn't increase it by freezing hiring, sorry, okay, [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4345.62s)]
*  I wouldn't increase it by freezing hiring in the public sector [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4349.3s)]
*  until I provide more jobs in the private sector [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4352.099999999999s)]
*  to absorb the unemployment. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4355.98s)]
*  But the first thing was to go and curb the salaries [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4358.099999999999s)]
*  from the public sector before introducing the investment law [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4363.379999999999s)]
*  that would facilitate the initiation of new businesses and new jobs, [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4367.379999999999s)]
*  and this is what happened in Egypt, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4371.58s)]
*  like the investment law that was also recommended at the same time [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4373.139999999999s)]
*  by the IMF was just passed two months ago, [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4376.78s)]
*  but the public wage, because it's always easier to go [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4381.38s)]
*  on the poor people and middle income, [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4386.02s)]
*  but not, and it's the same with the taxation. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4388.26s)]
*  Yeah, and this is a major theme of the report, [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4391.54s)]
*  it keeps coming up that there's been this quick fix [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4393.9400000000005s)]
*  of hiring and wage freezes that's been implemented many places, [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4396.9800000000005s)]
*  you noted, Theresa, that that's been resorted to far more often [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4401.7s)]
*  than some of the bigger, more structural things. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4405.54s)]
*  Is that because it's easier to take these measures against people [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4409.18s)]
*  who are much less likely to push back, people, poorer people, [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4414.02s)]
*  or just because it's something quick and easy the government can do? [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4419.02s)]
*  Theresa, you also raised the thing that this is the thing [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4423.780000000001s)]
*  maybe that governments have been asked to do by external institutions. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4426.540000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think I should speak for, [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4431.860000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think GIA is a much better position [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4434.900000000001s)]
*  to answer this specifically in the region, [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4437.82s)]
*  but I think that there are trade-offs [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4439.98s)]
*  between short-term and long-term measures, [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4444.22s)]
*  and where the IMF is always confronted [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4447.66s)]
*  with the need to make a judgement [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4453.0199999999995s)]
*  of where the balance should lie in a particular case. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4456.22s)]
*  Clearly, if a country is exhausted its financing access and so on, [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4459.9s)]
*  it has to privilege measures which may be short-lived [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4466.06s)]
*  but are necessary to make the budget, [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4470.22s)]
*  I mean, to pay the bills basically of the budget in the short run. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4476.02s)]
*  Where there is some more leeway for the authorities [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4481.38s)]
*  in terms of possibility of, as I said, [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4488.14s)]
*  trading off short-term measures for longer term, [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4493.26s)]
*  sometimes the political economy argues more [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4497.22s)]
*  for going for the short-term measures [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4501.860000000001s)]
*  because perhaps they affect less vocal parts of the population. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4506.9800000000005s)]
*  But I don't think that's the case with wage bills [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4512.34s)]
*  because public wage bills basically affect a very vocal part [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4514.7s)]
*  and a very powerful part of the population, [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4521.46s)]
*  I mean, with considerable political clout. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4527.14s)]
*  So I don't think that is necessarily... [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4530.38s)]
*  The political economy necessarily argues [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4533.860000000001s)]
*  for putting all the burden on the public wages. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4538.54s)]
*  It's just that a lot of the measures have been taken [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4545.54s)]
*  when the country was really under very strong external or fiscal constraints. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4549.3s)]
*  Anything, Gerard? [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4556.62s)]
*  Well, I think two comments. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4558.58s)]
*  One is we need to look at things and put them in perspective. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4563.06s)]
*  Taking, for example, the case of Egypt as an example. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4569.26s)]
*  When you intervene in this case, [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4573.900000000001s)]
*  the first phase is to stabilise and the economy address [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4576.86s)]
*  some short-term economic issues [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4581.099999999999s)]
*  that require some short-term measures or some measures to stabilise the situation. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4584.179999999999s)]
*  Phase two is you look into more structural things [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4588.94s)]
*  in order to allow the economy to address its structural weaknesses [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4593.0599999999995s)]
*  or to be able to grow faster and create more growth [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4596.94s)]
*  and address some of the inclusiveness issues. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4602.26s)]
*  Therefore, if I take the medical metaphor, [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4606.139999999999s)]
*  each patient has a different situation [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4610.54s)]
*  and therefore you have to administer a different mix of medicine. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4613.62s)]
*  But it doesn't mean that the medicine that you administer to stabilise should stay. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4619.179999999999s)]
*  The difficulty we face in several countries, [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4623.299999999999s)]
*  and I would say in most of the countries in the region, [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4625.94s)]
*  is as soon as you reach stabilisation, [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4628.66s)]
*  the drive and the appetite for reform, [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4631.54s)]
*  especially both in government as well as also in society, [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4634.0599999999995s)]
*  gets colder. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4640.419999999999s)]
*  Therefore, we are able to achieve stabilisation [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4644.62s)]
*  that in some cases has side effects. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4648.78s)]
*  But for people to see the benefits, [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4651.94s)]
*  the ultimate benefits of the overall transformation, [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4654.98s)]
*  sometimes it's difficult because, as I said, [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4658.379999999999s)]
*  it becomes more difficult to convince decision-makers [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4662.62s)]
*  to look at the long-term issues. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4666.46s)]
*  And this is why in the case of the wage bill [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4668.46s)]
*  we see government have easier way of, for example, [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4671.82s)]
*  freezing wages or freezing employment [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4677.22s)]
*  when it comes to restructure the public sector, [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4679.78s)]
*  review the way they hire, they attract, [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4682.66s)]
*  the size of the government, the missions of the state. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4685.86s)]
*  This is where, in fact, it becomes... [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4688.62s)]
*  Or their appetite for that is much less. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4690.66s)]
*  And it's not because of the design of the reform programme. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4694.46s)]
*  It's with time we see less engagement. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4698.34s)]
*  And this is something that it's important, [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4702.9800000000005s)]
*  especially for the civil society, to be a partner with that. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4705.14s)]
*  Because there is always a cost for an adjustment. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4709.38s)]
*  But this cost is much lower than keeping things [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4712.7s)]
*  going into more open crisis. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4715.5s)]
*  And this is where, in fact, for those who have a long-term horizon, [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4718.5s)]
*  is to keep an eye on the reform agenda [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4723.22s)]
*  and to make sure that after stabilisation [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4725.74s)]
*  we address the structural reform. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4728.22s)]
*  And clearly, in the region, [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4730.18s)]
*  the need is not to employ more in the public sector [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4732.7s)]
*  or to have the public sector become the engine of growth. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4736.1s)]
*  The public sector or the state has to be the enabler of growth. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4739.94s)]
*  And this is something that I think we need to shift our paradigm. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4744.38s)]
*  It's not by addressing unemployment [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4748.66s)]
*  through creating jobs in the public sector [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4750.900000000001s)]
*  that in the long run we address social issues. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4753.02s)]
*  It's by making the needed reform that the state only can do [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4755.820000000001s)]
*  in order for the economy to be more productive and competitive. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4760.5s)]
*  Thank you. All right, we'll take a few questions. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4764.18s)]
*  My question is related to... [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4770.26s)]
*  Could you tell us who you are, please? [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4772.1s)]
*  I'm Yoko Saka, just a citizen, concerned citizen. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4774.14s)]
*  My question is still related to revenue. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4777.820000000001s)]
*  Government revenue is not limited to tax, user fees. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4782.540000000001s)]
*  In many governments, originally they started [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4787.14s)]
*  a railroad or electric grid or water system, [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4789.700000000001s)]
*  highway system, etc. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4793.660000000001s)]
*  It's a relatively short-term construction stage, [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4795.780000000001s)]
*  but afterwards, like a railroad, [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4798.660000000001s)]
*  provide a very stable employment afterwards. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4801.0199999999995s)]
*  So how about that subject applied to those countries? [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4804.9s)]
*  Okay, are there other questions? [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4809.299999999999s)]
*  I can take another one here, please. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4811.74s)]
*  I'm Hattem, Howard University. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4816.78s)]
*  I want to say that wage bills are political [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4819.299999999999s)]
*  regardless of where they are handled [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4825.62s)]
*  in the Middle East or the rest of the world. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4830.22s)]
*  These are very political issues. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4832.9s)]
*  And in the context of the Middle East, [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4837.02s)]
*  if I understood what Jahad was saying, [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4839.54s)]
*  it's not a question of loss of appetite [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4842.1s)]
*  after stabilization has been achieved. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4844.7s)]
*  It's the more serious political question [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4851.26s)]
*  of who's going to pay for the kind of restructuring [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4853.58s)]
*  that we are dealing with. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4857.78s)]
*  And that is not an easy answer. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4859.78s)]
*  Oh, sorry. It's not an easy answer to a very difficult question. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4864.14s)]
*  And therefore, it seems to me that, [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4868.26s)]
*  at least I haven't really looked carefully at the paper, [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4872.26s)]
*  but one of the issues that I've surmised in just looking at [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4876.34s)]
*  is that there's no distinction, for instance, [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4882.66s)]
*  in the discussion of the delivery of social services [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4886.38s)]
*  and the state sector and the role [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4890.62s)]
*  or what is expected of it in terms of the wage bill reform. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4894.1s)]
*  No discussion really of the productive sector, [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4900.18s)]
*  of the public sector, [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4903.66s)]
*  and which impacts on the working classes. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4905.3s)]
*  These are the kinds of issues that complicate [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4909.82s)]
*  the kinds of decisions that you are expecting [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4913.3s)]
*  now that stabilization has been achieved. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4915.98s)]
*  And of course, they are not technical issues. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4920.46s)]
*  They are very political issues, [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4923.78s)]
*  and therefore, they are inevitably very difficult to make. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4925.58s)]
*  OK, I'm going to... [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4933.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm not seeing another hand. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4935.7s)]
*  I'm going to throw another question of mine into the mix, [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4936.74s)]
*  and then I'd like to give each of you [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4939.66s)]
*  just a couple of minutes to respond before we finish. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4941.62s)]
*  And I just wanted to raise Iran. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4944.86s)]
*  Now, looking at Iran is covered in this report, [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4949.46s)]
*  and from what I could tell, Jihad, Iran was somehow [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4952.74s)]
*  in the middle of the pack in this region [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4955.98s)]
*  in terms of the size of its public sector, [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4958.179999999999s)]
*  the dependence on public sector employment [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4961.22s)]
*  and the size of the wage bill and so forth. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4963.74s)]
*  But maybe you can tell us better. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4965.42s)]
*  But there's just a sense that Iran, [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4967.26s)]
*  despite its many differences with the international community [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4970.900000000001s)]
*  on many issues, economically, in some ways, [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4974.78s)]
*  it's done some things that have been beneficial. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4978.22s)]
*  It's controlled the size of its population. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4983.3s)]
*  It moved at least partially from supporting some commodity subsidies [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4986.900000000001s)]
*  to cash transfer payments. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4993.82s)]
*  As I said, its public sector doesn't seem to be too much out of control, [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4995.78s)]
*  and yet we see all this unhappiness in Iran [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=4999.54s)]
*  on the part of Iranian citizens, [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5004.0599999999995s)]
*  and especially it seems to be the middle and lower classes [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5006.26s)]
*  with their economic situation. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5009.42s)]
*  So I was just wondering if you had any comment on that whole situation [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5012.139999999999s)]
*  and how it relates to the public sector in Iran. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5015.94s)]
*  But on those or any of the other points that have been raised, [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5020.0199999999995s)]
*  I want to give each of you a moment or two. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5024.26s)]
*  Amy, we can start with you. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5027.02s)]
*  Any concluding remarks you'd like to make? [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5028.58s)]
*  Okay, so I would love to see [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5030.82s)]
*  the sequence of political or economic reform go as this. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5035.26s)]
*  Like, encourage the private sector and the creation of jobs [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5039.74s)]
*  in the private sector first before curbing the public wage. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5043.9800000000005s)]
*  So people who would go out from the public wage can find employment. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5048.42s)]
*  We don't make the problem even bigger with unemployment. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5052.54s)]
*  I would like when we do the social impact of any economic reform [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5057.22s)]
*  to look at the cumulative social impact, [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5063.3s)]
*  not only to look at the social impact of the public sector reform [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5066.7s)]
*  and isolation of the other economic reforms [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5071.06s)]
*  that were introduced at the same time in the same package, [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5074.3s)]
*  because we have to look at this together. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5077.82s)]
*  I would like to see more pressure to do governance policies. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5080.860000000001s)]
*  It's like transparency is really important [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5088.740000000001s)]
*  because there is a lot of corruption, [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5091.1s)]
*  a lot of resources that are untapped for the government [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5092.900000000001s)]
*  that could have been used for social protection [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5097.1s)]
*  or even for investment to create more jobs. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5099.9800000000005s)]
*  And because of corruption, [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5102.54s)]
*  now we are tapping into the public wage [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5104.14s)]
*  instead of tapping into those things. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5106.3s)]
*  This is a very fragile region in the world, [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5109.66s)]
*  and we don't want to create any social instability, [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5112.94s)]
*  any more social instability. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5117.54s)]
*  And dialogue is really important, is a key here, [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5119.74s)]
*  especially in countries like Tunisia, where it's a very nascent democracy, [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5124.0199999999995s)]
*  and we want to give a good model in that region. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5128.74s)]
*  So dialogue is really important, including civil society, [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5131.62s)]
*  to bring everyone at the table for the government [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5134.86s)]
*  to listen to other parties, not only to the rich people, [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5137.62s)]
*  so they would not do any policies that would affect them for now. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5143.26s)]
*  So for the government to sit with all parties, [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5147.78s)]
*  because at all price, [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5150.78s)]
*  we don't want to create more instability in the region here. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5152.94s)]
*  Thank you. Teresa? [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5156.18s)]
*  Well, I think it would be nice if it were always possible [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5158.14s)]
*  to find the fiscal space to support a high-wage bill [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5163.26s)]
*  and at the same time, [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5168.780000000001s)]
*  while the private sector improves and creates more jobs. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5170.54s)]
*  The fact of the matter is that in many of the countries, [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5180.38s)]
*  this sort of fiscal space just is not there. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5184.22s)]
*  And if you don't reduce the wage bill or sort of stem its growth, [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5187.34s)]
*  which has been in many of the countries of the region [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5192.66s)]
*  still very high from a high base in the last few years, [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5195.3s)]
*  you are simply not going to create the room for the private sector to grow. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5200.5s)]
*  And also, you're going to contain or limit the scope [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5207.26s)]
*  for increasing expenditures of, for instance, our infrastructure, [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5215.3s)]
*  which are necessary for the public sector, [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5219.5s)]
*  for the private sector to grow. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5222.14s)]
*  So, I mean, there are difficult choices to be made. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5224.3s)]
*  And I agree very much with the paper position [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5228.82s)]
*  that the judgment has to be sort of country-specific, [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5232.7s)]
*  taking into account a number of considerations. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5236.66s)]
*  That said, one has to look at all the... [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5243.54s)]
*  This paper has been concentrating on the public sector wages, [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5247.9400000000005s)]
*  but it's not to say that there aren't other issues [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5251.26s)]
*  in the public sector management [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5255.46s)]
*  in terms of revenue mobilisation, [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5257.54s)]
*  in terms of cutting evasion, reducing corruption, [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5260.9400000000005s)]
*  or including transparency. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5265.22s)]
*  All of these issues are very much on the agenda. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5266.780000000001s)]
*  And I'm sure that the staff of the Middle East Department [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5269.38s)]
*  looks at this in individual country circumstances [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5273.94s)]
*  and tries to make the best sort of judgment possible [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5278.219999999999s)]
*  and the best combination, [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5284.219999999999s)]
*  or at least to recommend to the countries. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5286.78s)]
*  One should also not forget that the effectiveness [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5290.46s)]
*  of the fund surveillance is different in different countries. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5294.54s)]
*  In some, they have more leverage [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5302.42s)]
*  because the country is borrowing from the fund. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5305.78s)]
*  And there, perhaps, is the responsibility of the department [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5309.02s)]
*  to make these trade-offs when necessary is greater. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5314.02s)]
*  In other cases, it can provide the best advice, [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5320.7s)]
*  but the authorities may choose for political reasons [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5323.38s)]
*  or ideological reasons, in some cases, to go another way. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5327.54s)]
*  So one shouldn't always put the blame at the door of the fund. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5334.46s)]
*  Fiyad? [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5342.3s)]
*  Well, two general remarks and then a few specific ones. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5343.46s)]
*  This paper is part of several analytical work [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5350.54s)]
*  that we're doing in order to see how we can improve [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5355.78s)]
*  the inclusiveness and the level of growth [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5359.5s)]
*  to address issues of the region. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5361.62s)]
*  Therefore, it's not the one and only policy recommendation [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5363.66s)]
*  that we have. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5368.94s)]
*  It's part of a puzzle or group of policies. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5370.099999999999s)]
*  Some of them are fiscal, and I mentioned a few of them [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5375.66s)]
*  on the subsidy reform as well as also on the tax reform. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5379.82s)]
*  But also there are other policy work that we're doing. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5383.099999999999s)]
*  And then, as a matter of fact, at the end of the month, [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5388.9s)]
*  we will have an important conference in Marrakesh [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5391.5s)]
*  about inclusive growth, especially dedicated to look at [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5394.98s)]
*  how we can, in fact, put in practice what people are aspiring [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5398.46s)]
*  and what we have been trying to achieve for years now [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5402.7s)]
*  since the last decade on these aspects. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5407.98s)]
*  Therefore, this is part of a broader picture. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5410.74s)]
*  Second, we look at this as a way to open, in fact, [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5414.74s)]
*  the reform agenda on the public sector, [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5420.3s)]
*  role, functions, cost, benefits. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5425.62s)]
*  And we believe that the wage bill is a good entry point. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5429.26s)]
*  And as I said, we are at crossroads. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5432.74s)]
*  Government services are going to change [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5436.58s)]
*  and the role of the state is going to change. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5438.62s)]
*  The needs for additional investment in education, health, [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5441.7s)]
*  are in a region where demography and where, in fact, [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5446.42s)]
*  social indicators are not as good, [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5451.74s)]
*  would require to pay some more attention. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5454.14s)]
*  Looking at the wage bill as a financial reflection [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5457.46s)]
*  of the efficiency of the state is a good starting point [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5463.94s)]
*  to see, are we doing well on education? [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5468.22s)]
*  Are we doing well on providing tax services? [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5470.900000000001s)]
*  Therefore, this is, I think, how also we need to look at this paper. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5474.5s)]
*  Therefore, we should not shy away from looking at this paper [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5480.02s)]
*  as a first step into broader improvement in governance [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5487.34s)]
*  and have greater accountability on how we spend public money. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5492.46s)]
*  This is my first comment. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5497.86s)]
*  The second comment is, there is a third player in the room [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5499.74s)]
*  that also we need to listen to. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5505.14s)]
*  And Teresa alluded to, private sector. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5507.82s)]
*  Those people need to create jobs. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5510.26s)]
*  And need to make sure that the state is, in fact, helping them, [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5512.46s)]
*  creating the enabling environment for them to create jobs. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5515.46s)]
*  So infrastructure, good quality of services, [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5518.82s)]
*  proper taxation, etc. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5521.46s)]
*  And this is where, in fact, growth will come [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5523.66s)]
*  and part of the social inclusion will be. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5527.26s)]
*  Those are my general comments. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5530.1s)]
*  Specifically, sequencing, I agree, [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5532.58s)]
*  sequencing is something that has to be country-specific [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5534.740000000001s)]
*  in the wage bill reform [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5539.780000000001s)]
*  and also on the urgency for those countries. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5541.860000000001s)]
*  Because we don't work in an absolute world. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5545.820000000001s)]
*  There are constraints on the ground. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5550.18s)]
*  Countries are different for the country that has wealth [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5552.42s)]
*  and buffers, they have the chance of taking maybe more time. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5555.22s)]
*  Countries where you have high level of demographic growth, [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5560.46s)]
*  pressure is higher. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5564.660000000001s)]
*  Impact assessment, I totally agree that the impact assessment [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5567.38s)]
*  could not be segmented in a way [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5571.22s)]
*  that doesn't take into consideration other policy implications. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5575.34s)]
*  And this is, in fact, something that we try to pay attention to, [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5579.18s)]
*  is the right policy mix. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5583.82s)]
*  Sometimes one of the instruments is giving maybe the highlight of the media [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5585.66s)]
*  and this makes us feel frustrated [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5591.58s)]
*  because we have many policies that we are putting in the reform program [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5593.86s)]
*  and guess what, one element is only picked and put out of context. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5599.3s)]
*  And this is, I agree, the impact assessment is important. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5603.62s)]
*  Fragility of the region. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5608.099999999999s)]
*  I think what the region has shown in the last ten years is the resiliency. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5610.38s)]
*  In parallel to the fragility. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5614.9400000000005s)]
*  For a region to be subjected to a sequence, high frequency of shocks, [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5618.06s)]
*  financial crisis, drop in oil price, [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5623.78s)]
*  Arab Spring impact, in certain cases refugees, [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5627.9400000000005s)]
*  the region was able to hold together. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5632.900000000001s)]
*  And when you look at the level of growth, for example, in 2017, [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5635.9400000000005s)]
*  you would be surprised to see some of the producing countries, [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5639.5s)]
*  oil importing countries, are growing at four, four and a half, [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5643.62s)]
*  with the expectation to reach five, [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5646.74s)]
*  which in fact the level of growth that we used to have in the first decade of the 2000s. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5648.74s)]
*  Therefore, we need to strengthen this resiliency [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5653.9s)]
*  because in parallel with this resiliency there are fragilities. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5657.38s)]
*  And the issue is the fragilities are coming, [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5661.02s)]
*  and I will go back to your question on Iran, [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5663.7s)]
*  on those who are not part of the system. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5666.42s)]
*  Those who have a public sector employment, they have a safety net. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5668.46s)]
*  They have a salary at the end of the month, [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5672.1s)]
*  they have social protection and they have pension. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5674.18s)]
*  Those who in fact are suffering most, [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5676.7s)]
*  especially when you do adjustment, [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5681.58s)]
*  are those who are not part of any protection system. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5683.1s)]
*  And those are the people that we need to look at. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5686.22s)]
*  And it's a trade-off. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5689.9s)]
*  Resources are limited, you need to distribute them in an efficient and in an equitable way. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5692.3s)]
*  And this is why I think it's very important to... [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5696.94s)]
*  I know and we all know that... [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5700.78s)]
*  public sector employment provides political weight [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5706.0199999999995s)]
*  because those are groups that are politically listened to. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5709.82s)]
*  But I think it's our role also to think of those who are not [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5715.179999999999s)]
*  provided with the same level of protection. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5719.82s)]
*  They need it. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5722.86s)]
*  Various reports are showing that the level of inequality is growing. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5725.34s)]
*  And therefore, part of addressing those inequalities is through fiscal measures. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5729.9400000000005s)]
*  And then we need to create the space for that. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5734.9400000000005s)]
*  Otherwise, it's becoming very difficult to have realistic ambition [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5737.42s)]
*  on addressing some of those social issues. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5741.7s)]
*  Well, Jad, I think you summed it up when you said a couple of minutes ago [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5744.22s)]
*  that the role of the state in this region is going to change. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5748.58s)]
*  It's going to change. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5752.66s)]
*  And clearly, the era in which public sector employment [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5753.98s)]
*  is either a social welfare scheme or a scheme of political control [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5757.219999999999s)]
*  or... This is all passing away. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5765.099999999999s)]
*  But of course, the transition to something different [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5768.219999999999s)]
*  where the public sector is about providing services to citizens [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5771.379999999999s)]
*  and enabling the private sector rather than constraining it, [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5775.099999999999s)]
*  this is by no means an easy change. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5777.98s)]
*  So I want to thank you all, Jihad Azur, Teresa Terminacian and Amy Akhdawi, [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5781.98s)]
*  for this great discussion. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5788.099999999999s)]
*  Congratulations on the report. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5790.82s)]
*  And thanks very much for launching it here. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5792.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0URN7TDyeg&t=5795.0599999999995s)]
