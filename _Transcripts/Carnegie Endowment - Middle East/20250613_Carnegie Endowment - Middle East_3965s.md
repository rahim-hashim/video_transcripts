Video Description: The Middle East is in turmoil. In the past several years, the ongoing war in Gaza, the restructuring of governments in Lebanon and Syria, and the Houthis’ activities in Yemen have exacerbated regional instability and highlighted the lack of security coordination by both regional and external actors. However, there have also been significant moments of collaboration as well, such as the Palestine Summit and Egypt’s subsequent reconstruction plan for Gaza.  
In this two-part event, Congressman Joe Wilson will offer his perspective on the role of the United States in regional security in the Middle East, including challenges of and opportunities for preserving its economic and security interests in the region and what the United States ought to be doing  to  promote general stability. 
The policymaker conversation will be followed by a panel discussion of Middle East scholars who will debate both America’s role, and the roles of regional state and non-state actors within the region. Amr Hamzawy and Frederic Wehrey, senior fellows with the Carnegie Middle East Program, and Mona Yacoubian, senior advisor and director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, will also consider questions such as how to pursue a path to stability amongst the actors in the region and the potential for a regional collective security organization.

# Perspectives on Regional Security in the Middle East
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c)
*  you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=0.0s)]

*  Nana [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=42.92s)]
*  is [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=48.28s)]
*  to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=50.36s)]
*  attend [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=54.1s)]
*  the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=57.64s)]
*  All right. I think we will get started. Welcome everyone to the Carnegie Endowment for International [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=59.26s)]
*  Peace. My name is Sarah Yerkes. I'm a senior fellow here in the Middle East program. And [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=70.14s)]
*  we are really delighted to welcome you here for what will be, I think, a very exciting [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=74.82s)]
*  two-part event where first we'll start off part one with a fabulous panel who I will [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=78.94s)]
*  momentarily followed by a conversation between Amr Hamzawi and Representative Joe Wilson, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=85.02s)]
*  which should be really, really fascinating. And both of these are focused on this topic [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=90.61999999999999s)]
*  of regional security in the Middle East and North Africa. This could not have come at [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=94.78s)]
*  a more, I think, interesting time, although times are interesting all the time, I think, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=99.61999999999999s)]
*  in the Middle East. But we will certainly be talking about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=104.1s)]
*  about Iran, about potential conflict there, about everything that has been happening of [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=109.18s)]
*  late. A couple of housekeeping issues. First of all, if you want to ask a question, you [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=113.5s)]
*  have a QR code on your seat if you are here with us in person. And for those of you online, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=118.58000000000001s)]
*  you can enter your questions into the YouTube comments. Please feel free to put questions [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=124.56s)]
*  in at any time, and we will take those later on. And finally, I just want to highlight [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=128.5s)]
*  that this project, that this discussion today comes out of a new work stream that we're [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=134.06s)]
*  doing here in the Middle East program at Carnegie that's focusing on regional security. It's [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=138.76s)]
*  led by my colleagues Amr and Fred, and there are some publications that are outside if [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=143.6s)]
*  you haven't had a chance to pick them up and also available on our website. So with that, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=148.48s)]
*  let me introduce our fabulous panel. We have really just four incredible experts with us [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=153.36s)]
*  to talk about different aspects of regional security. First, we have Karim Sajjapor, senior [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=158.54s)]
*  fellow in the Middle East program here at Carnegie. We then have Mona Yakubian, who [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=162.98s)]
*  is currently the senior advisor and director of the Middle East program at the Center for [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=166.52s)]
*  Strategic and International Studies, CSIS. Amr Hamzawi, the director and senior fellow [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=170.96s)]
*  in the Middle East program at Carnegie. And Fred Weary, also senior fellow in the Middle [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=176.18s)]
*  East program at Carnegie. So we have pretty much the entire Middle East program at Carnegie [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  right now. I'm actually going to jump off and start with you, Mona. And the question [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  I wanted to ask you is, is it even possible to build security in the region without addressing [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Or is the regional stalemate unavoidable as long as [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=194.84s)]
*  that conflict persists? I mean, I think it's exceptionally difficult to do that. I think [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=199.04s)]
*  there has to be demonstrable progress toward a resolution. I think, you know, to be kind [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=204.48s)]
*  of clear-eyed about it, this is clearly going to take a long time after the terrorist attack [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=211.12s)]
*  on October 7th and then the ensuing conflict in Gaza, even longer. We know that both parties [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=217.23999999999998s)]
*  and populations, both Israeli and Palestinian, are in a sense further away from, you know, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=224.76s)]
*  being open to cooperation and a two-state solution. So the road is going to be long, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=231.16s)]
*  but it's really very, very difficult to imagine how the region can move ahead with respect [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=237.64s)]
*  to security and stability in the absence of concrete progress in shorthand Gaza. And the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=244.2s)]
*  only comment else I'd make on this is, you know, we've seen since October 7th and the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  ensuing conflict in Gaza, we've seen these flashpoints erupt all across the Middle East, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=257.36s)]
*  Lebanon, Syria, Iraq to a lesser extent, the Houthis in the Red Sea, and of course even, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=263.36s)]
*  and I'm sure Karim's going to talk about this, direct confrontation between Israel and Iran, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=270.28s)]
*  essentially being crossed. So we should have no illusion that there can be regional stability [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=276.96s)]
*  in the absence of this long-standing conflict, at least moving more towards some sort of [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=283.64s)]
*  resolution. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=289.96s)]
*  Great. Thank you. I want to turn to you next, Omar, to ask you if there are points of convergence [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=290.96s)]
*  between the regional powers, and here we're talking about Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Israel, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=296.88s)]
*  Iran, Egypt, UAE, and Qatar in regard to building security and preventing conflict. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=301.32s)]
*  Thank you so much, Sarah, and it's a pleasure to join the Middle East program and Mona. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=306.52s)]
*  I'm honored actually to be included with you all. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=311.52s)]
*  We're honored to have you. Yes. So let me start by saying I do agree with Mona's assessment [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=314.52s)]
*  that it's extremely difficult to see collective security arrangements emerging in the Middle [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=322.24s)]
*  East and North Africa without factoring in the significance of at least moving the parties [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=328.32s)]
*  engaged in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the direction of some sort of conflict [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=337.88s)]
*  resolution, some sort of even a negotiated temporary ceasefire arrangement that would [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=343.04s)]
*  ease tensions that have erupted in the region everywhere since October 7th, two years ago. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=350.04s)]
*  We have seen how the different zones of tensions, instability of military conflict have erupted [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=363.08000000000004s)]
*  in the region, and when we had a ceasefire arrangement in January of 25, they came to [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=371.08s)]
*  at least a brief moment of stabilization. The points of convergence between different [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=380.44s)]
*  regional actors and the big middle powers or the big regional actors are, as you've [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=387.44s)]
*  named them, Sarah, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar, Iran, Turkey, Egypt, and the Middle [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=391.44s)]
*  East, Egypt, Israel, of course. I believe for different purposes all of them have an [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=400.64s)]
*  interest in regionalizing security, no longer being dependent on what the U.S. can offer [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=407.64s)]
*  in terms of its military presence, its diplomatic power, its push for negotiated settlements, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=414.64s)]
*  especially because I believe as of now we do not know whether the U.S. would like to [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=422.68s)]
*  invest diplomatically or militarily heavily in pushing the region in the direction of [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=427.32s)]
*  peaceful settlements of the different erupted conflicts. So that is the first point of convergence. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=434.32s)]
*  A second point of convergence is, and I believe here most middle powers in the region, and [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=440.36s)]
*  I believe including Iran, but I would love to hear Kareem's take on it, are operating [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=447.52s)]
*  based on an Israel-Palestine plus approach. I mean, questions of regional security are [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=452.71999999999997s)]
*  not only reduced to Israel and Palestine. That's one of the big takeaways of the last [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=457.47999999999996s)]
*  two years. When you look at Saudi diplomacy, at the UAE foreign policy, at Egypt's foreign [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=461.96s)]
*  policy, at Turkey, I mean, you look at Saudi Arabia and Turkey, and Syria plays a huge [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=468.12s)]
*  role for both of them. You look at Iran and maybe questions of their relation with different [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=472.84s)]
*  non-state actors across the region are as significant as the way they look at Palestine [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=478.8s)]
*  and Israel. And the same goes for Egypt, which is challenged not only in Gaza, but in Sudan [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=485.84000000000003s)]
*  and Libya and elsewhere. So I believe a second point of convergence is the Israel-Palestine [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=491.56s)]
*  plus approach to regional security. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=496.12s)]
*  Great. Thank you. Speaking of Iran, I want to bring you and Kareem to ask, first of all, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=498.52s)]
*  in what ways has Iran tried to regionalize its security, but also a sort of separate [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=503.24s)]
*  question of the moment, which is how serious should we take this threat of Israel on Iran? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=507.28000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. It's great to be with all of you. I would first distinguish between the ideological [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=512.28s)]
*  objectives of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the national interests and security interests [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=519.6800000000001s)]
*  of the Iranian nation. So the ideological objectives of the Islamic Republic of Iran [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=524.72s)]
*  from 1979 to the present, it's, you know, evict America from the Middle East, replace [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=529.12s)]
*  Israel with Palestine, try to bring down the U.S.-led world order. I don't think those [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=535.32s)]
*  reflect the national interests of Iran, national interests being that which advances the security [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=539.88s)]
*  and prosperity of your people. So really what this regime is thinking about are its ideological [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=544.8s)]
*  objectives, which obviously are not, it's security, but it's more about regime survival, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=552.04s)]
*  right? And so there was, it's been said about Russia, that Russia seeks security and the [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=558.1999999999999s)]
*  insecurity of its neighbors. And I think that very much applies to Iran as well. If you [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=565.8s)]
*  look at the five places that Iran was dominating up until about six months ago, Syria, Lebanon, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=569.76s)]
*  Iraq, Yemen, Gaza, all failed, failing states. So Iran thrives in atmospheres of profound [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=577.1999999999999s)]
*  insecurity, weak governments, they've proven very effective at filling power vacuums. These [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=584.4000000000001s)]
*  are power vacuums which, you know, we created some of them, like the Iraq War, the Arab [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=591.6s)]
*  uprisings of 2011 created others. And I think that Iran is still very much committed to [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=596.6s)]
*  that strategy, even though they've suffered some serious blows over the last couple months. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=602.6s)]
*  I think the intent is still there, although the capacity has been diminished. In terms [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=608.08s)]
*  of the moment we're in right now, you know, I think I was telling Sarah or Fred earlier [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=613.76s)]
*  that over the last couple months, the public discussion about Iran and these nuclear negotiations, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=618.96s)]
*  it kind of veers from hopes of an imminent deal to fears of an imminent attack. And it [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=626.0s)]
*  just kind of is like a pendulum which goes back and forth. I've never thought a deal [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=633.0s)]
*  was going to be imminent. You know, if you recall, it took the Obama administration about [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=637.0600000000001s)]
*  three years to negotiate JPOA and then JCPOA. And I also think just based on the president's [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=640.86s)]
*  public statements that, you know, he's made very clear that he's not interested in getting [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=648.9s)]
*  involved in another conflict in the Middle East and he wants to resolve this issue diplomatically. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=654.72s)]
*  Frankly, I think if it were up to President Trump, he would love a Nixon to China moment [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=659.26s)]
*  with Iran. He would love to go to Tehran and normalize relations. That's not going [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=663.26s)]
*  to happen because the Iranians are not amenable to that. But I'm not, let me put it this way, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=667.8199999999999s)]
*  I don't think the likelihood of a comprehensive deal is high. And I think that both Tehran [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=675.86s)]
*  and Washington want to avoid conflict. And I think the most likely outcome in the coming [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=683.14s)]
*  months, in my view, is similar to what we saw with the JPOA, the precursor to the JCPOA, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=689.26s)]
*  which is kind of a limited interim deal, which never becomes comprehensive. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=695.26s)]
*  Thank you. And then finally, Fred, I wanted to bring you in to look a bit at the U.S. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=699.38s)]
*  perspective. And what benefit would regionalizing security in the region bring from a U.S. interest [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=705.3s)]
*  perspective? And how much of these different arrangements we've been talking about are [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=710.54s)]
*  due to the U.S. withdrawal from the Middle East space? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=713.9s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think it would benefit the U.S. And I think the U.S. really has no choice [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=718.02s)]
*  but to accept this regionalization of security. I mean, this trend of local agency, of local [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=721.86s)]
*  states taking matters into their own hands has been going on for quite some time. We [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=727.82s)]
*  can talk about its roots in the pandemic and then doubts about U.S. commitment. But the [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=732.14s)]
*  fact of the matter is, there's a new center of gravity emerging in the region. It's more [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=737.38s)]
*  multipolar. It's more multi-aligned. You have smaller middle states engaging in detente, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=741.66s)]
*  ceasefires, mediation. And so, you know, the U.S. has to accept it. It also has to accept [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=747.46s)]
*  some degree of internationalization of security and the fact that the region is becoming more [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=752.34s)]
*  multi-aligned. The U.S. is still dominant in certain spheres, but it no longer maintains [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=757.22s)]
*  exclusivity over certain spheres of influence. I think all of this is a benefit. Look, the [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=762.46s)]
*  U.S. has been trying to pivot away from this region for so long in terms of reallocating [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=768.78s)]
*  material resources, military resources, policy bandwidth to other priorities, getting its [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=774.5s)]
*  troops out of harm's way while still preserving some access and influence. And it wants to [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=780.54s)]
*  spur local states to own more of their security. So I think all these trends are for the good. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=789.04s)]
*  I want to add some caveats. The U.S. should be asking itself, what kind of stability and [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=795.5s)]
*  peace is being delivered by these deals? Is it an enduring peace that really gets at the [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=801.42s)]
*  roots of the conflict? Because the region's history is replete with bargains and deals [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=807.08s)]
*  that simply reconfigure conflicts. They don't address the root causes. And so, peace with [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=813.14s)]
*  justice. We shouldn't conflate reconstruction or recovery with enduring peace settlements. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=818.3s)]
*  And I think this is the thing we really need to scrutinize. And here I'm talking about [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=825.42s)]
*  the issue of displaced persons, refugees, and sort of revanchous settlements that we [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=829.9799999999999s)]
*  see across the region. I think we also have to keep in mind that the architects of this [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=834.54s)]
*  new regional order, the states that are engaging in this peacemaking, are deeply problematic [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=841.3s)]
*  in some ways. I mean, they're authoritarian. They have problems at home with their own [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=847.5799999999999s)]
*  governance. And so, there's also an issue where a state can play a positive role in [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=851.82s)]
*  one conflict and be pouring gasoline on the fire in another one. And we've seen that as [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=855.62s)]
*  well. And so, we shouldn't ignore that with certain players in the region. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=859.82s)]
*  The last thing I'll close on is how do we institutionalize these deals, right? And so, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=863.82s)]
*  as Amar said, the region has lacked a formal security structure like the OSCE. There's [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=869.6600000000001s)]
*  been various multiple attempts at doing this. But each one of these initiatives is often [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=876.66s)]
*  owned by one state in the region, and it's used for a specific purpose. So, there's not [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=883.18s)]
*  really an inclusive structure that includes all the countries in the region. And so, what [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=888.1s)]
*  role can the US play in nudging that along? Should we play a role? And the last thing [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=893.18s)]
*  I'll end on is how do we address some of these nontraditional challenges? Obviously, we need [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=897.86s)]
*  to focus on stopping shooting wars, right, ending hostilities. But the region's real [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=905.38s)]
*  roots of instability often reside within states. There are transnational challenges, climate [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=910.46s)]
*  change, corruption, authoritarianism, all these things that are so hard to address with [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=916.22s)]
*  sort of bargains and deals. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=922.02s)]
*  Thank you. I think you bring up a couple of really important points that I want to pick [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=924.54s)]
*  up on and have others come in. And one is about this idea of lasting and enduring peace. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=926.74s)]
*  I want to have you all offer your thoughts. Feel free to reflect on other things that [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=931.34s)]
*  were said as well. But how likely are these types of new arrangements to provide the sort [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=936.0600000000001s)]
*  of lasting and enduring peace that Fred is talking about? And then what do you think [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=941.66s)]
*  is the US role? I mean, should the US be pushing for this, standing back, staying out of the [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=945.14s)]
*  way? I mean, what are some responses? Maybe we'll start with you, Kareem. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=949.86s)]
*  Sure. I'm assuming you're talking about the Abraham Accords, among other things? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=952.82s)]
*  That's one of them, yeah. I mean, the notion that that was sort of seen as a lodestar of [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=957.5s)]
*  what's going to solve all the problems and certain things were attached with it. And [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=962.02s)]
*  the other thing is it's also sort of bled into an effort to keep China out of the reach. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=965.18s)]
*  So the degree to which the US attaches things to these sort of local deals. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=969.66s)]
*  So I'm going to reveal my biases here. And I remember when I first came to DC as a graduate [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=975.26s)]
*  student, it was on the eve of the Iraq War. And there was a debate about whether the road [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=982.5s)]
*  to peace in the Middle East went through Baghdad or Jerusalem. You probably remember this. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=987.86s)]
*  What is the most important thing to do to bring peace and stability to the Middle East? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=992.58s)]
*  Is it to remove Saddam Hussein from power or resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=996.7s)]
*  In my view, if you only have one arrow to use and you have to pick one big problem to try to [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1004.2s)]
*  resolve to bring stability to this region, it's my view that we're never going to have lasting [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1015.1600000000001s)]
*  stability in the Middle East so long as you have a government in Iran whose organizing principle [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1022.5200000000001s)]
*  is revolutionary ideology of 1979 rather than the national interests of its people. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1028.72s)]
*  And so I'm sure others would disagree with that. But Iran is a very big, powerful, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1035.56s)]
*  wealthy country. And as long as they spend their enormous resources funding proxies [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1042.16s)]
*  thrive in instability. A strong Lebanese government is inimical to the interests of Hezbollah. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1053.24s)]
*  A functional Palestinian government is inimical to the interests of Palestinian Islamic Jihad. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1059.8s)]
*  A functional, strong Iraqi government is inimical to the interests of the Shia militias in Iraq. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1064.64s)]
*  I'm skeptical that... So in some ways I'm agreeing with you, Fred, that when the news of the Abraham [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1069.68s)]
*  Accords came about, I thought, you know, that's fine. But the idea that this now transforms the [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1078.76s)]
*  region is going to bring peace and stability. I was always skeptical. Let me emphasize one thing, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1085.16s)]
*  which is I'm not talking about Iran's transition to Denmark, right, to become Norway or Denmark. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1090.92s)]
*  I'm just talking about a transition to a government whose organizing principle is the interests of the [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1098.04s)]
*  nation, not revolutionary ideology. That could be under... It doesn't have to necessarily be under [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1104.94s)]
*  representative government. Thank you. Mona, would you like to come in? Yeah, I mean, I think a few [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1110.6200000000001s)]
*  things come to mind. One, I'm going to sort of contradict myself in terms of where I started, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1116.1000000000001s)]
*  which is, yes, significant progress toward resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1122.38s)]
*  in my view, is a sine qua non for the region to really integrate security-wise and find stability. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1129.3s)]
*  Similarly, by the way, with Iran as well. And I do want to push back on one thing you said initially, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1138.1s)]
*  Karim. But so therefore I think in a way we have to lower our sights a bit. And, you know, I think [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1143.74s)]
*  if we put out there enduring peace as the goal, we're not going to go very far here. So I think we [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1150.3799999999999s)]
*  have to talk about baby steps. We have to talk about de-escalation and stabilization. And there, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1157.98s)]
*  I think, there are enormous opportunities. And I really want to pull on what both Amir and Fred [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1164.34s)]
*  said, because I strongly agree that in my view we are at a hinge moment in the region. We're at a [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1170.1s)]
*  point where the order that had pertained, you know, 20 years ago is really vanishing, if not vanished [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1177.14s)]
*  entirely, and there's a new order emerging. And that new order, I think, is characterized by a much [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1183.42s)]
*  greater degree of regional agency to drive these changes, to drive problem-solving. And in that [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1189.3400000000001s)]
*  regard, and I think the region, and I would include Iran in this, is interested in de-escalating [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1199.1000000000001s)]
*  tension. And we can we could have a little back and forth on that. But you see the rapprochement, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1204.42s)]
*  for example, between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Yeah, in the Gulf, I think they are. Yeah, they are, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1210.34s)]
*  which was not the case, by the way, back in 2015, where the Gulf was deeply opposed to. So the region [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1215.4599999999998s)]
*  is owning much more. And for that, I'm actually optimistic, because I think that therefore there's [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1221.54s)]
*  this organic drive from within the region to start to solve the problems. The US may not always be [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1227.1399999999999s)]
*  open to it, but I think we don't have a choice. And I'm not sure we are interested. I mean, we've [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1233.98s)]
*  been trying desperately, the US, to pivot, right, for administration upon administration. Well, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1239.34s)]
*  the pivot is now perhaps being forced upon us, or it's happening. What I think is critical, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1245.9399999999998s)]
*  though, is that the US and others help shape and catalyze some of these shifts, certainly as an [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1251.1799999999998s)]
*  American in a way that redounds to US national security interests, but also in a way that [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1259.1399999999999s)]
*  actually anchors stability. So in particular, I'd say let's look at stabilization prospects [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1262.98s)]
*  in Lebanon and in Syria. Both countries really, in my view, are on the stand at the threshold of [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1270.3s)]
*  unparalleled opportunity to stabilize and get on to trajectories that move those countries both [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1277.66s)]
*  towards stability and reform. At the same time, the challenges are enormous in both places. And [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1285.98s)]
*  there are spoilers all around waiting to take advantage of missteps. This is where I think the [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1294.38s)]
*  US and the international community needs to play a really important role in how those stabilization [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1299.22s)]
*  processes move forward, acknowledging that we're not going to be the ones putting the money on the [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1308.78s)]
*  table. This is not Iraq redux. This is going to be really funded by the Gulf and others. So I think [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1313.7s)]
*  the region is really at this incredible crossroads that could lead toward greater stability, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1320.42s)]
*  de-escalated tensions, if managed well. If not, I think we can easily see falling back into conflict [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1327.82s)]
*  in several places that right now are in a slightly more de-escalated spot. Thank you. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1337.26s)]
*  Amr? Thank you, Sarah. Let me start by adding a couple of points to the eminent risks I see in [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1344.06s)]
*  the current geostrategic environment in the Middle East and North Africa. One, I believe, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1353.46s)]
*  and it really all goes back to the lessons and the impacts, lessons we've been learning, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1359.82s)]
*  states, actors in the region have been learning from the last two years, a bit more than two years [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1369.58s)]
*  since October 7, 2023, as well as the impacts of the ongoing conflict in the region. One, clearly, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1374.78s)]
*  we are witnessing a geostrategic environment in which we have an unprecedented asymmetry of [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1385.18s)]
*  power between state actors, and this needs to be factored in. And it's not only about Israel on [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1391.58s)]
*  the one hand and Iran on the other hand. It's about state actors in the region and the emerging [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1397.8999999999999s)]
*  asymmetry of power, military power, and its impacts. Secondly, I see multiple signs of an [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1403.98s)]
*  armed race unfolding in the region, very similar to what we had before in the 1950s and 1960s, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1411.74s)]
*  and a bit in the 1970s. And when you put it in a historical context, this is an extremely worrying [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1417.8200000000002s)]
*  sign. A third risk which I see emerging or continues to be relevant geostrategically, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1423.3400000000001s)]
*  not emerging now, is the ongoing duality of state and non-state actors. This is one of the very few [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1430.8600000000001s)]
*  regions in today's world where foreign policy is not only made by state actors, it's made by non-state [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1438.7s)]
*  actors as well. Hezbollah in Lebanon has for a very long time made foreign policy for Lebanon. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1444.94s)]
*  Hamas, other groups in Palestine, have for a very long time made foreign policy for the Palestinian [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1450.7s)]
*  people. And the same goes for Iraqi militias and the Hussis in Yemen and so on and so forth. So [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1456.22s)]
*  these risks should not be ignored and they need to be looked at in line of the impacts of the last [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1462.7s)]
*  two years. I believe state actors in the region, especially the middle powers, and it would include [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1471.5s)]
*  Iran by the way in this assessment, have come to learn that ongoing escalation at the end of the [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1476.78s)]
*  day harms their interests. I believe Iran, I stand to be correct of course, and Karim is the expert [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1484.46s)]
*  on Iran. It's very difficult for me to see Iran's foreign policy now as being identical to Iran's [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1491.82s)]
*  foreign policy towards the Middle East prior to October 7, 2023. I see signs of rapprochement [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1501.26s)]
*  with the Gulf, but I see also signs with rapprochement with Egypt, with Jordan, and elsewhere. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1506.7s)]
*  A degree of de-escalation, a push for de-escalation that's happening regionally in Iran's foreign [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1512.54s)]
*  policy behavior in the region. Did it happen before October 7, 2023? I believe it was not the [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1518.22s)]
*  case. There was a one-off agreement which was relevant between the Saudis and the Iranians. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1523.82s)]
*  So I believe state actors in the region are reading the signs and the impacts as pushing [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1529.18s)]
*  them to regionalize security not to be dependent on what the U.S. can offer or what China can offer [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1534.78s)]
*  in competition with the U.S. but to regionalize security. They realize the risks and ongoing [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1541.5s)]
*  imminent dangers of an arms race, of state-non-state actors, dualities, and so on and so forth. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1547.9s)]
*  And finally, there are even some initial moves to figure out a diplomatic framework [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1553.26s)]
*  which is here not Israel-Palestine Plus, it's Arab League Plus, where there are some attempts to [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1560.14s)]
*  figure out a way of setting forward a diplomatic framework for negotiations. I'm not sure how [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1566.62s)]
*  successful it's going to be given Fred's excellent point on the history on the track record which [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1572.06s)]
*  has been negative with regard to collective security efforts. But maybe this needs to be [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1576.54s)]
*  looked at. All of it to go back to Mona's point that I am hopeful as well. The region is at a [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1582.3s)]
*  crossroads and it's definitely not going to happen away from regional agency. So we have to take [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1587.82s)]
*  regional agency very seriously. Thank you. Fred, did you want to respond to anything that was said? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1594.86s)]
*  Yeah, I mean just to go back to the sort of role of the U.S. and other outside [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1600.6999999999998s)]
*  powers. I think as we've seen the de-escalation is emerging organically and it should and these [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1604.86s)]
*  peace deals, it's great the region is taking them on. I do think outside [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1610.3s)]
*  states can play a role in guaranteeing the settlements in, you know, on your paper where [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1614.4599999999998s)]
*  you identified the end of the Iran-Iraq War and the TAF agreement. Those were both made possible [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1620.3s)]
*  by outside agreements and support and I think that's a critical role for outside states to play. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1624.62s)]
*  I would also say when we're talking about stabilization and I agree we shouldn't set our [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1630.9399999999998s)]
*  sights too high but at the same time I think there's a history in this region where we've been in a [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1636.6999999999998s)]
*  stabilization mode for so long. We've been in a transition period in Libya, right? And so we [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1641.26s)]
*  shouldn't deceive ourselves that just because it's relatively stable doesn't mean there's [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1647.5s)]
*  real problems of justice and inequity and that these things can blow up at any time. And so how [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1652.06s)]
*  do you build inclusive institutions? How do you build the rule of law? That's not simply a question [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1656.78s)]
*  of funding from the Gulf and so I think handing the sort of reconstruction and stabilization [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1662.7s)]
*  piece over to the states with deep pockets and the oil wealth, I don't think that's necessarily [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1668.22s)]
*  going to get us there and I do think, again, the U.S. comes under so much criticism for what it's [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1674.46s)]
*  done and its nation building and its behavior in the region but I do think we had certain [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1680.38s)]
*  capabilities with USAID, the Office of Transition Initiatives, the Conflict and Stabilization Bureau, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1685.42s)]
*  we had the know-how to insert ourselves into these post-conflict scenarios and move the ball [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1691.66s)]
*  forward and unfortunately that capability is now gone and I think that's one of your questions is [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1698.3000000000002s)]
*  what's the impact of our aid cuts on this whole environment? Yeah, sorry, Mona and then Karin. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1703.74s)]
*  Yeah, I just wanted to jump in. So I want to clarify that I certainly don't think that [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1709.1s)]
*  handing over wholesale the stabilization process to deep-pocketed Gulf actors is a smart way to go. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1713.58s)]
*  In fact, what I hope I was clearly said was no, in fact, it's essential that the decades of experience, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1721.74s)]
*  however successful or not, and I think there is a certain degree of humility on the part of the U.S. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1732.62s)]
*  that's demanded if we look at certainly Afghanistan and even Iraq but yes indeed it is essential that [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1736.94s)]
*  stabilization efforts in places like Lebanon and Syria move forward with the best practices in mind [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1744.78s)]
*  issues around inclusive governance, issues around accountability, the rule of law, these are countries [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1753.3400000000001s)]
*  particularly Syria whose social fabric has been utterly torn apart and so the role of, you know, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1759.02s)]
*  transitional justice but also reconciliation, how to balance that, there's so much and in fact [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1765.66s)]
*  just to say one last point of the timing of this in terms of where the U.S. is couldn't be worse [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1771.3400000000001s)]
*  right with the dismantling of USAID having worked there myself for a few years and [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1776.3000000000002s)]
*  frankly even before that with the dramatic decline in U.S. foreign assistance dollars [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1782.6200000000001s)]
*  this is exactly the moment for that level of expertise to be called upon to help guide these [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1787.98s)]
*  very important and I would say, you know, I'm optimistic that these processes can land well [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1796.94s)]
*  but the challenges are enormous so I think that the challenge ahead is to think about how in fact [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1803.8200000000002s)]
*  to sort of catalyze and consolidate that expertise just because USAID has been dismantled does not [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1809.82s)]
*  mean that expertise is gone on the contrary, you know, there are scores of incredibly seasoned [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1817.02s)]
*  professionals who have a lot to bring to the table so we have to start thinking about a new model [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1826.46s)]
*  what's the new model for how to engage on issues around stabilization and how to engage in [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1831.26s)]
*  issues around stabilization in particular and how to sort of how to plug in this expertise where it [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1838.14s)]
*  exists in a new and different way. Kareem and then Omar. I love this debate. This is so fabulous. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1845.5s)]
*  I think a couple points of debate which is, you know, Jeff Bezos has said that his leadership [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1851.9s)]
*  philosophy at Amazon as CEO he says I'm inflexible on vision but flexible on details [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1859.8999999999999s)]
*  that essentially describes Ayatollah Khan and his leadership philosophy as well. He's shown [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1869.4199999999998s)]
*  himself to be inflexible on vision. The vision death to America, death to Israel, you know, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1874.78s)]
*  kicking America, trying to defeat the US-led world order. The details you do normalization with Egypt [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1881.82s)]
*  or Jordan. Those in my view are not principles but they're details and he's willing to be [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1888.94s)]
*  compromised on them but you're right Mona that in the Gulf there's been a detente between Iran [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1894.8600000000001s)]
*  and the Gulf countries but several ways to make predictions about the Middle East. I would predict [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1902.22s)]
*  that Iran is going to do everything it can to sabotage Lebanon and Syria's ability to transition [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1907.66s)]
*  to a stable prosperous post-Iran order and you know I spent a year as a Fulbright scholar in [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1914.78s)]
*  Beirut many years ago. My big takeaway from that year is it takes decades to build something and [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1921.82s)]
*  it takes days and weeks to destroy it. They're very effective at sabotage and destroying things [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1927.1s)]
*  so whether it's carrying out a bunch of assassination campaigns of individuals trying to kill Ahmed al-Sharah. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1932.3s)]
*  If they see, which is I think they do see right now, a post-Iran order, Hezbollah disarming, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1939.3400000000001s)]
*  Syria being hostile to Iran, inimical to their interests, they're very effective at sabotaging [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1949.18s)]
*  and if you talk to Gulf countries leadership they won't tell you that their views and concerns about [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1954.3000000000002s)]
*  Iran have changed. They haven't changed but I think they realize that if you're MBS and you [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1961.58s)]
*  are going to take a decade to go and try to build Niamh and you pour a trillion dollars into it and [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1970.1399999999999s)]
*  Iran can come by in an afternoon and destroy it or sabotage it with rockets missiles and drones, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1975.26s)]
*  you want to deconflict. But if there's an attack on their nuclear facilities [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1981.6599999999999s)]
*  I think there's a decent likelihood that they're going to retaliate against in Saudi Arabia and [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1987.9s)]
*  elsewhere. So I think that the pessimism I just laid out I think will remain as long as this [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=1994.7s)]
*  supreme leader is in power, which is not going to be forever, he's 85 years old, but I've never seen [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2005.66s)]
*  signs that he's shown himself capable of change and reforming his worldview. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2010.86s)]
*  Thank you. Amr. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2019.02s)]
*  Thank you, Sarah. I believe there are two approaches to the current geostrategic environment [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2020.46s)]
*  in the region. One is more of sort of a macro approach where we would be expecting [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2026.22s)]
*  sort of a lasting stable agreement and settlements of all conflicts around, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2032.78s)]
*  where we would wake up to find a solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, find Iran behaving [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2043.34s)]
*  regionally in a sustained fashion in a fundamentally different way than what Iran has been doing in the [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2049.9s)]
*  last decades and finding zones of instability and military conflict and civil strife in Libya [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2055.26s)]
*  and Sudan and Yemen, figured out. I mean this is not going to happen. I believe what we need to [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2064.5400000000004s)]
*  focus on and look at and see what agents on the ground are doing is with regard to the baby steps [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2069.1000000000004s)]
*  you were referring to, Mona, or piecemeal temporary settlements that would put the region in a way [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2076.86s)]
*  better place than where we are right now and where we have been especially in the last two years. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2083.58s)]
*  So finding some rapprochement and detente in the Gulf is positive, not only from a Gulf security [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2088.7799999999997s)]
*  perspective, but for the peninsula in general, and it helped definitely in the last two years [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2095.9s)]
*  stabilize the situation in Yemen, which is still facing a very difficult humanitarian situation, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2101.58s)]
*  but at least the bloodshed we were seeing before the Chinese mediated agreement between the Saudis [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2108.22s)]
*  and the Iranians to restore diplomatic relations is no longer happening. When I look at developments [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2114.06s)]
*  in Lebanon, yes, baby steps, but encouraging. When I look at developments in Syria, and I believe [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2119.74s)]
*  Syria is a question which needs to be looked at domestically, not only regionally, and my doubts [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2125.98s)]
*  are about the capacity of the current government, those who are in charge to figure out a way of [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2131.82s)]
*  creating a momentum for national reconciliation, for inclusion, for representation. These are the [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2138.46s)]
*  challenges not only whether we have enough regional actors in support or regional actors like Iran [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2144.1400000000003s)]
*  trying to maybe undermine. When I look at the situation in Libya, and Fred of course knows [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2149.42s)]
*  the stalemate in Libya and its impacts, what does it take to figure out baby steps to move forward? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2156.86s)]
*  So these are two fundamentally different approaches. I believe if we take regional agency seriously, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2163.1s)]
*  we need to look at the details of what's happening, not put a broad brush on a picture, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2169.26s)]
*  which continues to be problematic. This is a region where we have per capita the most displaced, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2175.02s)]
*  the highest number of displaced people as of now, where we have been seeing ongoing [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2179.82s)]
*  bloodshed and military conflicts throughout the last years and instability since almost a decade [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2185.5800000000004s)]
*  and a half. So it and where long-standing crises with regard to the social fabric, with regard to [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2190.54s)]
*  the polity in each one of the countries, including the Gulf with the deep pockets, continue to persist. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2200.78s)]
*  However, the argument that could be put forward right now is in defense of baby steps that can be [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2209.1s)]
*  guaranteed by international actors. So exactly as Fred was mentioning, the US role or the European [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2215.98s)]
*  role is not to initiate, but to come in and help in stabilizing piecemeal agreements that are [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2223.18s)]
*  unfolding on the ground. How to do that, with what mechanism, with what kind of diplomatic framework, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2231.26s)]
*  what can we learn in the region from comparative experiences in Europe or elsewhere, what can we [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2235.98s)]
*  draw on to develop collective arrangements? Once again, Arab League Plus is the real challenge. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2241.82s)]
*  Thank you. I want to just remind everyone, if you have questions, please use the QR code, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2248.7s)]
*  or if you're online, use YouTube comments. We'll turn to those in just a minute. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2252.94s)]
*  I did want to bring in Russia and China. We talked a little bit about China, but I'd love to hear [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2257.18s)]
*  from all of you a bit more about how you see Russia and China fitting into this picture that [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2261.98s)]
*  we've been painting so far. Maybe Karim, I'll start with you. Sure. Russia and China are always [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2266.7s)]
*  lumped together as like a unitary actor, and I think they have totally divergent interests [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2272.62s)]
*  in the Middle East. China wants to see regional stability and the free flow of energy, free flow [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2278.3s)]
*  of oil from the region. I would argue Russia benefits from the opposite. They benefit from [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2284.22s)]
*  instability, high risk premiums of oil and gas. Even though they're commonly lumped together, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2290.06s)]
*  I think they have very different interests. I actually believe that America and China have [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2297.42s)]
*  more common interests in the Middle East than China and Russia do. Interesting. Yeah, Mona. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2302.62s)]
*  Yeah, I agree, and I guess I would maybe pull a little bit on the Russia thread for a moment. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2307.74s)]
*  I think Russia has, however they may like to try to frame it, taken a pretty significant hit [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2313.66s)]
*  with the fall of the Assad regime. This was a primary platform for Russia to project its power [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2320.94s)]
*  and influence. That said, they're incredibly pragmatic, and they continue to find ways to [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2327.2599999999998s)]
*  the extent possible operate with Shara to try to maintain some kind of military presence. Of course, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2337.5s)]
*  we've also seen that they have quite a presence in the Gulf, in the Emirates in particular. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2343.34s)]
*  I think what's interesting for me is to sort of step back and understand again, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2350.2200000000003s)]
*  we're in a multipolar world and the Middle East is not isolated or insulated from all of the other [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2354.3s)]
*  things happening in the world. What's fascinating is to really trace the impacts of the Russia's [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2361.5s)]
*  invasion of Ukraine and the ways in which the Russians I think took quite a hit that [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2367.26s)]
*  emanated into the Middle East. In particular, and I'd really be interested in Karim's thoughts on [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2373.6600000000003s)]
*  this, the dynamics between Russia and Iran. Again, in Syria we saw initially that Russia [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2377.9s)]
*  was the senior partner and Iran was sort of more kind of coming along. That power dynamic shifted. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2385.7400000000002s)]
*  I don't know what it means going forward for the Middle East, this deepening relationship [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2392.06s)]
*  between Russia and Iran, the provision of drones, drone technology, even the setting up of a drone [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2397.66s)]
*  factory. What should we understand about that going forward? And also, what's Russia's position [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2402.7s)]
*  on Iran perhaps gaining a nuclear capability? In the past, the Russians were with us to the JCPOA. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2410.94s)]
*  In this kind of more unstable, multipolar world, we're not seeing that. Where that's going to go, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2418.7s)]
*  I don't know. Let me have you respond actually to the points on Iran and then move on panel. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2426.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, before I forget, this is pertinent to what you were raising. A friend of mine [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2431.1s)]
*  spent a few hours with Ahmad al-Sharah a couple months ago. And he said that Sharah had just had [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2437.66s)]
*  a long chat with Putin before their meeting. And he said Putin basically said to him, listen, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2446.78s)]
*  all of your weapons for the last decades have come from us and the Americans are not going to sell [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2454.3s)]
*  you weapons. So it's in your interest to keep the Russian bases in Syria and keep your weapons [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2460.0600000000004s)]
*  system because we're the ones who are going to need to resupply you. It's not in your interest [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2465.98s)]
*  to sever this relationship. It reminded me of that old adage from Kissinger, the diplomacy is telling [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2470.94s)]
*  other people what their interests are. So the thing about Putin is that when you speak to [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2475.66s)]
*  leaders, especially in the Gulf, it's very surprising how they say Putin is their friend. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2483.66s)]
*  They're okay dealing with him. I suspect it's true about Sisi as well, Amr. So [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2492.8599999999997s)]
*  the Iranian support for, the drone support for Ukraine, I don't know if Russia will share with [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2499.42s)]
*  them, they will probably continue to share with them missile defense systems that can deter Israeli [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2510.86s)]
*  attacks and things like that. But offensive weaponry, which they use against Gulf countries, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2518.46s)]
*  which they use against Gulf countries, I'm skeptical of that. And then you touched on [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2525.98s)]
*  the big question, which is has Putin's disposition about Iran having a nuclear weapon changed? [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2531.0200000000004s)]
*  And I think he benefits from, in some ways, the status quo. Iran not having a weapon but [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2539.42s)]
*  continuing to be a source of tension, a thorn in the side of the United States, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2546.46s)]
*  you know, this tension which, you know, risks the brings the price of oil higher. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2551.02s)]
*  This is the sweet spot he likes. I don't think he wants this issue. He doesn't want Iran to get a [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2558.38s)]
*  bomb but nor does he want this issue to be totally resolved. Yes, I mean the research work which Fred [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2562.94s)]
*  and I and other colleagues in the program have been doing has actually been pushing for a paradigm [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2571.98s)]
*  shift, which is not to look at what the U.S. is doing or what China is doing or what Russia is [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2580.14s)]
*  doing but to actually look at what regional actors perceive as being U.S. priorities, interests, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2585.9s)]
*  and policies or Russian priorities, interests, and policies and the same for China and to see how [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2592.54s)]
*  they interact with it. So if I am to stay true to this perspective with a focus on China, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2597.1s)]
*  I believe regional middle powers look at China as being A, able to do a grand offering similar [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2603.26s)]
*  to what the U.S. can offer. That's the one key difference between how they see China and how they [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2610.5400000000004s)]
*  see Russia. Russia is interesting from a military arms sale perspective from, not from a military [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2615.42s)]
*  deployment but from an arms sale perspective primarily. China is interesting from an arms [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2621.98s)]
*  sale perspective. China is building a base in the Horn of Africa. China is present in different [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2626.7s)]
*  ways, trade, technology, FDIs. So the one great power that can do a comparable grand offering to [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2634.54s)]
*  what the U.S. has been providing the region is China. That's one. Secondly, do middle powers in [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2641.3399999999997s)]
*  the region, and I'm not including Iran, I'm now focused on the Arab middle powers in the Gulf or [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2647.74s)]
*  Egypt or even I would stretch the argument to Algeria. If they have a choice between a grand [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2654.14s)]
*  offering coming from the U.S. and a grand offering coming to the same conditions from China, which one [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2661.42s)]
*  would they pick? I would say that they would still pick the grand offering coming from the U.S. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2665.98s)]
*  for different purposes and reasons including the history, the accumulated history of security [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2670.8599999999997s)]
*  arrangements and diplomatic presence and the roles which the U.S. had played. The more the U.S. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2676.14s)]
*  retreats, the more attractive the China grand offer becomes. Last point, on China, I believe [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2682.62s)]
*  it's important to see behavior of great powers from a regional perspective in moments of crises [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2690.94s)]
*  and wars. In the last two years, the one great power which has been on the ground trying to [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2695.9s)]
*  diplomatically solve, trying to militarily initiate has been the U.S. China has been missing. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2704.46s)]
*  Even at the southern entry point of the Red Sea where China's trade with the world has been [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2709.82s)]
*  impacted in a fundamental fashion, China continued to free ride on the U.S. security road. So I [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2714.2200000000003s)]
*  believe it's important, Sarah, to shift the lens to take regional active source and see how they [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2723.1000000000004s)]
*  perceive and interact with great power policies. Thank you. Fred? Yeah, my colleagues really hit it. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2729.1800000000003s)]
*  So I don't know what much I have left to say. But yeah, again, I think the theme of our analysis [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2736.46s)]
*  has been don't over inflate the threat from these powers. And certainly they are on the scene [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2741.58s)]
*  in different ways. I wouldn't consider either one a peer competitor. I think Russia is more of a [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2747.5s)]
*  disruptor. They've been very pragmatic, opportunistic in places like Libya, Sudan, Syria. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2753.1s)]
*  On the arms sales scene, I do think their regional image took a real hit with the fall of Assad [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2759.3399999999997s)]
*  because states are looking at that saying the Russians aren't going to be in your corner, right? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2766.06s)]
*  And so I think China is very significant on the trading front. I think states in the region are [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2769.18s)]
*  pursuing what's called a hybridized approach to their security where they're going to the U.S. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2777.5s)]
*  for external security and the Chinese for internal security. And we've seen that with a lot of the [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2781.98s)]
*  technology for internal surveillance. Look, I mean, we've said that the U.S. has to accept [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2786.06s)]
*  the presence of these powers. The question is where are we going to draw the red lines? Where do we [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2793.9s)]
*  perceive that our vital interests are at stake in pushing back against some of their [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2799.9s)]
*  encroachment? But we've been in meetings at various agencies where these questions are still being [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2804.46s)]
*  worked out. And just to echo Amr's point and conclude, we have to accept that regional states [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2809.98s)]
*  have the agency here, right? It's not like their passive pawns aren't a chessboard, right? They're [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2814.94s)]
*  the ones often calling the shots, inviting this power in. I mean, the Saudi-Iran deal was sort of [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2819.7400000000002s)]
*  gifted, right, to China, right? And so this, I think we have to accept that. The last thing I'll [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2824.94s)]
*  talk about is the public opinion piece of it. It's fascinating and disconcerting that China is [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2829.66s)]
*  pulling ahead on the public opinion polls. And we have to say is that because of China's virtues [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2835.9s)]
*  on certain fronts, but also because of, you know, hostility, rightly so against U.S. policies in the [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2841.9s)]
*  region. Great. Thank you. I want to bring in some of the audience questions. And one of them is [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2847.6600000000003s)]
*  directed to you, Mona, but I invite everyone to answer it, which is that says, Mona, you spoke [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2853.58s)]
*  about the specialists that were laid off from USAID and states still being available. If they have no [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2857.6600000000003s)]
*  official capacity, how could, should their expertise be well used and by whom? And I want to add on to [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2862.46s)]
*  that to sort of broaden it to just more broadly, what is the impact of the aid cuts and sort of [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2867.1s)]
*  what does this mean for the public opinion question that Fred was just talking about? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2872.7799999999997s)]
*  So I'll have you start, Mona, and then. Sure. I mean, to answer the last, your question first, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2876.38s)]
*  I mean, the impact I think is enormous in terms of the hit that U.S. soft power has taken in the [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2880.62s)]
*  region. The really critical and important role that USAID in particular has played across the [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2886.94s)]
*  Middle East and North Africa. It is often, you know, in a region that is plagued by and often [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2893.74s)]
*  the U.S. is presented in a bad light or seen in a bad light, there is USAID coming with humanitarian [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2899.8199999999997s)]
*  assistance and projects and so forth from the American people. And I really think you can't, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2904.9399999999996s)]
*  really, one shouldn't underestimate just how powerful that is. So to the question, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2911.74s)]
*  let's be clear. Just because the government affiliation goes away, the skill set remains [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2918.62s)]
*  and it's a critical skill set. And in my view, I think what needs to happen is there needs to be [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2925.8199999999997s)]
*  a better way to connect that skill set with the funding that is emanating from the Gulf. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2931.02s)]
*  What that looks like, not clear. I'll make a plug for the Middle East program at CSIS. This is [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2940.22s)]
*  something I hope that we'll be able to work on. We want to lift up and have a pillar devoted to [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2945.98s)]
*  stabilization efforts in Lebanon and Syria in particular. The Levant stabilization pillar. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2951.7400000000002s)]
*  And we want to sort of look exactly at these questions of, you know, there are multiple [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2957.82s)]
*  stakeholders out there and no one is fully owning any of this. So how do we, you know, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2962.86s)]
*  how do we bring together folks in a hub, in an initiative that at a minimum, at a minimum, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2967.98s)]
*  their sharing of best practices. But also you have, you know, Gulf countries looking for, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2973.74s)]
*  okay, well, what USAID projects have been defunded? What should we be picking up? I mean, there's, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2979.42s)]
*  again, I think this is a new way that we're going to all need to be working. It's just starting. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2985.02s)]
*  But I think we should not at all kid ourselves that just because somebody might lose their [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2989.98s)]
*  U.S. government affiliation, that depth of knowledge and experience carries with them. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=2995.74s)]
*  Thank you. Fred, did you want to comment on this? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3000.7s)]
*  Yeah, I would agree with Mona. I just think the cuts are going to be felt, you know, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3003.66s)]
*  years from now and we'll, I think we're going to regret them. And I want to circle back to [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3009.8199999999997s)]
*  one of Kareem's points about Iran's entry into the Arab world in fractured societies and the way it, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3014.54s)]
*  you know, creates militias or supports militias. I mean, one of the best ways the U.S. had of, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3020.8599999999997s)]
*  in my view, of countering that in terms of rebuilding security sectors was not through, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3025.42s)]
*  you know, traditional conventional military assistance, but through the sorts of skills [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3032.2200000000003s)]
*  that USAID had where you're talking about security sector reform and dealing with militias as a whole [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3036.94s)]
*  of government problem where you're talking about the economic, the social roots and these sorts. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3042.38s)]
*  I'm not saying we did it well all the time, but it was a tool and we had the knowledge base of [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3046.2200000000003s)]
*  people who understood how to operate in these fractured environments that a lot of times [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3051.82s)]
*  traditional diplomats didn't know. And so that is also a counter to, you know, Iran's influence. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3056.7000000000003s)]
*  Iran is very capable of operating in these fractured societies. And unfortunately, I think we're [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3062.06s)]
*  basically abdicating, we're pulling back in terms of the personnel cuts. You could argue also on the [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3066.78s)]
*  counter extremism front, right? I mean, we're, who knows what's going to happen now that there [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3073.1800000000003s)]
*  isn't USAID aid going into certain camps and we'll see the effects years from now. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3077.66s)]
*  Omar, did you want to come in on this? Well, maybe only to say that it's been disheartening [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3084.54s)]
*  in the last weeks to attend meetings and to see many attendees with signs having their names on [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3092.7s)]
*  former USAID and then to listen to their expertise manifested in their comments on different issues. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3099.3399999999997s)]
*  We had an excellent private discussion here at Carnegie on Sudan and we benefited a lot from [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3106.7s)]
*  the expertise of former, meanwhile, former USAID experts. So it's disheartening and I hope it gets [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3114.62s)]
*  addressed. I'm not sure how, but I hope it gets addressed. Kareem? Well, I think one of the greatest [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3124.46s)]
*  investments America's ever made in the Middle East has been American University of Beirut, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3130.3799999999997s)]
*  probably American University of Cairo as well. The return we've gotten on that has been phenomenal [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3134.38s)]
*  and I think that, you know, that institution is facing major challenges as a result of these cuts. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3138.86s)]
*  I would add to USAID Voice of America. Voice of America was very impactful in Iran. It had the [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3144.06s)]
*  ability to reach 40 million Iranians who are either reliant on state television or BBC Persia [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3150.86s)]
*  or Iran International. It had issues, it had challenges that needed to be reformed, but [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3159.02s)]
*  the regime felt very strongly about that and so for Trump to just unilaterally shut it down, [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3164.46s)]
*  at least get some concessions in return if you're going to shut that down. So I think Fred is right [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3170.2200000000003s)]
*  that the impact of these things will be way than yours. Another audience question, in terms of a [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3176.3s)]
*  regionalized security arrangement or agreement, what role do you see for the GCC or the Arab League? [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3183.82s)]
*  Should a new arrangement build on these existing entities or be completely separate? [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3189.26s)]
*  Maybe I'm going to ask you to start. Sure, thank you, Sarah. Let me now [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3194.46s)]
*  refer to the excellent research work which our junior fellow Natalie Trish has been doing in the [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3202.86s)]
*  last month on examining how effective or how less effective or how ineffective collective arrangements [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3209.5s)]
*  emanating out of the Arab League have been in general. And the track record has been since the [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3220.22s)]
*  creation of the Arab League that collective security arrangements that have been pushed [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3226.78s)]
*  forward within the Arab League have been in general ineffective. If they have been effective, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3233.42s)]
*  it's been for a short while and it didn't last, they have not lasted for a long time. The effective [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3239.1s)]
*  collective security arrangements we had in the region where regional agents inspired or initiated [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3247.3399999999997s)]
*  or mediated but backed by international guarantees from primarily the U.S. So if I take the track [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3256.2999999999997s)]
*  record seriously, Sarah, the response would be that regional actors, primarily states, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3264.3s)]
*  have to sit down and figure out ways of resolving conflict but not in a holistic approach. I believe [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3270.54s)]
*  this is not going to take us anywhere but by actually dismantling, breaking down the different [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3276.54s)]
*  zones of instability, of wars, of civil strife, of military confrontation and trying to get to some [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3282.78s)]
*  progress in some of them or at least in one of them in a regional context that is all inclusive. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3289.58s)]
*  This has to be, once again, Arab League Plus. It cannot continue to be by elimination of non-Arab [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3295.9s)]
*  actors in the Middle East, Iran, Turkey, and Israel. They have to be factored in. And secondly, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3304.22s)]
*  some workable agreements with regard to guarantees, with regard to some backup plans in case [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3309.74s)]
*  the respective arrangement falls apart, will have to be pushed forward and promoted by the U.S., [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3319.18s)]
*  maybe by the Europeans. If the U.S. and China can work maybe in the Gulf or with regard to Yemen or [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3327.5s)]
*  with regard to other places in the region, that would be great. But the track record is [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3333.58s)]
*  regional agents take the lead and they then need for their collective [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3339.8999999999996s)]
*  arrangements some international backing. Great, thank you. Do you want to comment, [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3345.5s)]
*  Kerry? Well, it's tangential to what Amr said and what Munez talked about, which is a topic we [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3351.1800000000003s)]
*  haven't really touched on today and you could do a whole other panel on it, but that is to what [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3357.42s)]
*  extent when we're thinking about our own aid or working with Gulf countries to offer aid, [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3363.0200000000004s)]
*  is it still going to be tied to conduct of these governments, whether it's human rights metrics, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3370.62s)]
*  democracy metrics? It seems like that certainly President Trump and his speech in Riyadh, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3378.14s)]
*  the biggest applause line he got was when he basically said nation builders who destroyed [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3384.7799999999997s)]
*  more nations than they built and regime changers who knew nothing about their societies. That is [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3391.58s)]
*  the ascendant view in the Republican Party and I think probably among many Democrats they would say, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3399.1000000000004s)]
*  well, we need a humble foreign policy. So that is for me a big question, whether it's Egypt or [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3404.54s)]
*  Syria, are we going to ask Ahmad al-Shada for certain metrics with regards to [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3414.38s)]
*  to treatment of women and religious minorities or some administration argue that that's necessary. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3421.18s)]
*  Others say no, we should just remove the sanctions in a blanket way, but I think that's one of the [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3429.1s)]
*  big challenges and debates we're going to be grappling with in the coming years. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3433.4199999999996s)]
*  Thank you. Munez, do you want to comment? I mean, just a quick word. One, I think on your points, [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3438.3799999999997s)]
*  Kareem, they're exactly right. I mean, the only other point I would add though is look [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3444.8599999999997s)]
*  across the region, Trump's rhetoric, I think was [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3449.7400000000002s)]
*  roundly applauded. This is a region that has long held up concerns about U.S. double standards and [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3454.94s)]
*  hypocrisy and frankly in the shadow of Gaza, efforts to nation build and preach democracy [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3463.02s)]
*  and human rights really are going to ring even more hollow. So I think there's a certain degree [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3475.34s)]
*  of humility that has to be engaged. I was really struck, Amr, by your comments and it made me think [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3480.1400000000003s)]
*  and this is not my area of expertise and you've done clearly quite a lot of work on this and [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3486.06s)]
*  it sounds very compelling and I think the questions really are what you pointed to, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3490.78s)]
*  how to bring in the non-Arab elements, Turkey, Israel, Iran, who will be critical, right, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3496.2200000000003s)]
*  to some sort of ultimate move toward a regional security architecture. The Middle East, not [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3503.82s)]
*  surprisingly, I think is the only region in the world that's lacked something significant like [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3509.82s)]
*  this and as you were speaking and you were talking about maybe smaller groupings, I think is sort of [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3514.3s)]
*  where you were tending or what came into my mind is the idea of mini laterals, you know, smaller [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3519.1000000000004s)]
*  groupings that can be used to address particular regions or sub regions where there are challenges [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3524.54s)]
*  and issues. With the understanding though that those mini laterals aren't weaponized [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3529.5s)]
*  to score points or undermine or sabotage those who aren't in the mini lateral because and so if [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3537.5s)]
*  they're really genuinely attempts to solve problems in a more defined and limited way, [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3543.18s)]
*  understanding the limits of what can be done, I think that might be a really interesting approach [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3549.02s)]
*  to start with. Fred? Yeah, I'd actually written down mini laterals but no, just to echo what was [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3553.1s)]
*  said, I do think the Arab League and the GCC, look, we've tried to make these institutions into [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3560.7799999999997s)]
*  something they're not and the problem has always been they're exclusionary, they're often [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3565.58s)]
*  perceived as vehicles for one state to protect, project influence, the GCC. The U.S. has been [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3571.18s)]
*  trying to deal with the GCC as a security collective but the individual members prefer to [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3576.06s)]
*  have their dealings directly with the U.S. so this is, you know, not worked out and I do think the [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3581.1s)]
*  the path forward is to, you know, use these platforms as the basis for expanding and then [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3586.7799999999997s)]
*  also breaking off into more manageable problems, working groups and things like freedom of [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3593.8199999999997s)]
*  navigation or climate change, things that all the parties can agree upon where we're looking [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3599.42s)]
*  incrementally at, you know, confidence building measures. I do think one example of [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3604.3s)]
*  both regionalizing and internationalizing security is the I2U2, you know, group which includes [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3610.86s)]
*  India, Israel, UAE and the United States, again, talking about things like food security, energy, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3618.0600000000004s)]
*  public health and so again, starting small and working up. Thank you. I think we have time for [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3623.1000000000004s)]
*  one more question so I'm going to throw this one out to you all sort of, you know, creative question [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3629.34s)]
*  which is we've seen an unprecedented number of black swans or unpredictable change triggers this [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3634.6200000000003s)]
*  past year such as the death of Nasrallah, Al-Sharif's win against Assad and the PKK seeking [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3640.1400000000003s)]
*  transition. What are you watching for next and what are these changes adding up to? So I know [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3644.78s)]
*  no one likes to make predictions but are there some black swans or situations that are on your [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3649.58s)]
*  mind or things that you think maybe not might not be quite as black swan-ish as they seem? [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3654.46s)]
*  You want to start? Yeah, so I think the reason why I actually did this exercise in researching [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3660.38s)]
*  a foreign affairs essay I wrote last fall, which region of the world has had the most black swans [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3666.78s)]
*  in the last half century and by far it's the Middle East. If you look at, you know, the Iranian [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3672.14s)]
*  Revolution, Saddam's invasion of Kuwait, 9-11, you know, the Arab uprisings, October 7th and [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3676.06s)]
*  one of the reasons that this region has more black swans than others is that there's a lot of [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3684.22s)]
*  what business people call key man risk, you know, big decisions or big events hinging on, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3690.62s)]
*  you know, one person, right? The Shah of Iran falls, he had terminal cancer, no one knew, [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3698.8599999999997s)]
*  and the entire region changed, right? And most other regions are not like that. So what are the [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3704.2999999999997s)]
*  black swans that I would worry about? I worry about Jordan more than any other place. I think [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3710.14s)]
*  that just the demographics of Jordan, you know, probably at this point around 80 percent of its [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3718.14s)]
*  inhabitants are not ethnic Jordanians, you know, virtually landlocked, very little resources. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3726.2999999999997s)]
*  That is the place that I worry about most stability in Jordan. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3733.2599999999998s)]
*  So is it still a black swan if there are lots of them? I don't know. But it's funny, Kareem, [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3740.14s)]
*  I literally wrote down Jordan because I thought, oh, I hate these questions, but Jordan is, I would [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3745.8999999999996s)]
*  agree with you, a key country to be concerned with not only for the reasons you laid out but also for [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3750.62s)]
*  the instability in the West Bank and the ripple effects into Jordan and what all of that means. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3757.34s)]
*  And maybe could we talk about a white swan too? Like is there also something positive? And here, [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3763.5800000000004s)]
*  I think, could there be, against all odds, movement toward some sort of durable solution on Iran [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3769.1000000000004s)]
*  nuclear that actually opens the way for its, you know, integration into the region in a way that [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3778.46s)]
*  works for Israel and its security, et cetera? That would be a white swan. So let's put that on [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3783.82s)]
*  the board as well. I like that. Omar. The black swan I see is more military adventurers, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3788.86s)]
*  as we've been seeing in the last two and a half years almost. I'm extremely concerned about the [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3796.94s)]
*  impacts of more military adventurers coming out of Israel that has manifested itself not only in [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3805.58s)]
*  Gaza or in actions on the ground in the West Bank but in Syria, in Yemen, and elsewhere. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3815.98s)]
*  And that not only referring to the danger of a military operation against nuclear sites or some [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3823.34s)]
*  sites in Iran, the environment in the region gets extremely complicated by one actor resorting [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3832.86s)]
*  systematically in a sustained fashion to the military tool as the only way of resolving its [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3841.1800000000003s)]
*  conflicts. It de-incentivizes collective security arrangements. And to incentivize collective [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3846.6200000000003s)]
*  security arrangement, we need some restraints. And here too is an example for where international [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3853.26s)]
*  actors can play a role in de-incentivizing military adventurers. That's a black swan I see. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3858.54s)]
*  Great. Thank you, Fred, to you. Yeah, I think just to follow on that, [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3863.82s)]
*  the return to this sort of era of interventions and what could prompt that. I want to throw [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3867.74s)]
*  something a bit provocative, but the role of technology, AI. And we don't know the full [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3873.98s)]
*  impact of AI on states' calculations. We see them using it for internal security. But in terms of [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3877.82s)]
*  their war-making apparatus and what we saw with Israel's use of AI in Gaza and how that affects [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3882.62s)]
*  states' willingness to go to war if they perceive the costs are lower. And we saw the availability [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3889.02s)]
*  of drones, changed warfare in the region. Who would have thought the Turks would be going into [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3894.46s)]
*  Libya and what they're doing? So how technology can create, lower the risks for states to embark [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3898.62s)]
*  on adventures. And just to reiterate the issue of internal disruptions, internal change, Jordan. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3904.62s)]
*  We do have to recognize that the drivers of the Arab Spring are still there in many of these [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3913.1s)]
*  states. And so we shouldn't simply look at this region in terms of capitals and regimes. We have [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3916.78s)]
*  to look at what's going on below the surface. Thank you so much. Please join me in thanking [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3921.6600000000003s)]
*  all of our fabulous panelists for this session. So unfortunately, Representative Joe Wilson was [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3927.02s)]
*  supposed to join us, but is not going to be able to. He can't leave the House floor due to an [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3934.86s)]
*  ongoing vote. So we really apologize. We hope to have him back at Carnegie in the coming days. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3938.78s)]
*  But in the meantime, we do have some snacks in the lobby. I promise it is less hot out there. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3944.14s)]
*  Please join us out there to mingle with your fellow attendees and enjoy some snacks. Thank [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3948.7799999999997s)]
*  you so much again. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thanks, Sarah. Thank you all. Thank you for including [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXSDFnT5_c&t=3953.3399999999997s)]
