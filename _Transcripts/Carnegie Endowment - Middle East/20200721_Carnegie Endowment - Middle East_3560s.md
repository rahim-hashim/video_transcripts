Video Description: On June 27, Tunisia opened its land, sea, and air borders for the first time in three months. While the government’s aggressive response to the coronavirus successfully limited the number of cases in Tunisia, the shutdown caused economic stress, with forecasters now projecting a 7 percent drop in GDP this year.

# Tunisia’s Accelerating Economic Challenges
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [July 21, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU)
*  Hello, everyone, and welcome to our event on Tunisia's economic challenges. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=0.0s)]
*  While Tunisia has managed to weather the COVID-19 pandemic relatively well, the economy has [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=10.0s)]
*  suffered dramatically. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=15.0s)]
*  The pandemic will likely push unemployment up to above 20 percent, while the economy [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=16.84s)]
*  is expected to contract by nearly 7 percent this year. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=21.46s)]
*  At the same time, Prime Minister Ferfer recently resigned, and President Said is expected [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=25.16s)]
*  to announce a new candidate for the prime minister on Saturday. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=29.82s)]
*  Here to discuss how Tunisia can address these and other economic challenges are three fabulous [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=33.66s)]
*  experts. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=38.42s)]
*  Mehdi Ben Abdallah is the founder and managing partner of Excalibur International Advisory, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=39.42s)]
*  president of the Tunisian-British Chamber of Commerce and a board member of the American [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=44.7s)]
*  Chamber of Commerce in Tunisia. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=47.84s)]
*  Ons Ben Abdulkareem is the country representative in Tunisia for Expectation State, and Ayman [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=49.7s)]
*  Reis is the strategic and investment advisor of the USAID-funded project Tunisia Jobs. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=56.1s)]
*  After a brief discussion with our panelists, we will turn to the audience for questions. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=61.34s)]
*  Please if you have questions, submit them in the YouTube chat, or you can privately [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=65.86s)]
*  submit questions to middleeastatceip.org. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=69.76s)]
*  Now panelists, let me start by asking each of you to tell us what you see as the biggest [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=75.42s)]
*  economic challenge in Tunisia facing us today. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=79.42s)]
*  I'm going to start with Mehdi. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=82.22s)]
*  Thank you, Sarah. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=85.58s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you, everyone. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=86.69999999999999s)]
*  Pleasure to be with you today. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=88.78s)]
*  And I hope next time we'll be all together, not only by video. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=90.66s)]
*  Let's hear Tunis. Thanks for your question. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=94.17999999999999s)]
*  Tunisia is like many, many countries around the world is facing a number of economic challenges, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=96.69999999999999s)]
*  but Tunisia is facing some specific to it, especially with a post-revolution environment [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=104.1s)]
*  because of Covid and so on. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=109.3s)]
*  Clearly, unemployment is the key one, especially unemployment for youth and for the young generation [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=110.86s)]
*  and the young graduate. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=118.7s)]
*  The second one I see is a public debt and public spending that is increasing tremendously [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=120.46s)]
*  and weakening the financial situation of the country. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=128.5s)]
*  Of course, that also comes from the decline of strategic sectors. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=133.22s)]
*  We cannot mention that without talking about the production of phosphate. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=137.82000000000002s)]
*  And Tunisia has just announced that we might be starting to import phosphate. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=143.18s)]
*  It's absolutely critical for Tunisia and the oil and gas production. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=148.86s)]
*  Of course, the other three or two, I would say, that are very important is the decline of tourism [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=153.98000000000002s)]
*  that was hit this past few years since the revolution, of course, by the revolution environment, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=160.3s)]
*  by the terrorism at a certain time. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=166.3s)]
*  We started picking up, but unfortunately, the Covid is hitting us again just before the big summer season. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=168.22s)]
*  Adding to that, I would say the two other sectors that were hit economically is two public services, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=179.02s)]
*  is the education sector and the health sector, who are, you know, with the fact that these two sectors have, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=184.98000000000002s)]
*  the quality of the service has deteriorated. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=193.78s)]
*  It's pushing the medium household to go to the private sector, both for health and for education, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=196.5s)]
*  which is weakening their purchasing power. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=203.70000000000002s)]
*  And that is an important economic impact in Tunisia. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=207.46s)]
*  But, you know, here we jump directly to the economic impact. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=210.54000000000002s)]
*  But really, especially you mentioned the change again in the head of government in Tunisia. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=214.42000000000002s)]
*  It's unfortunate to say that the real economic challenge in Tunisia is first, political. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=220.66000000000003s)]
*  It's political and it's social. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=226.98000000000002s)]
*  It's the political instability that is really, really difficult for Tunisia. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=229.42000000000002s)]
*  And maybe the lack of social partnership between the state or, say, the government and the union, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=234.66000000000003s)]
*  that is taking the country to an efficient state company that is increasing the spending of the country [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=242.9s)]
*  and the disturbance for the private sector that is so important for investment in country. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=250.57999999999998s)]
*  And that, of course, leads to a barrier for economic development and the lack of attraction of investment [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=257.46s)]
*  and more and very importantly for Tunisia, of foreign direct investment. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=266.82s)]
*  And that, of course, leads to part of our GDP, increasing of debt. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=270.98s)]
*  And back again, the circle with the key problem, what is increase of unemployment, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=275.94s)]
*  increase of unemployment with a young generation. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=282.26s)]
*  And what we see today with the COVID is what is also something that we need to address very seriously. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=285.46s)]
*  It's not only a problem of creating employment for the youth, but with the COVID, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=292.42s)]
*  like any other country, is a risk to see us losing existing jobs and existing employment. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=297.22s)]
*  And that is something that has to be addressed very quickly. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=304.5s)]
*  Thank you very much. You've laid out a lot of different challenges. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=311.06s)]
*  Ones, what do you see as the biggest challenge or challenges? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=315.38000000000005s)]
*  Thank you, Sarah. Thank you, first of all, for the opportunity to take part in this conversation [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=319.06s)]
*  at a very challenging time for the world, but specifically for Tunisia. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=324.5s)]
*  I think that Tunisia has a lot of other developing countries to be able to recover from the COVID-19 crisis. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=329.46s)]
*  There is an absolute need for attracting more capital. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=338.26s)]
*  And I want specifically to talk about the issue of the economic development of Tunisia. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=341.06s)]
*  And I want specifically to talk about the issue of FDI and the FDI flow that is a way to attract more capital [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=346.58s)]
*  in a very, very specific time and challenging time for the country. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=354.58s)]
*  And this, of course, to be able to ensure growth and create more employment opportunities [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=359.94s)]
*  that are very much needed, as mentioned by Mahdi, specifically in a situation where social crisis [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=364.58s)]
*  can be very close and be very alarming for the country. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=372.1s)]
*  When we are talking about FDI flows, I think it's important to, from that perspective, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=375.62s)]
*  to be able to emphasize the importance not only to attract more FDIs, but also to be able to retain more FDIs. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=381.7s)]
*  And here we can talk specifically about three key challenges that Tunisia is specifically facing in this situation. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=388.98s)]
*  The first one is that Tunisia has been struggling with attracting more FDI and retaining since years now. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=396.18s)]
*  And due to the economic instability, due also to security problems, etc. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=402.98s)]
*  But here there is an added element, which is that today the crisis is global. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=408.18s)]
*  We are talking about an estimation of a decrease in global FDI of 30 to 40 percent in 2021 at a global level. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=413.78000000000003s)]
*  So necessarily this is going to have an impact on the situation in a country where FDI is structural to the economy like Tunisia. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=422.82s)]
*  Facing this global crisis cannot be treated with business as usual. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=432.9s)]
*  You cannot continue the same mindset with the same way of doing reform or approaching reform. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=440.09999999999997s)]
*  Because what used to be, let's say, important and critical is today vital for the survival of the country. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=445.94s)]
*  So and this takes us to the second challenge that today Tunisia cannot say I want to go back to normal. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=453.38s)]
*  Because there is a new normal which is not necessarily linked to the internal factors, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=460.66s)]
*  but is very much needed by the external dynamics out there at the global level due to the pandemic. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=465.70000000000005s)]
*  And being in a country with very strong barriers to investment that the government has been working on, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=472.5s)]
*  but today are very problematic related to problems of governance, problem of limits to reform, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=481.3s)]
*  related to vested interests, the problems also of the lack of competitiveness, the lack of again, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=488.66s)]
*  the lack of openness of the market, the challenges that an investor is facing in normal context today [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=496.74s)]
*  are even more problematic and push really pushes the situation to be a critical one. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=504.90000000000003s)]
*  Especially again in a context where competition is very hard, when you have opportunities out of the crisis, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=511.38s)]
*  but you have everyone competing for the same opportunities. So if you don't move forward, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=519.38s)]
*  you are not staying in the same place, you are moving backwards. And this is also a key challenge [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=524.82s)]
*  that we need to be able to take into consideration within the country. The last maybe element that I [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=529.14s)]
*  want to highlight is being in a situation of crisis again linked to investment, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=534.58s)]
*  and does not offer us as a country the opportunity to ask the question of the [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=540.6600000000001s)]
*  notion of quality of investment, the notion also of the sustainability of the type of the investment [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=546.0200000000001s)]
*  that we want to attract. And this really takes the debate from what really we mean by growth, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=551.62s)]
*  to find it ourselves in a very in a situation where we take whatever we find without really [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=560.5s)]
*  thinking in a very strategic matter. And I will link this necessarily if we talk about strategy [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=566.58s)]
*  and vision, I will link that necessarily to the aspect of instability, because in the end, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=572.1s)]
*  the most essential challenge that we are facing, because this is supposed to be something that we [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=577.94s)]
*  are in control of, which is the internal situation and the political situation. And this is [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=582.82s)]
*  unfortunately, one of the key weaknesses of us as a country today, is to find ourselves in [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=589.94s)]
*  a very turbulent situation, which does not allow us to make a vision to take even to make [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=597.86s)]
*  opportunities from the crisis that we are witnessing today. Thank you so much. That was very, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=605.3000000000001s)]
*  very interesting. And to you, Ayman, what do you see as the biggest challenges facing Tunisia today? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=611.5400000000001s)]
*  Well, Tunisia, as was mentioned by my own says, well, is part of a global supply chain, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=617.14s)]
*  and the supply chain was distorted globally. So you have industry basically, who are focused on [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=625.3s)]
*  part of the supply chain, they don't have any more the supplier of the raw material, they don't have [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=632.26s)]
*  their client on. They are basically dependent of the exchange between countries that they can use. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=637.06s)]
*  Just give you some numbers. In Tunisia, about 75% of the companies actually was hit by the crisis, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=643.78s)]
*  80% of them having distortion of their supply chain, and 67% of them having financial difficulties, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=650.3399999999999s)]
*  with 44% of the export orders being cancelled. And we saw this directly in the international market. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=657.6999999999999s)]
*  You know, the emerging market spreads have reached a historical level that makes almost impossible [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=666.74s)]
*  for Tunisia to issue euro bonds on the international markets. I mean, if you think about it, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=672.1s)]
*  the Tunisian euro bond that was issued a year ago maturing in 2025 at 575, is now trading at the [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=676.9s)]
*  yield of 12.5%. This yield was 6.6%. This is an increase of almost 7%, meaning 700 basis points. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=684.26s)]
*  Meaning 700 basis points. With public finances, with a huge gap of about 12 billion [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=695.06s)]
*  dinners, this gap is almost unmanageable. Now, this looks really, you know, ugly and bad, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=702.5799999999999s)]
*  but there are some also opportunities. I mean, the crisis showed that there is a radical shift to, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=713.14s)]
*  to, let's say, digital business. In a matter of days, people massively stepped up their use [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=720.3399999999999s)]
*  of technology. We're talking about e-education, e-banking, e-delivering, e-services. With that [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=726.74s)]
*  adoption remain post-crisis. Will we be back on the status quo? We don't know yet. I think the key [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=734.98s)]
*  thing for Tunisia is would we be using this, let's say, shift of paradigm as an opportunity [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=743.62s)]
*  where people see threats, we see opportunities. If we do that, that would work. If we stay with the [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=750.34s)]
*  old economy, it's not going to work. You know what we saw? People believe in what you believe, they [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=755.22s)]
*  don't believe in what you do. And this is bridged me directly to the political situation. If we have [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=760.34s)]
*  a government that basically say, okay, we can't work as before, this is an opportunity, let's move [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=767.14s)]
*  on, let's change the whole thing. Let's talk about the e-government. Let's help make, let's help [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=773.62s)]
*  business, make business basically and, and, and make money. Let's, I'll give you an example that [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=780.1s)]
*  actually can surprise you, Sarah. You know, everybody's talking about informal economy, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=786.8199999999999s)]
*  informal economy, and they're going to suffer, et cetera, et cetera. What helped Tunisian economy [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=791.14s)]
*  survive during COVID is informal economy. I was talking to some financial industries, whether [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=796.66s)]
*  our banks or leasing companies, the SMEs or the small, very small SMEs that they have one or two [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=801.9399999999999s)]
*  employees, they did survive, they paid their credit, they didn't have any issue. You know why? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=808.18s)]
*  Because if the guy who basically take a track on the leasing and he can't transport goods because [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=812.9s)]
*  it stopped everything, you know what he did? He just bought some vegetables, put them on the track [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=818.9s)]
*  and sell them on the street. It's informal, but that informality actually gave this adaptability. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=823.9399999999999s)]
*  So think about it. You don't have to be informal anymore because you know everything is free. You [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=830.02s)]
*  don't need authorization if you want to sell vegetables because all that you need is basically [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=834.66s)]
*  to show that you paid your taxes last year and that's it. So what I'm trying to say, and I want [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=838.5s)]
*  to take all the time because this is the first question is there are bad things, there are good [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=843.6999999999999s)]
*  opportunities here. I think Tunisian economy is small enough that they can adapt and it can change. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=849.0600000000001s)]
*  If you think about it, the whole budget that we need is the amount of money that General Motors [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=856.4200000000001s)]
*  got in 2008 from the government to change the whole country. That's all that we need. That's it. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=861.46s)]
*  Thank you. These have been really interesting. You guys have listed out a whole variety of [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=868.82s)]
*  issues and challenges and I want to drill down on some of them. But first, one thing that I don't [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=874.58s)]
*  think was really mentioned is the issue of regional marginalization. And sorry, actually before I say [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=878.82s)]
*  that, I just want to remind people that if you have questions to please submit them either in the [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=883.5400000000001s)]
*  YouTube chat or to middleeastatceip.org. But returning to regional marginalization, so [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=888.1800000000001s)]
*  one of the things that I think we've seen through COVID is that it's really highlighted the regional [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=896.4200000000001s)]
*  inequalities and that you've seen whether it's health care, education infrastructure, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=901.3s)]
*  that there's tremendous disparity between the interior and south regions and the coast. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=905.6999999999999s)]
*  This is something that was well known but this has kind of been highlighted through COVID. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=910.0999999999999s)]
*  And now we're seeing the return of the Kamor protests that are coming out to say the government [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=913.9399999999999s)]
*  never implemented the agreement it made in 2017. And I'm curious of what do you guys think, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=919.54s)]
*  how can Tunisia, whether it's the government, civil society, the private sector, or even the [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=925.62s)]
*  international community, how does this role of regional marginalization fit into the other [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=930.34s)]
*  challenges you've mentioned? And what can be done to actually address this? Or do you expect to just [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=935.38s)]
*  see this cycle of protests continue to occur over and over again? And would anyone like to start? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=939.7800000000001s)]
*  Whoever would like to can jump in. So let's have Ayman and then Mehdi. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=946.58s)]
*  Let me ask a different question actually. You talked about the regional protests. Why in the [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=954.1s)]
*  northwest, which is as poor as the south, they don't have these protests now? Why the Cape doesn't [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=960.02s)]
*  have protests? Why in Tabarca, which is a really poor area, they don't have a protest? You have to [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=964.98s)]
*  understand this is political protests that they are funded by people who don't want to have a [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=970.74s)]
*  government that is in place. These protests are, these are trucks who take people, they fund them, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=975.62s)]
*  they give them money, they give them food to go products. This is what we're talking about. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=983.14s)]
*  This is a very, very rich area where very many people make a lot of money and they have their [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=988.18s)]
*  best interest to not have a government in place because they are dealing with smuggling. They're [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=994.58s)]
*  dealing with financial crimes. I mean, financial crimes in the bottom, whether it's money [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=999.94s)]
*  laundering, whether, so there are two options for the government because the government has to be [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1005.14s)]
*  either strong there, I mean with stronger, which is not easy. There is a part of Tunisia that is [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1012.26s)]
*  not really controlled in the sense that we don't have the power to control the super south where [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1020.8199999999999s)]
*  there is so much money there, there's so much informal economy that is really tough to deal with. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1030.5s)]
*  Or the other way is like, okay, you know what, that part we're gonna let them [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1036.5s)]
*  basically help work as they want. We're gonna remove any restriction if they wanna do, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1041.46s)]
*  it's pretty much like a free zone called. And I think this is an overstatement that is made [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1048.18s)]
*  by the way by many donors, like there are some regional discrepancies. I'm gonna give you a [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1056.5s)]
*  number, actually I don't remember the number exactly, but if you take how much government spent [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1061.38s)]
*  by person in the south, it's way higher than many other people because it's not populated region. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1066.82s)]
*  And if you take Tatawin, for example, a lot of money was spent before and after the revolution. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1074.34s)]
*  So it's not like the government is putting that inside, is there are basically, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1081.1399999999999s)]
*  there are always some political turmoil coming from the south. And this is go back 2000 years [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1089.62s)]
*  ago, I was reading a book on Tunisia, was written by Sophie Bessis that Madi and also know. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1094.18s)]
*  It's as if they are talking about today, it's as if they're talking about, it's always the same [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1102.18s)]
*  story. They take people from the south, they prompt them stuff, they give them money to go to [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1107.7s)]
*  more and that's it. It's manipulated in the south, we know it, to make the government, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1112.98s)]
*  the central government weaker. Why? Because that's in their best interest. I'm not talking [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1122.18s)]
*  about the population, the population is a victim. It's some big players who basically are smugglers [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1127.78s)]
*  and there are a lot of money involved. And basically they're using that as an excuse [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1134.98s)]
*  to basically show and negotiate with the government in different levels. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1141.22s)]
*  Thank you. Masti. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1145.38s)]
*  Few things here, I can't tend to agree with Eamon on a certain manipulation in certain areas in the [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1152.5800000000002s)]
*  south, especially by the borders where there is a number of people who have an interest to maintain [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1161.7s)]
*  the cows there. So there is a certain manipulation. But also, if we compare to the north and south, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1168.9s)]
*  they don't have also the cash cow that you can have in the south, like the oil and gas companies [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1177.6200000000001s)]
*  or the phosphate that has been just provided. The whole city's certain areas where living [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1187.3000000000002s)]
*  around these companies and they got used to it. So when these companies could not fulfil [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1196.66s)]
*  their expectations, they were the first to be attacked and blocked, which maybe in the north [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1205.7s)]
*  they didn't have this advantage or disadvantage, depends how we want to see it. But also, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1213.7s)]
*  the issue that we have, I think we can look way back from now. What happened also years ago, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1223.22s)]
*  and that starts since the Ben Ali system, it's a disconnect between the education system [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1232.98s)]
*  and the employment system in Tunisia. What we've done, we believe that equity or equality was to [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1240.42s)]
*  create, if we create a marketing university in Tunisia, we have to create a marketing university [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1251.54s)]
*  in Gabes or in Gafsa. And we started spreading that like that without looking at what was the [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1258.18s)]
*  need of the market. And at the end, what happened is in rural areas, we found ourselves with [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1269.14s)]
*  3000 Bachelors degree in marketing in oil and gas areas, and that has created a big gap between [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1277.78s)]
*  the expectation of this young graduate and what the market was offering. I think if we want to [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1288.18s)]
*  help, that's my opinion of course, if you want to help develop the regions, we should not [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1298.5s)]
*  look at a comparison with the cities or with the coastline, we need to look at their specificity, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1306.26s)]
*  we need to look at their potential. I worked a lot in the oil and gas sector, and I've seen [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1313.3799999999999s)]
*  specific cases that were extremely sad. I've seen young graduates coming from families with a good [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1325.06s)]
*  piece of land, father was a farmer, and if we would have trained this person to become a better [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1333.14s)]
*  farmer than the father, and better with it, if we have like put together universities, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1342.0200000000002s)]
*  agriculture university in that area to help them do better of what they have, it would have been [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1347.8600000000001s)]
*  way better than training that the young man who's coming from a rural family to become [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1353.0600000000002s)]
*  a bachelor's degree in order not to repeat marketing again in commercial or anything in [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1360.9s)]
*  design in an area that he didn't want to leave, but where there were no jobs for his skills. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1367.8600000000001s)]
*  The problem also is that in taking these people to this university, you hire their expectation, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1375.46s)]
*  they don't want to work their land anymore because also what we've done is we destroyed them, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1381.46s)]
*  let's say them how we view smaller jobs, how we view being a farmer. It's not a small job, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1387.86s)]
*  it's not a low job, it's an excellent job. But in taking these people to this different curriculum, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1395.54s)]
*  we made them kind of look down on what was a job of their parents and make them bachelor's degree [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1402.58s)]
*  of skill that is not sellable on the market, but they could not find a job, they didn't want to [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1411.86s)]
*  go back to where they were. So, and I think, I know it's a bit everywhere here, but because [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1417.7s)]
*  something that I really lived there and it was very sad for me to see this young graduate taking [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1423.6200000000001s)]
*  small job that was way below their competencies in a big company just because they were trained [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1431.06s)]
*  to and taught that they needed to get an office job. And there it was not well paid, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1441.3s)]
*  it was not adapted to them, but because we didn't educate them to meet the need of the market. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1447.78s)]
*  This is why for me for the future, it's extremely important to have a way better coordination, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1453.94s)]
*  synergy built between the public sector and the private sector and between school universities [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1460.9s)]
*  and businesses. If we don't do that, we are going to keep creating [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1468.1s)]
*  unemployed people, unemployed youth, keep creating frustration and keep creating rewards. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1474.8999999999999s)]
*  Thank you. Yes, Anse. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1483.3s)]
*  Yeah, if I can add something to that as well, I think it's important to say that inequality and [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1484.98s)]
*  margin marginalization is a fact and is real. And of course, you'll always have manipulation [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1494.1s)]
*  and you'll always have different interests in terms of putting more emphasizes emphasizing the [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1503.1399999999999s)]
*  social movements, but we cannot deny that the roots are real and there. And I think it's also [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1514.5s)]
*  linked to a policy of the state for a very, very long time about, and we are not talking [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1523.46s)]
*  about equality, we are talking about opportunities and equal access to opportunities because [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1529.38s)]
*  when we are talking about basic services that the government and the state needs to be providing [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1534.5s)]
*  in terms of health, in terms of education, in terms of access to transport, to basic rights, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1539.6200000000001s)]
*  the access is not the same and this is the reality. And in a time where [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1547.78s)]
*  the revolution brought hopes of change, there were expectations in these regions that they [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1554.82s)]
*  were marginalized under the dictatorship even way before. And those expectations were not met [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1562.34s)]
*  because the how the state is approaching development is true, you know, the intervention [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1570.5s)]
*  of creating jobs and the government creates and the state creating jobs and creating public owned [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1578.9s)]
*  companies and really emphasizing this importance of the need to be employed in a state-owned company [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1584.66s)]
*  to ensure security and sustainability of employment when what was needed is for the [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1594.1s)]
*  state to identify what is its role to provide basic services, health, education, transport, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1601.06s)]
*  etc. and to open up those regions to really unleash the potential there. There are starting [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1607.9399999999998s)]
*  to have initiatives like the Startup Act, which the basic and the idea behind that is really [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1615.06s)]
*  to open it for if you are a young lady or gentleman from the south, if you are from [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1621.62s)]
*  Tatawin or Soos or whatever region you are, you have exactly the same opportunities, you have [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1630.26s)]
*  exactly the same chances and it really depends on your effort and on your willingness. It does not [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1635.78s)]
*  depend on where you were born or the context on which you are living. And I think today [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1642.8999999999999s)]
*  the post-COVID crisis showcased this marginalization, which is real, and I think that [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1648.58s)]
*  again for us to be able because we cannot talk about sustainable growth or even potential growth [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1655.54s)]
*  if we don't really treat the roots of this sense of division within the country, if we don't also [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1662.98s)]
*  take it seriously and take it and really treat the roots and I think this needs and real attention [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1669.78s)]
*  in terms of shifting the pattern of seeing this from a government perspective. Again, not treating [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1677.3s)]
*  it in terms of injecting money but trying to create growth and create more, let's say, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1683.78s)]
*  richness from those regions actually that has a lot of potential to offer to the country. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1691.7s)]
*  Thank you. Another issue that Mehdi mentioned originally was this idea of public debt and [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1698.58s)]
*  public spending, the problems there. And what I think we saw, Prime Minister Ferfer was [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1703.54s)]
*  sort of poised to actually implement some austerity measures and trying to address this a little bit [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1708.98s)]
*  now that he will be gone. I'm curious, what do you think, what do you expect, or what would you [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1713.94s)]
*  hope the next government would do or how can the next government actually address this issue? We've [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1718.8999999999999s)]
*  actually had a question come in to asking about the role of the UJTT, the union, and sort of how [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1724.98s)]
*  do you balance this real need to actually cut down public sector spending but also recognise [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1731.62s)]
*  the power of the UJTT and the importance of protecting workers? How do you see this? What [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1739.06s)]
*  can the next government actually do to try to address some of these challenges? And let's start [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1742.9799999999998s)]
*  with Mehdi. Sure, that's it. Thank you. I think there's many things. There's no one solution, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1748.1s)]
*  not the magical button here that can fix everything. But clearly, we cannot keep [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1756.1s)]
*  surviving with public companies being managed that way and being accumulating debts. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1763.06s)]
*  It's not acceptable today to have, let's say, I take one example, to have a Tunisian airline company [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1774.34s)]
*  having a rate of about 300 employees per plane, which is beyond anything we can see. I'm not [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1785.6200000000001s)]
*  talking about here about firing people, I'm talking about the fact that there is a serious need [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1794.5s)]
*  to restructure these companies and a serious need to improve a partnership, a public-private [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1801.6200000000001s)]
*  partnership to enhance efficiency of these companies and see the Tunisian government [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1811.3s)]
*  focusing more on fundamental public services and let it go a little bit on other public companies [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1822.34s)]
*  in order to allow a partnership, strategic partnership with the private sector to restructure [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1835.54s)]
*  and make them more competitive. Because at the end, it's not about losing jobs, it's about [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1841.22s)]
*  creating companies that are more efficient, companies that will create new jobs and that [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1848.9s)]
*  will create additional growth for the company and for the country. I think that's one of the issues [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1855.46s)]
*  that why we are not restructuring this company because we look at them in silo. We look at them [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1864.74s)]
*  company by company. If we touch this company, how many jobs will we lose? We should not look at them [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1870.74s)]
*  like that. We should look at them in a helicopter view. If we restructure this company and make them [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1876.02s)]
*  more efficient, how that can help the overall economy and how that can help improve the country [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1881.3000000000002s)]
*  efficiency and improve unemployment in this country. Thank you. I'm in or Onze, would [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1887.7s)]
*  either of you like to come in on this? Sorry, let's start with Onze then. Go ahead, Onze. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1894.98s)]
*  Yeah, quick comment on that. I think this debate is going to be paused again because we have a lot [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1903.6200000000001s)]
*  of free forms that need to happen. Today, we are talking about public owned state company. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1910.26s)]
*  The Minister, for example, the Minister of Industry mentioned that the industry is going to [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1915.3s)]
*  expect to drop by 30% in 2020. So we'll have strategic sectors that they are going to be [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1921.54s)]
*  highly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and especially companies and sectors that are going [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1928.9s)]
*  to be highly touched by this. So the issue, unfortunately, in this case, is still political [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1939.62s)]
*  because here we are talking about being able to have a vision to share in a very clear way without, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1947.3s)]
*  let's say, beyond and above the ambition and the intention, clearly what is the plan. Because [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1956.02s)]
*  unfortunately, until today, we are talking about the challenge in debt, the challenge in state [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1962.6599999999999s)]
*  owned company, the challenge in this sector, the challenge in transport, in the industry, etc. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1967.7s)]
*  But no one was able until now, at least at the level of the political landscape, to propose a [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1972.42s)]
*  clear implementation plan based on which you can start negotiating with the unions, etc. And I [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1981.38s)]
*  think this is also the weak spot in all of that. And this goes back to the fact that being in a [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1988.26s)]
*  situation when you have more than 10 governments in less than 10 years, it's not a matter of having [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=1996.02s)]
*  10 or 20 governments. It's a matter of no one can really be able to develop a vision and have the [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2002.82s)]
*  time to implement it and deal with the consequences of it. So the consequences changes in the [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2010.1s)]
*  government put us in a situation where the problem is still there, the problem is growing, but the [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2018.34s)]
*  debate is still not at the right positioning and which leads to a situation where you cannot have [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2025.62s)]
*  a proper negotiation because you clearly don't know what you are going to do. Thank you. Ayman. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2032.8999999999999s)]
*  I agree with some of it, but I think the problem is much deeper in a sense that the political system [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2042.1s)]
*  that we have in Tunisia means that we can't have stability. It's by definition, you basically [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2048.98s)]
*  have laws passing. I mean, you have the head of parliament who might not, who might be basically [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2055.38s)]
*  removed or asked to resign because one guy, one of the parliament members might come late [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2063.78s)]
*  in the morning and he doesn't vote. I mean, sometimes it's one or two votes that change laws. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2071.46s)]
*  So what's happening is because of the political system that we have, it's so fragile [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2077.06s)]
*  that we have two options. Basically, either we're going to say, okay, we have to change it [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2083.8599999999997s)]
*  or we're going to say this is what we agreed on and then basically we should learn how to work [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2091.3799999999997s)]
*  without the government. Basically, let the politician do their politics and basically [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2097.2999999999997s)]
*  let the economy work by itself. We basically have a system like, for example, Belgium. They work [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2103.3799999999997s)]
*  without the government for two years. I mean, it's pretty much what it is. You're talking about, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2110.82s)]
*  for example, the next government. People talking about the next government, next government, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2115.6200000000003s)]
*  because everybody knows that the next government is going to have the toughest quarter ever, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2120.7400000000002s)]
*  where basically they need to negotiate the restructuring of debt, something we never had done [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2125.86s)]
*  since 56, since independence. They know they gave him a time bomb in his hands and basically is [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2130.7400000000002s)]
*  going to explode. So they're looking for who they're going to sacrifice. So you sacrifice [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2137.06s)]
*  the next government. So they're going to put everybody who want them to sacrifice, so they [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2142.1s)]
*  can build for the next one, which is in 2021. This is the situation where people are thinking. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2146.1s)]
*  So with that political situation, basically the only issue is, okay, let's remove authorization. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2152.02s)]
*  Let's remove more regulation. Let the people work by themselves. If you need to help people, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2160.66s)]
*  basically let them be entrepreneurs, let them do their business by themselves [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2169.7799999999997s)]
*  and remove the bureaucracy and remove anything that is basically not letting them work [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2178.2599999999998s)]
*  independently. People are fed up of government. People are fed up of parliament. I mean, you have [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2186.42s)]
*  to see the parliament scene these days. It looks like, I don't know, Broadway show. Actually, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2191.38s)]
*  Broadway show is not even enough. I mean, this is just insane. I mean, I advise everybody who's [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2196.7400000000002s)]
*  basically watching. This is completely insane. This is a luxury you cannot have in Tunisia because [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2202.1800000000003s)]
*  we reach a level where basically we don't have any more savings. This is a luxury that can be [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2208.1800000000003s)]
*  supported by Belgium maybe, but not Tunisia. So at some point, the next government is going to [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2213.7s)]
*  explode. I mean, at best it's going to last for six months, let's say. And then let's talk about the [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2219.14s)]
*  next government, which is then after this one, after the next one, what I mean. Would they have [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2225.54s)]
*  the courage to say, okay, now we hit bottom, let's do something about this. Let's do major reform. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2232.02s)]
*  And by major reform, it has to be major, basically like a Schumpeter way of thinking. Maybe this is [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2239.46s)]
*  the opportunity to change the business model. I mean, I always take the example of Mauritius [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2247.38s)]
*  Island in the late 70s, beginning of 80s. 50% of the GDP is coming from sugarcane. Sugarcane dropped [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2251.86s)]
*  by 50% in the beginning of 80s. They didn't have other choices. And they didn't have the best [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2258.58s)]
*  political system, by the way. I mean, I don't want to get into that. They decided to make Mauritius [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2263.62s)]
*  Island a hub for financial industries and a hub for tourism. And have been gone many times to [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2270.1s)]
*  Mauritius Island. And I can tell you the beaches in Tunisia are way better. I mean, it's a matter [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2276.98s)]
*  of will. I mean, you can make Tunisia as a financial hub, as a service hub with the healthcare [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2281.54s)]
*  education, as Mehdi mentioned before. It could be a hub for tourism. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2288.9s)]
*  Change the business model. We can't afford, as Onz and Mehdi said, subsidized Tunisia. This is [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2297.38s)]
*  not possible. This is the money is not going to education. This money is not going to healthcare. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2303.78s)]
*  You have to stop the dance. And to have that courage, you need to have a strong political [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2308.6600000000003s)]
*  backing, which you will not be able to have with this political system. Fair enough. I'm not asking [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2315.3799999999997s)]
*  that we need to change that. But at least we learn how to work with that political system. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2320.5s)]
*  That's what Darwin said. This survival species, the species that survive, they're not the [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2327.22s)]
*  strongest or the smartest one. Or the one who can adapt to their environment. So that's the only way [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2332.18s)]
*  to basically get out of the situation. I mean, that's my point. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2341.78s)]
*  Thank you. Mehdi, did you want to come in? [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2352.1800000000003s)]
*  Just a quick one. I agree with many things you said, Eamon. Just where I disagree slightly [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2354.42s)]
*  is in saying we can work without a government. Maybe let's leave the government on the side [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2365.6200000000003s)]
*  and just before it was, the black market helped us go through the COVID situation and so on. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2371.54s)]
*  It's a circumstance and it should be just on. We should not get used to that. We should not [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2380.18s)]
*  get used to that. And as much as I'm with you, we need to fully push so that we reduce bureaucracy, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2389.22s)]
*  that we enhance digitalization, so that the work with the government and the public sector is [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2400.42s)]
*  smoother, that we need to restructure our public companies and so on. I'm still also very keen on [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2407.06s)]
*  us giving all together a great focus on the political system. And I think the private sector, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2416.58s)]
*  the economists like you, the people who are working with investors like us, needs to keep [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2423.54s)]
*  pushing to help this political system progress. Because at the end, all of us here, we are [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2430.1s)]
*  criticizing a lot because we love this country. As you said, our beaches are better than the one in, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2437.7s)]
*  I don't know what you compare it to, with the Union or whatever. More issues. And I definitely [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2442.5s)]
*  agree with you. We love that country. That's why we allow ourselves to criticize it. But at the end, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2448.02s)]
*  we had our revolution 10 years ago. And in a time, in a historical time frame, it's still [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2453.06s)]
*  not a lot. There's a lot of things that we gain. We gain democracy. We gain freedom. We saw an [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2459.46s)]
*  unbelievable civil society being extremely active and helping, actually. We're talking about that. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2465.62s)]
*  The political system change, evolve, being the safeguard of it. We've seen, and I know you help [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2471.7s)]
*  a lot of young entrepreneurs. We see an unbelievable new crowd of young entrepreneurs. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2478.34s)]
*  A lot of creativity. These are the people that give me a lot of hope for the future. I think we [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2485.38s)]
*  have a real responsibility as a business sector also, not to drop the ball and say, okay, fine, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2491.3s)]
*  this is how it is. We will live with it. We will act as there is no government, as Black [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2501.06s)]
*  Market can work. And we need to keep lobbying. I'm sorry, the word lobbying works very well in the [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2508.42s)]
*  U.S., but less in Tunisia, but fine. I'm using it to keep lobbying, keep helping to push, maybe not [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2514.1s)]
*  change the full political system. And just before you talked about the political system, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2521.46s)]
*  there's difference or so between the political system and the electoral law that is the one [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2527.7s)]
*  that is actually creating a lot of disturbance in the spectrum of political parties that we have [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2532.8199999999997s)]
*  in the parliament. And there is few things like that. The electorate law is way easier to change [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2539.54s)]
*  than the political system. And if we all push toward one sense in saying that, no, actually, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2544.98s)]
*  in order to have the economy where we work, us as a private sector, as economists, we need to [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2551.54s)]
*  have certain stability. We can push towards small things like the electoral law and push for that [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2556.5s)]
*  in order to help create better stability for the government and for the state. Because at the end, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2562.1s)]
*  yes, we need more freedom economically. We need to have a better playground and a more free [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2568.82s)]
*  playground, but we need to have a strong state and a strong partner to work with. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2576.5s)]
*  Thank you. We've had several questions come in and we have about 15 minutes left. So I want to try to get [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2581.46s)]
*  to some of these two questions that are related, which is what is Tunisia's niche? In what sectors [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2587.7s)]
*  can Tunisia add jobs and expand production? And similarly, while it's important to discuss the [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2594.5s)]
*  economic challenges, what are the most important opportunities? Can we identify any emerging sectors [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2600.7400000000002s)]
*  for the near future? And so I'd like to hear from you guys on what are the... You guys have talked a [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2606.34s)]
*  little bit about some of them, and Iman, you were starting to mention some areas, tourism, for [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2611.06s)]
*  example, but what do you see as the most likely areas for expansion? And as we go into this new [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2615.06s)]
*  normal of the post-COVID or COVID world, what are Tunisia's opportunities? And maybe, Onze, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2622.42s)]
*  I'll turn to you first and then Mef. Sure. So obviously, you can see in terms of opportunities, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2628.02s)]
*  clearly you have sectors like ICT is one of the major sectors that presents a lot of opportunity. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2638.82s)]
*  And I think that the fact that, taking the example of Tunisia, the fact that you'll have [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2646.9s)]
*  private sector that really were mobilized during the crisis to propose solutions, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2652.74s)]
*  to innovate in a very quick and responsive way, really shows the quality and the added value of [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2657.94s)]
*  such a sector in Tunisia. And this has been always been one of the top priority sectors for [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2664.02s)]
*  investment in the country. And I think it does continue to be one of the most promising sectors [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2669.7s)]
*  to progress with. The second one, I think, everything related to pharmaceuticals, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2675.46s)]
*  is one of also the sectors where Tunisia has very strong assets since the past. And now with all [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2682.34s)]
*  what's happening in terms of the pandemic, Tunisia has also great assets to play with. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2689.86s)]
*  The third element, I think, the sector that can be interesting to look at is in terms of agribusiness. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2698.6600000000003s)]
*  I think it's also linked to the fact that we are seeing new trends in terms of consumption, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2705.86s)]
*  in terms of the culture also, in terms of what consumers are looking for and the trends towards [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2712.82s)]
*  sustainability as well. And sector like agribusiness and agriculture in a country like Tunisia can be [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2720.1800000000003s)]
*  one that is very promising and worth investing in and prioritizing in terms of the government [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2728.26s)]
*  strategy, in terms of investment. And I think, again, I cannot stop emphasizing this to present [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2736.5s)]
*  great opportunity for the country. The crisis has, of course, negative ramifications, but it [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2743.2200000000003s)]
*  should present an opportunity for growth, an opportunity to change the approach of how we do [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2749.94s)]
*  investments and what do we want to present ourselves as a country? What do we want to be [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2754.02s)]
*  able to promote? What is the branding? I think Tunisia did a really great job handling the [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2758.2599999999998s)]
*  pandemic and being able to sell this experience and showcase that Tunisia was really strong [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2763.7s)]
*  dealing with such crisis and presented in a very positive way can lead to opening new [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2770.98s)]
*  areas of investment in the country. Thank you. Mahdi and then Aiman. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2777.94s)]
*  Thank you. I think I want to go back to what Hans mentioned, I fully agree with you on [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2784.9s)]
*  new technology, pharmaceutical. You talked about agribusiness, definitely. It's a huge [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2790.98s)]
*  sector with a great potential and Tunisia is only in the beginning of its capabilities of export. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2797.86s)]
*  Adapting in new market. I mentioned the health sector, the tourism sector that can need to be [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2807.78s)]
*  reformed. Education is very, very, very important in Tunisia and we wear a hub, an African hub, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2814.42s)]
*  for a long time that we are losing, that it can be reenergized today with a strong partner from [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2821.46s)]
*  the US, from France, from the UK. But maybe I'd like to stop quickly on the energy sector. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2826.5s)]
*  Of course, there's a great potential in the oil and gas sector, in the Gulf of Gabes, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2832.82s)]
*  in the south of Tunisia and so on. But especially I'd like to emphasize renewable [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2840.26s)]
*  and energy efficiency. The potential of Tunisia is absolutely huge there, both in developing our [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2845.2200000000003s)]
*  energy dependency, but also in creating on a long term capabilities for export. There is a [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2855.54s)]
*  long term project in Tunisia, like the Elmed project, like the Tunur project, who have [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2867.22s)]
*  a potential to make Tunisia an exporter of renewable electricity to Europe. And I think [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2872.82s)]
*  this is an area that we should look at very strongly. We have, as Eamon said, we have the [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2885.38s)]
*  best sea, but we have also the best sun. And seriously, what we call the rate of sunshine [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2892.5800000000004s)]
*  in certain areas of Tunisia is beyond all the standards that you can see around the world. And [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2903.1400000000003s)]
*  there is absolutely great potential for that. And your question brings me to the question of [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2910.5s)]
*  your auditor, I think, bringing me to something that is fundamental for Tunisia. I think the [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2917.38s)]
*  fact that people ask what are the potential of Tunisia is because we are not marketing this [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2921.94s)]
*  country well enough. And one of the first tools that needs to be put in place is a true marketing [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2927.94s)]
*  strategy of Tunisia and an aggressive economic diplomacy with the right synergy between the [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2938.1s)]
*  public and the private sector. This is something that we haven't put in place yet. We're still [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2946.98s)]
*  selling Tunisia with the old fashion tools, two hours from Paris, we are the center of [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2951.94s)]
*  Mediterranean. I mean, all that we've known, we know it and I used it for the past 20 years. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2959.1400000000003s)]
*  This is a change. Tunisia today is an incredible youth generation, incredible young entrepreneurs, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2964.26s)]
*  is an incredible development in renewable energy. In IT, we need to look at how to improve [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2971.78s)]
*  carbon print for the companies that come here. This is an important one, carbon capture. We need [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2979.94s)]
*  to become one of the green economy hub for our partners, European, American, and others. And I [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2985.38s)]
*  think that is one of the potential that we need to promote and should be part of our economic diplomacy. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=2994.7400000000002s)]
*  Thank you. Ayman, did you want to come in on this? [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3001.7000000000003s)]
*  I just want to say that basically, we can't talk about opportunity without talking about resilience. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3004.5s)]
*  I mean, COVID basically showed us that you might have the best. I mean, you take the sector like [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3012.5s)]
*  Aeronautics, for example, which is a huge sector in Tunisia, where we have a huge hub and we have [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3017.62s)]
*  position in the right part of the value chain. But because of the whole global value chain is touched, [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3023.94s)]
*  these sectors didn't show resilience as we hope. But I would like to say there are basically, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3030.9s)]
*  let's say two major categories, sectors with strong resilience that we basically need, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3036.7400000000002s)]
*  they show opportunities and sectors with potential opportunities. So this is the two [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3042.66s)]
*  axes that we need to look at, strong resilience, talking about agribusiness, any consumer goods, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3047.54s)]
*  pharmaceutical as Anz mentioned, medical devices, education, etc. And sectors with potential [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3055.14s)]
*  opportunities, everything that is related to technology and innovation, e-commerce, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3062.1s)]
*  cybersecurity, biotechnology, renewable energy, as Mandy said, these are the two main categories [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3067.7s)]
*  that we need to basically look at in the near future. Thank you. Another question that came in [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3074.74s)]
*  is how bad is the bureaucracy in Tunisia? What needs to happen to make doing business easier? [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3082.58s)]
*  Who would like to start on that one? Or come in on that one? [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3089.94s)]
*  Messi, you're shaking your head. Go ahead. I think we need a session [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3095.14s)]
*  about that specific question. But I think I will give a brief comment on that and hand it over to [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3101.62s)]
*  Messi. I see that he's shaking his head and he wants to contribute to this question. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3111.2999999999997s)]
*  So I think bureaucracy is again the reality in the country. And I think it's one of the most, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3117.7s)]
*  let's say, problematic barriers to investment when we are talking about investment and promoting [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3126.02s)]
*  new investments in the country. The regulatory role of the state is way heavier. And I think this [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3132.74s)]
*  is something that the government has been working on. And I think it's important to highlight [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3142.5s)]
*  effort that has been done in that sense. The last year, the cross-cutting law that was adopted, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3148.1s)]
*  the investment cross-cutting law that was adopted, removed 20% of authorizations in the country. So [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3156.42s)]
*  that was, let's say, one of the most substantial reforms that were taking place in the country, [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3163.38s)]
*  because it touched on several different laws to change and to remove barriers and to really [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3171.3s)]
*  facilitate investment. An example of the once for only decree law that, for example, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3181.46s)]
*  if you submit a document for an administration, another administration does not have to ask for [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3192.42s)]
*  the same document, which is something structural in terms of fund re-brusher-led and how administration [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3198.98s)]
*  works. So there are small steps, but again, at this, and as I said initially at this stage, [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3205.46s)]
*  this is not enough anymore. We cannot continue on rethinking in terms of small steps because the [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3213.38s)]
*  world is moving and moving very quickly. There are major changes and competition is very hard. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3219.86s)]
*  So what was enough five years ago or three years ago is clearly not enough today. So we absolutely, [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3226.18s)]
*  and I think this is one of the major challenges that hopefully the new governments will be [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3233.22s)]
*  taking into consideration that drastic changes need to happen in terms of really allowing this [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3238.8999999999996s)]
*  ease of doing business in the country and opening the country for competition, at least, you know, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3246.5s)]
*  so bureaucracy is not one of the, because we already have so much barriers, the competition, [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3253.14s)]
*  the crisis in terms of the global crisis. We should be able to actually eliminate the challenges [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3261.06s)]
*  that they are just depending on us as a country and as an economy. And I believe this is one of [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3267.86s)]
*  the key elements for the next government to be working on. Thank you, Mahdi. Just a quick one. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3276.34s)]
*  I think it's important to differentiate our criticism of bureaucracy from a civil servant, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3286.1800000000003s)]
*  because people often say, you know, they start criticizing the people that are there. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3295.3s)]
*  But we need also to put ourselves in the shoes of certain people within the Tunisian [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3300.82s)]
*  administration. One course, there is a culture that needs to be changed, developed, [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3307.06s)]
*  so that the administration becomes more efficient. And that is indeed related to [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3314.98s)]
*  people and how we can make people evolve. But there is also the tools that are put in place [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3321.46s)]
*  at the disposition of the people within the administration. And we talked about digitalization [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3328.42s)]
*  before. Fundamentally, I mean, we still have in Tunisia a certain ministry that are not well [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3332.9s)]
*  connected, that don't have access to even video conferences. And some others that are well advanced, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3338.98s)]
*  like if you were in the US or in Europe, still not consistency in the tools and capabilities [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3345.54s)]
*  and equipment that this administration has to be more efficient. And the other thing also, [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3353.86s)]
*  and it goes back to the usual problem, is the instability of the political system or the change [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3360.58s)]
*  in ministers and government. It's very difficult for the administration, for the civil servant, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3368.34s)]
*  to take risk of sale, to be creative, to be ambitious in the development of a strategy, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3375.46s)]
*  in supporting a specific investment, because they know that potentially someone else will come in [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3384.9799999999996s)]
*  six months or someone else will come in one year and might not like what they've done. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3391.22s)]
*  They might be also taken in front of the judge because they took something in the interest of [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3396.74s)]
*  the country that actually was not written black and white, that they were allowed to do it. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3402.02s)]
*  And it frustrates people and inhibits them. And I think that's also something that we need to [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3406.98s)]
*  work on in Tunisia, is to provide the right spirit to the administration, provide them with the right [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3415.7s)]
*  tools, but also provide them with the right support so they feel themselves empowered to take the [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3422.66s)]
*  right strategic decision for the interests of the country without fearing for themselves. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3430.66s)]
*  Thank you. We just have two minutes left. Iman, did you want to come in with any [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3437.94s)]
*  final thoughts on that question? Very, very quick. I was talking to one of my classmates back to [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3441.46s)]
*  school. She's French. She's based in Paris, and she was talking about the bureaucracy in Paris, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3446.98s)]
*  and she was basically almost like talking about Tunisia. So bureaucracy is everywhere, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3451.14s)]
*  and there is a mindset that I think we inherited from the French, where we control ex ante and not [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3456.02s)]
*  ex post. So you make it very hard to get anything, and once you get it, there is no control. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3464.34s)]
*  So it makes it like there is a few people who have the chance to get in, and once they are in, [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3470.1s)]
*  they have a competitive advantage that doesn't even help promote competition. In some sense, [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3474.58s)]
*  there's a change of paradigm that has to be done with the bureaucracy, where basically the [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3481.54s)]
*  control has to be like in the US, for example, ex ante, not ex post, and not ex ante, meaning like [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3485.94s)]
*  after, and not basically closing the door to begin with. And that's a change of mindset. It's going [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3492.02s)]
*  to take some time. It's starting slowly. I mean, Estonia did that. Estonia was the decision was [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3498.2599999999998s)]
*  pure political decision. They basically decided like everything is basically free access, and they [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3504.34s)]
*  control afterward. I don't know which government is going to do it, but that's the way to go, I think. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3511.14s)]
*  Well, thank you all so much. This has been a really interesting discussion. I think I'm sure [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3519.46s)]
*  our audience has learned quite a bit, and there are many more questions that we have not had the [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3524.74s)]
*  time to answer. But please, I guess you can't really join me, but I will thank you all. I [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3530.02s)]
*  really appreciate this, and I hope everyone who's watching is paying attention as Shijam barks on [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3535.46s)]
*  yet another government transition. And as we know, there have heard there are a lot of challenges, [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3540.5s)]
*  but also a lot of really great opportunities for Tunisia. I wish all of you the best, and thank you [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3544.98s)]
*  so much for joining us and participating in this discussion today. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNthiuBaheU&t=3549.06s)]
