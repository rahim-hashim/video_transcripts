Video Description: The countries of the Arab world are acutely exposed to the accelerating impacts of climate change, including soaring heat waves, declining precipitation, extended droughts, and rising sea levels. These effects will magnify preexisting socioeconomic inequalities and problems of governance, worsening the plight of already vulnerable populations and putting more inhabitants at risk. Join the authors of a new Carnegie compendium for a discussion of these broad challenges and how Arab governments, civil society groups, and other local actors can better address climate change through more inclusive reforms and adaptation policies.

# Climate Change Vulnerability in the Arab World
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [September 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM)
*  Good afternoon, everyone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=0.0s)]
*  Good afternoon from Cairo. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=5.0s)]
*  Good morning to our colleagues in BC and to everyone joining us virtually. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=9.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=18.0s)]
*  Welcome to Carnegie. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=20.0s)]
*  Welcome to the Middle East program. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=21.0s)]
*  I'm so sorry for the little delay we're having. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=23.0s)]
*  We had a bit of a technical issue. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=27.0s)]
*  It's solved. I'm happy to be joining you today with my colleagues to discuss one of our latest publications, looking at the impact of climate change on the Middle East and North Africa, and how climate change and its impacts correlate with vulnerability and governance. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=31.0s)]
*  This is one of our latest publications, which came out from the Middle East program in DC. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=51.0s)]
*  All my colleagues here, joining us virtually. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=58.0s)]
*  My dear colleague Fred weary who edited the volume. My dear colleagues, Sarah your keys for one master and I saw him crazy contributed and myself contributed to the edited volume, and we're here to discuss some of the key findings and to engage with you in the discussion. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=62.0s)]
*  Right after our short presentations. I'm moderating the session today. My name is Amra Hamza we I'm the director of the Middle East program in Carnegie DC. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=79.0s)]
*  And without any further ado, I would give the floor to my colleague Fred really who edited the volume to share some of his insights some of his analytical remarks and then from him to Sarah from Sarah tomorrow on and I saw him thread over to you. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=89.0s)]
*  Thanks so much on her and thank you everyone for joining us and apologies again for the delay I'm going to truncate my remarks, since we're running late so again as armor mentioned you know this this volume is meant to be a sort of panoramic look at nine Arab countries, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=105.0s)]
*  focusing on this theme of vulnerability to climate change and it starts with the assumption that climate change impacts will be felt unevenly across the Arab world, both within countries, and among countries obviously resource poor countries that lack adaptive capacities [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=120.0s)]
*  and infrastructure technology human and physical capital, they're going to be affected severely especially those in the rural sector and the informal sector food insecurity is going to be a huge problem. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=137.0s)]
*  Richer oil exporting states on the other hand are better equipped to withstand the shocks of climate change. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=150.0s)]
*  And I think that's a lot of the other investments like desalinization agricultural project projects, imported food stuffs, you know but these states also face a long term, you know reckoning with their dependency on oil they're going to be tested by the fiscal strains of the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=156.0s)]
*  And I think one of the themes that's emerging from our climate change work is that the, you know, the technical, you know, energy specific solutions aren't enough these for these states to successfully transition they're going to have to adopt a more holistic set of reforms that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=172.0s)]
*  include, you know, regulatory shifts, a whole set of other set of changes to the way they've done business. The third category is, is the fractured or post conflict or failed states and obviously they're incapable of mounting a coherent climate policy and of course there, the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=189.0s)]
*  The situation is very dire and of course, a country that I work on Libya is an oil rich state resource rich but is of course racked by conflict and we saw the tragic consequences of that earlier this month and I can get into that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=206.0s)]
*  So again, one theme that emerges from our work is that you know governments in the region have prioritized mitigation over adaptation and that means, you know, they've taken steps in terms of lowering their carbon emissions they have these grand plans to mitigate climate change but in terms of adaptation. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=221.0s)]
*  In terms of actually protecting their populations from climate change that is already underway, they are lagging and that actually follows a global trend, where there's not a lot of focus and global funding toward adaptation but I think a key theme in our work is that, you know, adaptation real [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=239.0s)]
*  adaptation is a difficult, uncomfortable task for a lot of these governments in the region because it requires addressing a whole set of holistic inclusive reforms involving your citizenry, you know, more structural changes to your old way of doing business, whereas mitigation, it's easier for authoritarian governments to enact those top down executive level changes to their, you know, carbon emissions. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=256.0s)]
*  So again, what we're trying to do here is really link, you know, politics and governance to a more sustainable form of climate adaptation that moves beyond what some have called techno solution ism right just focusing on the sort of green pledges and green projects, again, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=283.0s)]
*  Certainly some climate tasks require a top down approach like, you know, energy shifts water management strategy, but what we argue in all of our papers is that you know society needs to be involved civil society municipalities a lot of the people that are most affected by climate change. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=303.0s)]
*  They're not simply victims but they can be agents for driving climate adaptation they have the local knowledge here we're talking about farmers people in rural regions. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=323.0s)]
*  Again, so this, this is a, I think a departure from a lot of the literature that we've seen on the Arab world for instance, my colleague, who wrote who's not joining us today who wrote the paper on Saudi Arabia Justin Dargan. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=333.0s)]
*  Again, we've seen a lot on climate change with Saudi Arabia in terms of the oil sector, but his paper is talking about the title of it is society centered climate reforms again he's talking about how can Saudi Arabia protected citizenry especially marginalized groups like [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=346.0s)]
*  Like that do and like she ethno sectarian groups from climate impacts and I think that's a departure from a lot of the climate conversation on are in Saudi Arabia. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=362.0s)]
*  So again what we're, what we're arguing is that in this in these papers is that, you know, climate change will really amplify a lot of and magnify a lot of long standing governance problems that we've seen, you know, in the region to include hyper centralization corruption [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=374.0s)]
*  and outside donors and governance governments. So with that, I know we're short on time but I'll turn it back over to you and I can talk about Libya later on. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=424.0s)]
*  Great. Thank you so much for that was, I was going to ask you to share a few insights about Libya but I'll circle back to you. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=436.0s)]
*  Maybe after our colleagues have shared their insights. Thank you so much for this excellent overview and as you've mentioned, this is [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=444.0s)]
*  a first [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=452.0s)]
*  cut of our research on climate change vulnerability and governance. We are continuing our work and country profiles are being prepared. Maybe you can share a few insights from your [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=455.0s)]
*  country profile research on Libya later on. Thank you so much. Now over to you, Sarah, you contributed to the compendium climate change vulnerability and governance with other colleagues at Carnegie chapter on Tunisia, and the way Tunisia [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=468.0s)]
*  government and society has been struggling to address climate change impact and come to adaptation and mitigation strategies under very difficult circumstances. So we'd love to hear more from you and some insights about the Tunisian case over to you, Sarah. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=484.0s)]
*  Great. Thank you so much. And I do want to thank Hailey Claassen who is my co author on the paper and contributed significantly to the paper. So the paper that we have put forward examines the way Tunisian officials have failed to [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=501.0s)]
*  prioritize climate change and the subsequent costs of that failure to Tunisia. And in particular, we look at the deep disconnect between what we see as the sort of de jure ways in which the Tunisian government is addressing climate challenges on paper, but the real de facto approach in which climate adaptation and mitigation is a distant afterthought for the Tunisian president, which has real and serious implications for people across the country. The bottom line is that climate change is exacerbating Tunisia's existing economic [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=513.0s)]
*  crisis and its existing socio economic inequalities, and is hitting Tunisia's traditionally marginalized interior and southern regions the hardest. That aside, it's failed to attract significant attention from the Tunisian government. And according to the government's own estimates, its mitigation and adaptation strategy is going to require close to $20 billion in financing over the next decade, which includes more than $11 billion in international support. And this comes at a time when Tunisia is really struggling to convince international donors to support the [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=543.0s)]
*  country at all, let alone in the climate sphere. And so we argue that while these efforts might have a high price tag, if you ignore them, that price tag goes up even more. And it could, in the long run, cause decreased agricultural production, lower tourism revenues, and increased regular and irregular migration, as well as higher unemployment, which are all challenges Tunisia is facing already. So just very briefly, some of the climate challenges that Tunisia is facing today, they're quite severe. And according to the World Bank, Tunisia is one of the country's most [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=573.0s)]
*  exposed to climate in the Mediterranean, and many sources listed as a global climate hotspot faces a variety of challenges from water scarcity to hotter climates to food insecurity. And we saw this on display just this past summer when parts of Tunisia were forced to undergo government enforced water rationing due to the growing water scarcity that has been brought on by climate change. This has a really direct impact on the agricultural and tourism sectors, which are two of the biggest sectors of Tunisia's economy. And we also see excuse me, we also see rising [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=603.0s)]
*  temperatures contributing to these agricultural challenges. The water temperatures in the Mediterranean, for example, are rising 20% faster than the global average. So really, this is an area, this is not unique to Tunisia, but this is an area that is facing very severe and very imminent challenges. We've also seen this lead to food insecurity. And this year, the wheat harvest was only expected to reach 250,000 tons of grain compared to an average of 1.5 million tons annually. And this is already [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=633.0s)]
*  seen itself results in bread rationing and forced many bakeries to shut their doors. Now, as I mentioned, this is particularly harder for the interior regions who rely heavily on agriculture. Tunisia has three distinct climate zones, which each face its own unique climate challenges. But these interior regions that are already suffering from socioeconomic marginalization are feeling the effects of climate change even more than the coastal areas. So what is the government doing to address these challenges? Now, as I said, there's a just vast disconnect [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=663.0s)]
*  between the de facto and the de jure treatment of climate by the Tunisian government. And while the government has on paper been working to address environmental concerns since 1975, in reality, the government has failed to prioritize climate change in terms of resources and political will. So interestingly, Tunisia was actually the third country in the world to include climate change in its constitution, which it did in the 2014 Constitution and then carried that language over to the 2022 Constitution. And it has several bodies that are established by the government [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=693.0s)]
*  to mitigate climate change and is actively seeking a shift towards renewable energy. But when you look at what's actually been implemented, there's very little. The lack of human resources, lack of financial resources to carry out these strategies mean that the government, while on paper looks pretty good, in reality has done very little. And we see this affecting the lives of the Tunisian people. In a recent aerobarometer survey, for example, 64% of Tunisians said that the government should be doing more to address climate change and 72% [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=723.0s)]
*  say the lack of government initiatives contributes to climate change to a great or medium extent. And in an aerobarometer survey, 83% of Tunisians believe there needs to be additional environmental regulation. So this is not just something that, you know, we as analysts are seeing, this is something the Tunisian people have recognized themselves as well. The other major challenge right now is the hyper local nature of climate challenges. Yet this government under Khay Saeed has centralized the government significantly, eliminated the Minister of Local Affairs, fired all of the municipal counselors, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=753.0s)]
*  and while we are expecting a second parliamentary house that will begin the elections at the end of this year, that body would potentially be responsible for the local affairs. The system of government that has been created under Khay Saeed is based on total control by the central state, which really does not bode well for developing local solutions to Tunisia's climate challenges. And furthermore, we've seen no aptitude in the past four years by this president to work with the local government in a way that's necessary to address the local climate challenges. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=783.0s)]
*  The other actor that's really important in Tunisia in addressing climate change is civil society. And so we've seen civil society step in often to fill in the gap that is left by the government and their failure to address climate change. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=813.0s)]
*  But we've seen civil society organizations frustrated by the lack of government help, the lack of government ability to carry out some of their issues. And in some interviews that we did for this paper, we heard from civil society activists who had devised local solutions to their local climate problems. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=824.0s)]
*  But then when they put those problems and those solutions forward, they were blocked by the Tunisian government and never implemented. So you can see there's this real frustration and real lack of communication between the Tunisian government and civil society. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=840.0s)]
*  So looking ahead, one of the recommendations that we make is that international donors who are still quite involved in Tunisia in the development sphere focus their development efforts on climate change. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=852.0s)]
*  Tunisia's traditional partners, the United States and Europe, are both rightly reticent right now to support the government of Tunisia as Clayside continues to violate human rights and roll back freedoms. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=863.0s)]
*  But climate adaptation and mitigation is one path forward. This is a concrete area to support Tunisia's most vulnerable population and to assist in long term economic growth that the country so desperately needs. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=874.0s)]
*  And so the international community, if it doesn't want to support some of its previous projects, can really like double down here on climate change and focus its development efforts on climate change. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=887.0s)]
*  However, if the Tunisian government and President Tsai in particular fail to address climate change, every other fissure in Tunisian society is going to be aggravated. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=896.0s)]
*  We've seen over the past year that climate related protests worldwide have proliferated. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=905.0s)]
*  And we see in other countries the experience that since climate is so deeply connected to every other part of society, climate protests can quickly expand and include other issues, including ones that threaten the political regime. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=910.0s)]
*  So it's very much in his interest to address climate change. If he continues to block climate mitigation efforts, however, he will likely see continued relative deprivation, the same sort of instability, the factors that led to the 2010-2011 Tunisian uprisings are just going to repeat themselves. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=922.0s)]
*  So the Tunisian government should make an effort, make addressing climate change a central pillar of its efforts to manage the country's current political and economic crises. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=939.0s)]
*  And I'll just end by saying that Tunisia has some really distinct advantages that we don't see throughout the region when it comes to fighting climate change, which is committed civil society activists, local actors that are eager and willing to take on climate change and have the skills to do so. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=947.0s)]
*  And as well as these government bodies and reports, studies, action plans that already exist that lay out the path forward and a donor community that is actively seeking ways to support the country in a political manner that benefits Tunisian people. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=962.0s)]
*  But without the full fledged support of Cai Said, these are all irrelevant. So I'll end it there. Thank you. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=974.0s)]
*  Thank you so much, Sarah, for an excellent presentation reviewing the chapter you and Haley contributed to the compendium. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=982.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for bringing our attention to how government and civil society dynamics impact the way countries in the Middle East and North Africa have been responding to climate change challenges and the importance of having governance prism. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=993.0s)]
*  And when looking at climate change, we're not we're not scientists. We do not work on the scientific component of climate change. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1011.0s)]
*  We work on how climate change is impacting and how it correlates with key features of Arab, Middle Eastern, North African societies, such as societal vulnerability and governance, the different deficits we're facing in the region. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1020.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. I'm sure we'll come back to you with questions from our audience. But let me now go to Marwan. Marwan Masha is our vice president for Middle East studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and Marwan contributed a chapter on Jordan, which I would love to. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1036.0s)]
*  Of course, I read it, but I would love for the audience to hear about Marwan's insights. So over to you, Marwan. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1056.0s)]
*  Thank you so much, Amar. It's amazing how similar the problems are. I'm hearing Sara talk. And of course, I read her paper and press paper and it's amazing how similar many of the problems are across the Arab world. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1062.0s)]
*  Let me say at first that at least I think that climate change is finding its way, however slowly, into the radar screen of the Arab world. It's finally getting some attention, not enough attention, but some attention that it deserves in a region that is going to be affected very, very badly by climate change. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1077.0s)]
*  I mean, Jordan is a case in point. Jordan is both energy poor and water poor in terms of per capita income, per capita share of water. We are the second poorest country in the world. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1100.0s)]
*  And so we are already starting from a very bad situation with no ability to, of course, desalinate water because we are energy poor as well. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1114.0s)]
*  And so climate change, which, you know, promises to have drier climates across the world, but certainly in Jordan, is going to affect mostly the vulnerable communities in the country. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1125.0s)]
*  These are the farmers in the Jordan Valley whose livelihood rely on water that is, you know, increasingly not there. And on refugees, 30% of Jordan's population is refugees today, whether they are Syrian refugees, Iraqi refugees and other refugees. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1142.0s)]
*  And their ability to, for example, get water is already very limited because of the scarcity of water. But with climate change, this situation is going to be much, much worse in the future. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1165.0s)]
*  What is the government doing about it? I don't know if the situation is as bad as it is in Tunisia, Sarah. The government does, I mean, does understand the implications of climate change on the country. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1179.0s)]
*  But of course, most often than not, the policy decisions are taken for economic reasons and not for environmental reasons. In a country that is poor, such as Jordan, it is easy to fall into this trap of, you know, looking at short-term gains instead of long-term ones. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1198.0s)]
*  And an example that illustrates this is taxes on electric cars. So taxes were lifted on electric cars to encourage people to buy electric cars, and then they were reinstated again once the Ministry of Finance saw the revenues, you know, being reduced by the lack of taxes. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1220.0s)]
*  And this oscillating between policy decisions is mainly due to the lack of a holistic approach to governments that Fred talked about and Sarah talked about as well. There is no or little interministerial coordination between the affected ministries. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1245.0s)]
*  So the Ministry of the Environment, the Minister of Agriculture, the Minister of Energy, the Minister of Finance don't talk to each other and often take contradictory policy decisions that affect the other ministry without much coordination. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1265.0s)]
*  And perhaps that is one of the main recommendations that we talked about. One, to have a holistic approach. What I have recommended in the paper is to treat the Minister of the Environment as what we call a sovereign ministry and put it on par with all the sovereign ministries, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Interior, the Minister of Finance. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1281.0s)]
*  These are sort of the key ministries in the country. The Ministry of the Environment needs to have more teeth as a sovereign ministry and needs to lead the coordination among all ministries so that policy decisions are made in coordination with all the affected parties. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1310.0s)]
*  That's one issue. The other issue is the need to leverage global climate change finance. There is a big fund for climate change finance in order to help countries poor as Jordan to implement climate change policies that benefit the country. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1334.0s)]
*  But so far Jordan lacks the capacity to present its case to this fund in a credible and effective manner. And I think the ministries, I don't know if that's the case in other Arab countries, probably it is, but there is no capacity to be able to make use of these funds that can help the country. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1359.0s)]
*  And that's what we need to do to help the government. We are witnessing the start of coordination between the executive and the legislative branch in government in the country, which is good. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1389.0s)]
*  I think more parliamentarians are worried about this issue and are starting to be involved in it, which bodes well. But the relationship with civil society is still not as strong as it could be. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1404.0s)]
*  In Jordan, we have political issues that are tied to the climate change issue. For example, the proposed energy water project with UAE and Israel, where Jordan would produce electricity, sell it to Israel, and in return get water that is desalinated by this energy in Israel and brought back to Jordan with UAE financing. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1421.0s)]
*  So civil society is dead against this project because of the issue with Israel. And so the relationship between the government and civil society has been affected by political issues such as this one to a great degree. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1451.0s)]
*  I think these are the major sort of issues that I want to highlight. The paper goes into detail, of course, about the effect on water, on transport, on agriculture, on energy in the country. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1475.0s)]
*  But the main conclusion I want to draw attention to is, again, the need for a holistic governance approach and the need to address the vulnerable communities, particularly in the Jordan Valley and among refugees. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1493.0s)]
*  Great. Thank you so much, Marwan, for your insightful presentation. I will come back to all of you once we give our colleague, Asam Khayy, the opportunity to present his findings as well. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1514.0s)]
*  I will come back to ask all of you about vulnerable communities and how climate change is impacting different segments of Arab populations in the Middle East and North Africa in different ways and how we could understand vulnerability in a phase in which we're increasingly seeing the impact of climate change on our societies and increased risks from a public health perspective, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1532.0s)]
*  from an access to resource perspective, as well as from an equal or close to equal distribution of resources perspective as well. Thank you so much, Marwan, for your presentation on the Jordan case. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1560.0s)]
*  Let me now move to our dear colleague, Asam Khayy. We're joining us from Beirut. Asam is a researcher at the Malcolm Kerr Center, Carnegie Beirut Center for Middle East Studies. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1578.0s)]
*  Asam and Maha Yahya, who is the director of the Beirut Center, contributed to the compendium on the case of Lebanon, which now I would love to give Asam the floor to share key insights from the case of Lebanon as it pertains to climate change and its impact on different segments of the society in Lebanon. Asam, over to you. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1592.0s)]
*  Thank you, Amir, Fred, Sarah, and Marwan. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone. As Amir mentioned, this is what I'm going to say now and what I'm going to talk about now is basically the intersection of climate change and the ongoing economic and political turmoil in Lebanon. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1615.0s)]
*  It's based on the paper that Dr. Maha Yahya, the director of Carnegie Center in Beirut, and I co-authored for this compendium at Amal Munch. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1636.0s)]
*  So first to provide some context, it's imperative to acknowledge that Lebanon, with its rich history and cultural heritage, is currently navigating through a convergence of crises that have been brewing for an extended period, even beyond the economic crisis that became apparent in 2019. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1645.0s)]
*  These encompass a draining economic collapse, persistent political instability, chronic institutional mismanagement, and the big humanitarian challenge of accommodating and ever-expanding Syrian refugee population. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1662.0s)]
*  These challenges have created the perfect storm of crises that threaten Lebanon's stability and prosperity. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1674.0s)]
*  Within this large number of issues, climate change emerges as a silent yet potent adversary, intensifying Lebanon's difficult challenges. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1680.0s)]
*  According to Lebanon's Ministry of Environment, the spectre of climate change could on its own potentially inflict a further 14% decline in the country's GDP by 2040, in addition to the economic hardships that the country is currently facing. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1688.0s)]
*  So it's essential to recognize that climate change is not just a distant global issue, but one that local experts believe is a concern with immediate and far-reaching applications for Lebanon. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1700.0s)]
*  Lebanon's rapid urbanization, with an overwhelming majority of its populace residing in urban centers, has notably heightened the demand for essential infrastructure and services. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1711.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, government mismanagement across several layers of administration has rendered it increasingly difficult to effectively cater to these developing needs. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1720.0s)]
*  This mismanagement has led to a breakdown of public services, exacerbating the challenges faced by ordinary Lebanese citizens and inhabitants. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1728.0s)]
*  Now, a critical facet of climate change's impact in Lebanon is the concerning reduction in snow cover on Lebanon's famous mountains. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1735.0s)]
*  This unsettling trend has caused a dwindling in the groundwater supply, which is the primary source of water for consumption at agriculture. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1743.0s)]
*  Consequently, water scarcity has become a widespread issue, resulting in soaring costs of water and a bad decline in water quality. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1750.0s)]
*  This has cast a long shadow over agriculture, once a pivotal economic sector in the country, which has witnessed a decline in its contribution to GDP from somewhere around 7% in 1995 to a mere 1.5% in 2021. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1757.0s)]
*  Farmers who are dealing with fluctuating temperature conditions and shifting precipitation patterns are struggling to sustain their livelihoods, and this impacts not only the economy but also food security. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1770.0s)]
*  Lebanon's resource mismanagement has also been a significant contributor to the increasing cost of air pollution, predominantly summing from energy generation through diesel generators and rampant emissions from the transportation sector. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1783.0s)]
*  The country's woeful waste mismanagement further compounds this issue, as the frequent incineration of trash releases a harmful cocktail of polythene into the atmosphere. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1794.0s)]
*  These polythene carry severe health implications and exact a substantial economic toll. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1802.0s)]
*  The deteriorating air quality is not just a health hazard, but also a drain on Lebanon's already suffering economy. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1807.0s)]
*  In addition to all that I've mentioned so far, we have to talk about Lebanon's extensive forests, which include Lebanon's, which include basically the Middle East's largest pine forests, which are undergoing a major threat right now, besieged by expanding wildfires and rampant deforestation. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1813.0s)]
*  Escalating temperatures have led to an uptick in wildfires, while economic hardships have driven individuals to resort to tree chopping for income or even for firewoods. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1828.0s)]
*  This unfortunate scenario not only contributes to climate change, but also exacerbates the vulnerability of Lebanon's delicate ecosystem, the soil erosion and landslides. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1837.0s)]
*  The loss of forests affects Lebanon's environment and also its natural beauty and cultural heritage. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1845.0s)]
*  Lastly, Lebanon's coastal cities, which are home to a substantial majority of the population. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1850.0s)]
*  Today they face the ominous specter of rising sea levels. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1855.0s)]
*  Coastal erosion, flooding, saltwater intrusion, disappearance of cherished beaches and the looming potential for population displacement are all pressing concerns that demand our attention. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1858.0s)]
*  Experts believe that the impact of rising sea levels is not a distant future scenario, but an imminent threat that requires consideration. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1868.0s)]
*  Now, to talk a bit about Lebanon's climate policy framework, while the state has committed to international climate agreements, the absence of binding legislation presents a formidable challenge. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1875.0s)]
*  To address this, our research outlines pivotal actions. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1886.0s)]
*  First, in terms of short-term actions, we mentioned raising public awareness regarding climate change. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1889.0s)]
*  This is the first step in mobilizing a country that we feel is really behind. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1895.0s)]
*  Creating compelling incentives for the adoption of sustainable behaviors is crucial to changing individuals and group habits. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1899.0s)]
*  Enforcing already existing environmental protection laws is essential to curb further environmental degradation. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1907.0s)]
*  And actively promoting alternative energy sources, notably solar panels, can reduce Lebanon's dependence on fossil fuels. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1912.0s)]
*  In terms of meeting to long-term actions, ideally crafting a robust economic recovery plan, which I realize implementing such a plan seems to be an impossible task at the moment. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1919.0s)]
*  But such a recovery plan interwoven with green policies is essential to Lebanon's sustainable future. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1929.0s)]
*  Prioritizing job creation, energy efficiency, and a substantial reduction in carbon emissions, which would play a small part in navigating air pollution. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1934.0s)]
*  And actively seeking financial assistance for crucial climate action, which some of my colleagues just mentioned. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1943.0s)]
*  And environmentally sustainable projects can help Lebanon recover and mitigate climate change simultaneously. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1949.0s)]
*  We added some broad-based efforts, such as encouraging symbiotic partnership between private sector, civil society, and higher education institutions. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1954.0s)]
*  Which can drive innovation and sustainability. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1963.0s)]
*  And cultivating green entrepreneurship initiatives that foster sustainable and green technological innovations. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1965.0s)]
*  Which will be important for Lebanon's future and for the future generations. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1971.0s)]
*  Ultimately, it's paramount for Lebanon to give climate change and environmental protection an important role within its public policy plan. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1975.0s)]
*  Even amidst the turbinacies of ongoing political and economic turmoil, prioritizing climate change, framed within actionable strategies that integrate economic development. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1983.0s)]
*  Can substantially bolster Lebanon's difficult journey toward recovery and long-term prosperity. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1992.0s)]
*  So the idea is Lebanon not only deals with its share of the global impact of climate change. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=1997.0s)]
*  But also safeguards the future of the people that currently reside in the country against an increasingly uncertain backdrop. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2002.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2008.0s)]
*  Great. Thank you so much, Hassan, for your presentation. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2014.0s)]
*  I'm grateful for the way you highlighted the impact of climate change on key vulnerable communities in Lebanon. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2018.0s)]
*  Communities living in coastal areas, which is basically the most populous places in Lebanon. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2028.0s)]
*  As well as the impact of climate change on the agricultural side. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2036.0s)]
*  Let me now to get some discussion between you going between Fred, Sarah, Marwan and yourself. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2041.0s)]
*  Let me circle back to Fred. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2049.0s)]
*  Not only because he is the editor of the Compendium. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2051.0s)]
*  And not because he was under the pressure of starting late and did not speak about Libya. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2054.0s)]
*  I would like to circle back to you for two reasons. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2063.0s)]
*  I would like to start with Fred, one, because Libya just went through a massive disaster. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2066.0s)]
*  Which is climate related. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2070.0s)]
*  But not only climate impacted. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2072.0s)]
*  I mean, this is a disaster where we really see the interplay of climate risks and governance deficits. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2075.0s)]
*  Which I would like you to highlight and address. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2082.0s)]
*  Because it will bring sort of the main argument we're pushing forward in the Compendium. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2085.0s)]
*  In a clear way to our audience. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2091.0s)]
*  So if you could reflect on Libya a bit. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2095.0s)]
*  On the disaster in the city of Derna. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2097.0s)]
*  And why it happened. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2100.0s)]
*  How it could have been avoided and so on and so forth. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2101.0s)]
*  And then secondly, I would like you to reflect within the Libyan context as well. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2104.0s)]
*  On the most vulnerable communities impacted by climate change. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2109.0s)]
*  Is it in the coastal regions of Libya? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2113.0s)]
*  Or are we looking at other places? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2116.0s)]
*  So how should we understand vulnerability as it relates to climate in the Libyan context? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2119.0s)]
*  Over to you, Fred. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2124.0s)]
*  Yeah, thank you, Amr. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2126.0s)]
*  You're absolutely right that the tragic flooding in eastern Libya is really the result of an interplay or a confluence of factors. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2129.0s)]
*  And I do hope it's a wake up call for elites in Libya. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2138.0s)]
*  But also the broader region. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2142.0s)]
*  Really, you know, to recognize the systemic and interrelated nature of all these problems. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2144.0s)]
*  So it just wasn't a weather issue. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2150.0s)]
*  It was the buildup of years of misgovernance, corruption and politics, quite frankly, as well. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2152.0s)]
*  So again, I conducted two visits to Libya to do fieldwork on climate change in July of this year. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2157.0s)]
*  And then, you know, May of last year. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2165.0s)]
*  And again, talking to scientists, meteorologists, everybody. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2168.0s)]
*  I mean, this was long in the coming. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2172.0s)]
*  I mean, my paper identifies flooding as a risk. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2175.0s)]
*  There have been towns in Libya that have been subjected to floods before. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2179.0s)]
*  We know that these extreme weather events are worsening. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2183.0s)]
*  So, you know, why was it so extreme? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2186.0s)]
*  Why did it? Why did DURNA get so afflicted so much? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2189.0s)]
*  Again, it really stems, I think, from Libya's systemic governance problems. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2193.0s)]
*  Of course, we're talking about a state that is divided between, you know, two administrations, two governance. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2199.0s)]
*  That is split within those different administrations. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2207.0s)]
*  In the case of DURNA, it was exacerbated by the politics of that town and sort of Heftar's longstanding isolation of that town. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2210.0s)]
*  Basically, it was under siege. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2219.0s)]
*  DURNA was one of the strongest opponents to Heftar's rise. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2221.0s)]
*  So you had that political layer on top of longstanding municipal neglect that afflicts many Libyan towns. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2225.0s)]
*  So, again, municipalities, local actors across the country are not empowered to tackle a range of climate-related events to include fires, droughts, sandstorms, and flooding. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2234.0s)]
*  But in the case of DURNA, you have the additional problem of politics on top of that. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2246.0s)]
*  You know, again, I think much of this has already been reported in the media. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2251.0s)]
*  The bigger thing that I want to circle back to about vulnerable communities is, like the other countries that were mentioned in this discussion, we're talking about countries on a geographic periphery. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2259.0s)]
*  So in Libya, that is the Jebel Nafusa to the west of Tripoli. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2272.0s)]
*  This is a mountainous region. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2277.0s)]
*  There's an ethnolinguistic dimension there. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2279.0s)]
*  So this is where the Amazigh ethnolinguistic minority live. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2281.0s)]
*  And so that adds a compounding factor. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2286.0s)]
*  In the south, we're talking about the vast desert region of the Fizan, where again you have an ethnolinguistic dimension there with the toriq. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2288.0s)]
*  That's also a thoroughfare for migrants. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2297.0s)]
*  So migrants are especially affected by climate change because so many of them are involved in the agricultural sector in the south. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2300.0s)]
*  And that is being afflicted by water shortages and sustained drought. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2308.0s)]
*  And the last vulnerable area is the area where Derna was in. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2314.0s)]
*  That's the Jebel Akhtar, the green mountains. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2318.0s)]
*  And here I want to emphasize the systemic nature of this because, like my colleague Asam mentioned in terms of Lebanon's forests, Libya has forests on a much smaller scale. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2321.0s)]
*  But again, they have proven to be beneficial in terms of regulating climate events, in terms of keeping temperatures lower, creating microclimates. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2333.0s)]
*  There has been massive deforestation in Libya because of lawlessness, because of criminal groups, militias are basically cutting down the forest, converting them into more profitable businesses, apartments. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2343.0s)]
*  They're selling the wood for charcoal. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2356.0s)]
*  And that has a ripple effect, right? [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2358.0s)]
*  So when you transform the natural environment in certain ways, that is felt in terms of the intensity of sandstorms, intensity of temperatures, and also flooding. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2360.0s)]
*  So there is now a lot of discussion that the flooding in eastern Libya was due in part because that natural mountainous forested environment was transformed. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2371.0s)]
*  So all of this, going back to your point, Amir, all of this is interlinked. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2380.0s)]
*  And again, in the case of Libya, I'll just conclude here, but to echo what Marwan was saying, this is a government that is severely paralyzed on climate policy. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2384.0s)]
*  Of the countries in the world that have signed the Paris Accord, I think there are 196. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2395.0s)]
*  Libya is the only country that has not submitted a nationally determined conservation. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2402.0s)]
*  This is the UN's term for your climate roadmap. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2407.0s)]
*  So they are lagging. There is rivalries. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2410.0s)]
*  The Ministry of the Environment is not talking to the Prime Minister's office over who owns the climate policy. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2413.0s)]
*  The government in the east, Heftar's government, is not really cooperating with the government in the west. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2419.0s)]
*  There's some low-level technical cooperation. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2424.0s)]
*  I was talking to the national meteorological office. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2427.0s)]
*  They don't have sufficient monitoring stations across the country, and there again, it's a problem in the east. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2431.0s)]
*  So all of this is linked to Libya's governance maladies. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2437.0s)]
*  And again, I'm hoping that this will be the wake-up call that Libya's elites need. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2443.0s)]
*  But as Sarah mentioned, we're already starting to see people take to the streets in Libya because of this horrendous disaster in the east. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2449.0s)]
*  Thank you so much, Fred. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2460.0s)]
*  This was really great in terms of, I mean, it's a tragic situation in Libya, especially with the heavy casualties. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2462.0s)]
*  But it's important for us, especially in the Arab world, to realize that this was not simply only nature-induced or climate-induced. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2471.0s)]
*  That there was a great deal of human doing into it. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2480.0s)]
*  Be it we're focusing on governance deficits or we're focusing, in the case of the two dams in Derna, on corruption. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2483.0s)]
*  And where the allocated resources, resources allocated for the maintenance and repair of the dams were wasted and not devoted to them, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2492.0s)]
*  leading to casualties in the thousands of civilians in Libya. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2501.0s)]
*  It's quite important. And I again, I'm going back to a point which Marwan made on gradual evolution of awareness about climate change in the region. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2507.0s)]
*  This is as tragic as the situation in Libya is, this has or is resulting in more awareness across the region of climate change. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2516.0s)]
*  That it's now, it's an immediate issue, not an issue for tomorrow. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2528.0s)]
*  And that it correlates with the way we are conducting ourselves and our businesses from a governance perspective. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2533.0s)]
*  Let me now on the governance point come to you, Sarah, because if Libya has disintegrated the government or governance structures, this cannot be said about Tunisia. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2539.0s)]
*  Tunisia is facing a different set of challenges, political, social and economic, which is, as you mentioned in the beginning, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2551.0s)]
*  I would like you to outline them more, are impacting the capacity of Tunisia government and civil society to address climate change risks. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2557.0s)]
*  How is the situation in Tunisia, the political turmoil or instability or unclear about what will happen next? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2565.0s)]
*  How is the polarization going on in society? How are both of them impacting the capacity of Tunisia to live up to the challenges of climate change? [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2573.0s)]
*  Sure, no, it's a really good question. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2585.0s)]
*  And it's something that gets to the heart of this really just stark difference between the possibilities in Tunisia and the reality. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2587.0s)]
*  And what we see is you have this president, Kaisaied, who's centralized all the government into his own hands, but has not shown any aptitude or appetite for addressing climate change. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2595.0s)]
*  And one of the things that he did that was most harmful is the getting rid of the local affairs minister, firing all the municipal councilors. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2605.0s)]
*  So he has devised a system where you have a parliament that really has very little power that's under his own power. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2613.0s)]
*  And then you're supposed to have this second body that's supposed to address local affairs. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2620.0s)]
*  Tunisia, prior to Kaisaied's self-coup two years ago, had this very impressive 27-year decentralization process that would have really aided climate change because it put so much power into the hands of local officials. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2624.0s)]
*  It had several levels of local action that could take place. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2637.0s)]
*  But because of the fact that Kaisaied has erased that whole process, we're now facing not only this major question of sort of who's in charge. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2641.0s)]
*  One of the things that we were trying to find out in this paper is who is actually responsible for climate change? [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2649.0s)]
*  Who has the power to actually implement some of the strategies that exist on paper? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2654.0s)]
*  And everything just comes back up to Kaisaied. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2659.0s)]
*  And so there's a little bit of hope, I would say, that they're having elections supposedly at the end of the year, December 24th, that will start the process for the second House that will nominally have control over local affairs. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2662.0s)]
*  But it's not going to be the same as it was previously. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2676.0s)]
*  And the other piece that I think your question was getting at it is just this idea of the mistrust or the level of trust that people do not have in government. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2679.0s)]
*  And so, you know, when you're having these real dynamic situations, like we saw this summer with water scarcity, where the government is asking people, forcing people to not have any water for many hours during the day. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2687.0s)]
*  We also just last week, the local power company that controls 99% of power in Tunisia had a blackout for between three and five hours, depending on where you were in the country. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2699.0s)]
*  The entire country had a blackout. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2711.0s)]
*  And so what happens? [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2713.0s)]
*  The president fires the head of that company and replaces him with someone else. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2714.0s)]
*  But that hasn't fixed the problem. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2718.0s)]
*  You have all these different issues. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2719.0s)]
*  People don't trust their government when you don't have water, when you don't have bread, when you don't have electricity. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2721.0s)]
*  It gets very hard to put your trust in that government. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2726.0s)]
*  And this lack of connection between the people in their government is just making all of these challenges so much harder to fix. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2728.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2736.0s)]
*  Thank you so much, Sarah. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2737.0s)]
*  Sarah, I mean, I would love to come back to you and to Fred was questioned on the agricultural sector and the population engaged in agriculture in both Libya and Tunisia and the way they are impacted by climate change. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2738.0s)]
*  What I've been reading about is that agriculture in Tunisia and Libya is losing to a great extent its viability as an activity in which segments, wide segments of the population are engaged. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2755.0s)]
*  And this has huge impact on vulnerable communities such as women in rural areas, poor and impoverished segments of the population in different rural areas. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2773.0s)]
*  So maybe if we have time, I will come back to this. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2783.0s)]
*  But now, Umar, you mentioned at the beginning that Jordan is energy poor and water poor, which makes Jordan one of the most critical cases from a climate change perspective. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2785.0s)]
*  We have rising temperatures. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2797.0s)]
*  We have in the Middle East and North Africa. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2799.0s)]
*  Expectations are that rainfall will become less in the coming years, which will deprive Jordan of some of the limited water resources. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2804.0s)]
*  And then you refer to Jordan Valley and its populations. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2814.0s)]
*  Can you please outline which segments of the population in Jordan are most impacted by climate change? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2817.0s)]
*  And how are they impacted by climate change? [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2824.0s)]
*  Is it the segments engaged in the agriculture business or in cities which in many places in the Middle East and North Africa are more of suffering places from a climate perspective because cities are suffering from energy shortage, from water shortage and so on and so forth. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2826.0s)]
*  Over to you, Umar. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2847.0s)]
*  Thank you, Umar. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2849.0s)]
*  First of all, it's good to realize that 75 percent of Jordan is desert. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2851.0s)]
*  So all of the population of Jordan lives within a very narrow strip along the Jordan River, which itself, you know, can be called really a creek rather than a river. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2859.0s)]
*  It does not have much water. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2871.0s)]
*  Most of the water from the Jordan River, which is Jordan's basically only river, is diverted by Israel in the north to the Negev where they use it for agricultural purposes. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2874.0s)]
*  And all that Jordan gets from the Jordan River these days is flood water. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2888.0s)]
*  So if rainfall is not there, you know, we don't get much water. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2893.0s)]
*  The rest of the water in the country comes from ground aquifers, which are not renewable, most of them, because we have a water deficit every year that forces us to rely on non-renewable ground aquifers. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2898.0s)]
*  And so that's not a sustainable situation. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2915.0s)]
*  That has been compounded by the presence of refugees now. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2919.0s)]
*  So in order to provide water for refugees, particularly Syrian refugees, Jordan is pumping even more water from its ground aquifers that is not renewable. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2924.0s)]
*  In terms of the agricultural sector, even though it only provides five percent of Jordan's GDP these days, so it has gone way down than what it was. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2937.0s)]
*  But of course, the farmers in the Jordan Valley, which is where most of our agricultural products are raised, are the most affected. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2951.0s)]
*  And we're already seeing a migration of these farmers into the major cities, you know, as climate change effects take hold. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2964.0s)]
*  So the farmers in the Jordan Valley are one extremely vulnerable community. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2976.0s)]
*  The refugee community is another extremely vulnerable community. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2983.0s)]
*  But even those in the cities, you know, in summer, for example, you know, now as we speak, Jordanians in major cities are lucky if they get water once a week. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=2987.0s)]
*  And most of the water is then bought from, you know, big tankers. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3002.0s)]
*  And God knows where they bring the water from, probably illegally. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3010.0s)]
*  So we already have a very acute situation in terms of water and with no apparent solution. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3016.0s)]
*  The Gulf countries have been able to sort of, you know, solve it by desalinating water from there. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3027.0s)]
*  But we don't have the money to do it. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3034.0s)]
*  And all desalination attempts, there are many, many projects in the country to just desalinate water from the Red Sea in part, which is again Jordan's only outlet to the sea, have failed. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3037.0s)]
*  So we are in a very, very vulnerable situation, both in the Jordan Valley, but really with the population at large. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3052.0s)]
*  Thank you so much, Marwan. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3063.0s)]
*  You mentioned in your presentation that one of the recommendations you put forward in your paper is to take more of a holistic approach with regard to managing the impact of climate change. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3065.0s)]
*  And I understood that you mean holistic, not only at the government side, but also at the civil society side. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3079.0s)]
*  Can you maybe very briefly outline what you mean by a holistic approach to climate change? [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3087.0s)]
*  Decisions cannot be taken, you know, by one ministry without coordination with the other. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3093.0s)]
*  Let me give you a concrete example, Amir. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3099.0s)]
*  So solar energy in Jordan is abundant because we have a lot of sun and a lot of land. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3103.0s)]
*  And so we have successfully raised the percentage of electricity that we get from solar panels to 30 percent of our needs, of our electricity. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3109.0s)]
*  And that's impressive. That's not bad. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3120.0s)]
*  But then the government started realizing that as people are, you know, relying more on solar energy, they're not using energy produced by the traditional electricity company. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3124.0s)]
*  And so the government is losing revenues. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3138.0s)]
*  And so the long-term benefit for the environment resulting from, you know, energy from solar panels is being ignored by the short-term gains that the country collects from its citizens. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3141.0s)]
*  That's again one of the main problems for a country as poor as Jordan is. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3163.0s)]
*  That economic decision-making almost always trumps environmental considerations. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3169.0s)]
*  And that is why the country has to, and that's another recommendation we have, the country has to build its capacity in leveraging climate change finance, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3179.0s)]
*  finance mechanisms that are being put forward by the world, by the international community, because relying on government revenues alone is not going to do it. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3190.0s)]
*  Thank you so much, Marwan. Asam, let me come to you. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3202.0s)]
*  If the agricultural sector in Jordan does not contribute much to overall GDP, this is not the case in Lebanon. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3207.0s)]
*  This is one of the key sectors in the Lebanese economy. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3215.0s)]
*  And even as in terms of employment, it employs a big number, a big percentage of the Lebanese population, especially women in rural areas. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3218.0s)]
*  Can you outline how the agricultural sector is impacted by climate change? [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3227.0s)]
*  And I'm interested not in the technical aspects, but in the impact on farmers as a vulnerable community in Lebanon. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3231.0s)]
*  Of course. So basically the issue with the agricultural sector is not a new one in Lebanon. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3241.0s)]
*  And what's effectively happening is many of the population that was basically laboring in the agricultural sector is moving from this sector and moving towards the cities and the coast, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3248.0s)]
*  basically because opportunities in the agricultural sector for various reasons, but including climate change, are no longer viable. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3264.0s)]
*  So they're no longer viable because of economic conditions in Lebanon. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3271.0s)]
*  But also they're no longer viable because precipitation patterns are changing and no longer reliable. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3276.0s)]
*  The temperature is increasing. And so some crops are no longer viable. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3282.0s)]
*  So what's happening effectively is we're increasing the size of urban centers. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3286.0s)]
*  We're increasing the size of the portion of the population that's on the on the coast. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3290.0s)]
*  And you can see where this could be a problem in the future, if not right now, of course, because the demand on services, the demand on infrastructure in these urban centers is increasing at a rapid, rapid rate. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3294.0s)]
*  And you add to that, you know, influx of basically Syrian refugees that Lebanon is taking care of right now. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3306.0s)]
*  And so this stress on the infrastructure is really reaching a very, very high level. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3314.0s)]
*  Thank you so much, Hassan. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3320.0s)]
*  You and Marwan highlighted the impact of refugees, which is once again on Lebanon and Jordan from a climate change perspective and very similar to Sarah's and Threats Points on Governance or General Points on Vulnerability. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3324.0s)]
*  The refugee crisis in the region is one key reminder of the fact that climate change does not impact the Middle East and North Africa in a vacuum. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3341.0s)]
*  It impacts us in a societal context and a political context in which we're facing a lot of deficits and unsolved crises. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3351.0s)]
*  I know that we were supposed to to begin at 10.30 a.m. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3359.0s)]
*  We started a bit later. However, we're approaching the hour, so we still have a few minutes left, maybe three. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3369.0s)]
*  I would like to give the three minutes of my colleagues a beat to Fred because he did a wonderful job editing the volume and without them, we wouldn't have been able to put it out. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3375.0s)]
*  So, Fred, I would like you to reflect in the last two minutes away from Libya on the general regional scene. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3383.0s)]
*  And if you're speaking with citizens in Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, and trying to alert them to how significant climate change is and how it relates to governance and existing vulnerabilities, which four or five takeaways would you put forward? [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3392.0s)]
*  Yeah, thanks so much. Again, I think many of those themes have been eloquently addressed by my colleagues. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3414.0s)]
*  And again, I just I just would implore decision makers in the region to not again to not treat this as purely a technical or a scientific problem or an energy related problem. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3420.0s)]
*  It's a whole of government problem. It has to involve, as we've said today, the citizens. It has to involve vulnerable communities themselves. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3436.0s)]
*  And again, I think as we've already said, in many cases, climate change is simply accelerating or magnifying or amplifying problems that people have seen in the region for a long time. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3444.0s)]
*  In addition to these these tragic shocks that come unexpectedly, as we saw in Libya. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3458.0s)]
*  So again, I do hope that this tragic event in a country that I've studied for over a decade is a signal to decision makers across the world and in the Arab world. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3464.0s)]
*  And again, we're not calling for overnight transformation, but I think it's very clear, especially when we look at eastern Libya, that civil society and local actors, you know, they have to be involved. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3477.0s)]
*  You can't get around this problem by by shutting out vast parts of your population from the climate, you know, conversation. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3487.0s)]
*  So I guess that would be my my main takeaway, Amr. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3496.0s)]
*  But again, over to you as as someone who lives in Egypt and we haven't even talked about Egypt. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3500.0s)]
*  Right. Thank you so much, Fred. Thank you so much. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3506.0s)]
*  I mean, I was happy to contribute with a colleague of mine, Mohammed Mouaylem on Egypt, on water resource management in Egypt. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3511.0s)]
*  But my my my my takeaways from an awareness perspective, especially following the disaster in Libya, the tragedy in Libya is that it's important to include local communities, as all of you have just mentioned. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3520.0s)]
*  And because without them, we do not understand the details and the realities of how climate change is impacting our life now, not will impact our life in a few years from now. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3534.0s)]
*  Secondly, I believe it's important regionally to create a sense of solidarity across the region around events, impact related to climate change, like the disaster in Derna, but even around the earthquake in Morocco, because people are becoming more attentive to how our life is going. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3546.0s)]
*  Is changing due to events which are beyond our control. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3564.0s)]
*  And then they raise the right questions regarding representation, inclusion, governance, anti-corruption measures and so on and so forth. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3567.0s)]
*  But let me at the end, thank you, Fred, for your insights. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3575.0s)]
*  Thank you all so much. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3579.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. Let me as well thank our audience who joined us virtually who was patient in the beginning for the technical glitch we have. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3594.0s)]
*  I apologize for your time. And now we will end this session. Thank you so much. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmX85rusnHM&t=3601.0s)]
