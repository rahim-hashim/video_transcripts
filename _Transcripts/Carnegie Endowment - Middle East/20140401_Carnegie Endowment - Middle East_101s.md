# Chayes on Tunisia's Political Settlement
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [April 01, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN6HlnK3x6w)
*  In Tunisia, it was four civil society institutions that really played the key role in breaking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN6HlnK3x6w&t=0.0s)]
*  a deadlock that had brought the country to a standstill by last summer. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN6HlnK3x6w&t=18.12s)]
*  Those institutions were the Bar Association, the Employers Union, something like the Chamber [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN6HlnK3x6w&t=23.04s)]
*  of Commerce, Human Rights League, and most importantly, a leftist labor union. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN6HlnK3x6w&t=29.66s)]
*  These four groups got together when the country was in absolute crisis last July and basically [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN6HlnK3x6w&t=36.54s)]
*  insisted that political parties hash it out and come to some kind of a consensus over [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN6HlnK3x6w&t=44.06s)]
*  a roadmap first for how to move the country past the impasse and then eventually to a [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN6HlnK3x6w&t=52.94s)]
*  constitution which was signed in January. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN6HlnK3x6w&t=59.54s)]
*  For me, what's really important in this story and that might be applicable to other countries [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN6HlnK3x6w&t=61.98s)]
*  that are in political crisis or in transition is the role of non-political institutions [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN6HlnK3x6w&t=67.7s)]
*  that have a certain degree of historical legitimacy and a certain political clout and how those [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN6HlnK3x6w&t=78.14s)]
*  institutions can serve as forcing functions to really push for a negotiated settlement [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN6HlnK3x6w&t=85.7s)]
*  and mediate that kind of settlement. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN6HlnK3x6w&t=95.1s)]
