# The United States and the World: A New Direction?
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [December 16, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y)
*  Good morning, good afternoon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=0.0s)]
*  My name is Marwan Mashar and I'm the Vice President for Study at the Carnegie Endowment [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=7.26s)]
*  for International Peace. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=12.26s)]
*  I want to welcome you all to the Malcolm Kerr Carnegie Middle East fourth annual conference. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=14.24s)]
*  We hold our conference this year under exceptional conditions. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=20.84s)]
*  COVID-19 has resulted in our first virtual conference, a challenge for sure, but also [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=25.36s)]
*  an opportunity to even reach more people than we did before. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=31.92s)]
*  Lebanon has gone through a particularly difficult political and economic crisis and is still [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=38.0s)]
*  going through it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  And by a senseless explosion in August that dashed the remaining hopes of many and resulted [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=45.96s)]
*  in a few thousand deaths and injuries. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=52.58s)]
*  It also resulted in the complete destruction of our offices in Beirut. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=56.12s)]
*  And yet the center has persevered, even I dare say thrived. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=62.46s)]
*  We are very proud to have renamed the center this year after Malcolm Kerr, the late American [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=68.82s)]
*  scholar of the Middle East and the former president of the American University of Beirut. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=75.58s)]
*  Although not an Arab himself, Kerr was a son of the region. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=82.54s)]
*  Born and raised in Beirut, he remained a passionate believer in the promise and potential of the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=87.62s)]
*  region's people and was remarkably dedicated to supporting the next generation of Arab [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=94.74000000000001s)]
*  thinkers and practitioners. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=100.7s)]
*  Our work at the center carries on and builds on his legacy. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=104.18s)]
*  This year also marks the 10th anniversary of the Arab uprisings. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=111.34s)]
*  The transformational phase that the Arab world is going through will not be smooth or linear, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=116.22s)]
*  but a lot of lessons have already been learned, some of which will hopefully help guide the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=122.62s)]
*  region in the next phase as it toils towards pluralism and prosperity. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=129.22s)]
*  This year has also witnessed the election of a new US administration and witnessed developments [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=138.06s)]
*  on the Arab-Israeli front that might result in paradigm shifts in addressing this lingering [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=144.38s)]
*  issue. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=150.94s)]
*  All these issues will be covered at length in this year's conference. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=153.06s)]
*  We are proud to have many of our colleagues from Carnegie centers around the globe in [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=158.16s)]
*  addition to distinguished speakers from outside Carnegie. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=163.54s)]
*  We will begin the conference with an introductory video and then a fireside chat with our president, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=168.57999999999998s)]
*  William Burns, and our director in Beirut, Maha Yahya. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=175.42s)]
*  Good afternoon, everybody. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=211.46s)]
*  I'm Maha Yahya. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=216.78s)]
*  I'm the director of the Malcolm H. Kerr Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=217.78s)]
*  I'm absolutely delighted to be opening the fourth installment of our annual conference, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=223.06s)]
*  a global renewal with a question mark about what to expect in 2021 with our very own Carnegie [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=230.14000000000001s)]
*  Endowment President Ambassador Bill Burns. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=238.22s)]
*  Welcome to today. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=243.61999999999998s)]
*  Let me begin Ambassador Burns by talking about US elections. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=245.85999999999999s)]
*  We're looking at this is a momentous time not only for the United States, but also for [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=250.33999999999997s)]
*  the rest of the world. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=256.94s)]
*  The globally we've been hit by a pandemic and economic turn down, but this is coming [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=259.5s)]
*  on the heels of four years of extremely polarized politics, both in the US, but also around [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=265.53999999999996s)]
*  the world, disintegration and multilateralism, so on and so forth. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=274.41999999999996s)]
*  We saw record turnout in the United States for voting. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=279.65999999999997s)]
*  I believe it was in the order of around 150 million, almost split in half, more for President [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=285.41999999999996s)]
*  elect Biden, but almost split in half. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=294.82s)]
*  So let me begin with the first question in terms of what does this mean for I mean, what [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=297.9s)]
*  do the US election results tell us about the state of domestic American politics, especially [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=307.78s)]
*  the fact that even though he lost the election, President Trump made significant gains in [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=313.78s)]
*  terms of overall votes and the Republican Party actually added many seats in the House [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=319.82s)]
*  and depending on the by-election in Georgia may well retain control of the Senate. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=326.34s)]
*  Robert, you will. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=332.02s)]
*  But first, it's great to be with you as always, and I really am very proud of the work that [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=333.62s)]
*  you and your colleagues at the Carnegie Middle East Center continue to do across the region. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=339.94s)]
*  2020, to make an understatement as recovering diplomats are apt to do, was a very hard year [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=346.85999999999996s)]
*  for all of us around the world, particularly for the people of Beirut, a city that I've [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=354.7s)]
*  loved ever since I first visited nearly 40 years ago. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=360.05999999999995s)]
*  And so for the Carnegie Endowment, our decision to rename the center in honor of Malcolm Kerr [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=364.5s)]
*  a few months ago was not only a tribute to a wonderful man, but it also was a signal [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=370.7s)]
*  of our commitment to Beirut as the platform for our work across the region. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=376.46s)]
*  So now on your question about American politics and the election outcome and the health of [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=381.94s)]
*  American democracy, I mean, the honest answer is if Donald Trump, in my view, had been [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=387.34s)]
*  reelected for a second four years as president, that American democracy would have gone [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=392.62s)]
*  straight into the intensive care unit. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=397.78s)]
*  With President-elect Biden's victory in the election, I think American democracy is on [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=400.66s)]
*  the road to recovery, but it's bound to be a very difficult and fragile recovery. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=406.58s)]
*  And I say that recognizing, as you just remarked, that, you know, much of what happened in [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=411.74s)]
*  terms of the result of the process in our recent elections should give us hope. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=417.86s)]
*  You know, the highest highest turnout in American political history in the midst of a [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=423.62s)]
*  pandemic, which is not a small thing and relatively few problems with the process, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=429.22s)]
*  despite President Trump's continuing efforts to invent them. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=435.14000000000004s)]
*  But it did underscore, as you said, the continued polarization and tribalism in [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=439.06s)]
*  American politics. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=445.74s)]
*  And that's going to create a huge challenge for effective governance. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=448.02000000000004s)]
*  I think President-elect Biden's experience and his instincts and his inclination all [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=451.3s)]
*  make him ideally suited in many ways to try to bridge those differences. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=456.7s)]
*  But it's going to be a very tall order. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=460.74s)]
*  And the last thing I'd say in general terms, as we reflect on the election, is that it [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=463.02s)]
*  did underscore, I think, something we've worked hard on at Carnegie over the course of [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=468.42s)]
*  the last couple of years. And that is the connection between an effective and sustainable [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=473.53999999999996s)]
*  American foreign policy and domestic renewal. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=479.3s)]
*  Because for too long, the gap between people like me, you know, card carrying members of [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=482.85999999999996s)]
*  the Washington policy establishment and lots of American citizens on foreign policy has [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=489.53999999999996s)]
*  grown wider and wider. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=496.26s)]
*  Most Americans, in my experience, don't need to be persuaded of the importance of [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=498.82s)]
*  American engagement in the world, but they've become increasingly skeptical over [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=503.29999999999995s)]
*  administrations of both political parties about the capacity of decision makers to be [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=508.34000000000003s)]
*  disciplined in that engagement, to match ends to means, and especially to conduct [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=513.86s)]
*  foreign policy in a way which is going to help Americans deal with all those huge and [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=519.42s)]
*  sometimes crushing domestic problems of growing economic inequality to show that a [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=524.62s)]
*  smart foreign policy really can be the first line of defense against inevitable external [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=531.46s)]
*  shocks, whether it's climate change or global health insecurity or the revolution in [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=537.42s)]
*  technology. So that's another of the ways, I think, in which, you know, our recent [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=542.54s)]
*  elections have underscored what really is the historic significance of better connecting [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=547.4599999999999s)]
*  foreign policy to domestic renewal. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=554.74s)]
*  Building on this internally, can you perhaps elaborate a little bit on the what a [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=559.38s)]
*  domestic renewal is likely to look like? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=566.34s)]
*  And then we'll talk a bit about the unusual transition and what that means. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=571.1800000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think the first, second and third most important priorities for the Biden [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=575.34s)]
*  administration are going to be navigating past the pandemic, which is a huge challenge [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=581.5s)]
*  for Americans. I mean, it's a very sad commentary that America first has come to mean [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=587.62s)]
*  over this horrible last year being first in all the wrong categories, the number of [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=594.1s)]
*  infections, the number of deaths and the competence that national leadership or the [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=598.7s)]
*  incompetence of national leadership in dealing with, you know, what would be terrible [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=603.46s)]
*  problems for any administration to deal with. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=608.46s)]
*  And then the related challenge of economic recovery, which is bound to be difficult and [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=611.66s)]
*  painful coming out of the impact of the pandemic. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=617.1s)]
*  So that's going to be the first challenge. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=620.66s)]
*  But then I think what the Biden administration is determined to do based on what [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=623.02s)]
*  President-elect Biden has discussed is to try to address some of those deeper drivers of [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=627.54s)]
*  dysfunction in the United States, having everything running the gamut of issues from [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=633.74s)]
*  racial injustice to, you know, to judicial and penal reform in the United States to, you [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=641.02s)]
*  know, moving the American economy and American society more in the direction of clean [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=649.46s)]
*  energy and renewable energies, given the huge challenge of climate change, rebuilding [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=655.82s)]
*  infrastructure in the United States, which is an embarrassment in many ways, as foreign [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=660.82s)]
*  visitors to the U.S. can see these days. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=666.7s)]
*  So some huge challenges to deal with those underlying problems. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=669.9000000000001s)]
*  But, you know, I think President-elect Biden has been quite clear-eyed about the [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=674.2199999999999s)]
*  significance of thinking ambitiously about those problems. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=679.14s)]
*  He'll obviously be constrained if you have a Republican-led Senate in terms of, you [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=682.38s)]
*  know, ambitious attempts to build more resources and more appropriations for those [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=688.0999999999999s)]
*  efforts. But I think he's going to work very hard to try to demonstrate to Americans the [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=694.62s)]
*  importance of finding common ground on those issues without in any way being naive about [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=699.66s)]
*  all of those political problems that still exist. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=705.74s)]
*  So 2021, I think, you know, in a lot of ways, is going to be as important for the United [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=708.22s)]
*  States as, you know, 1989 was at the end of the Cold War. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=713.26s)]
*  It's going to be one of those, you know, hinge points where I think strong and disciplined [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=717.02s)]
*  leadership can go a very long way in dealing with some of those domestic problems. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=722.58s)]
*  And, of course, as you said at the outset, you know, recovering the power of America's [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=727.22s)]
*  example of our competence after the experience of the last few years is going to be a [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=733.7s)]
*  critical driver of effective American foreign policy, too. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=739.38s)]
*  And bridging the gap within, I think, U.S. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=744.22s)]
*  society. I mean, we've never seen these kinds of vertical divisions with people actually [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=747.34s)]
*  drawing examples between the U.S. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=751.82s)]
*  one of our own colleagues that the U.S. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=754.98s)]
*  is becoming the Lebanon in some ways in terms of the vertical divisions we've seen, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=757.0200000000001s)]
*  societal divisions. We've never seen anything this clear, I would say. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=762.0200000000001s)]
*  And this is even in some ways. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=768.2600000000001s)]
*  No, I agree. And I thought that was a terrific piece that our colleague, that Kim Gaddis did. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=769.7800000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=775.9000000000001s)]
*  And I think it should be sobering for Americans, because, you know, over the decades, and I [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=776.7s)]
*  think that this is a diplomat, you know, Americans are very free with their advice to other [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=780.98s)]
*  societies. And we've tended oftentimes to think the world revolves around us. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=785.74s)]
*  The truth is, we have a lot to learn from the experiences, both the good, the bad and the [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=791.6600000000001s)]
*  ugly of other societies. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=795.98s)]
*  And, you know, our own political system has become quite stagnant. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=798.3000000000001s)]
*  And so we need to pay attention to the examples that we see in other societies that face a [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=802.0200000000001s)]
*  lot of the same problems. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=807.62s)]
*  Let me turn to another question, Bill. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=808.9s)]
*  Just how do you think, I mean, we're seeing a very unusual transition where the president [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=811.3s)]
*  still has not conceded the election, still talks about voter fraud. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=818.02s)]
*  It's been almost, you know, like pulling teeth, trying to get the president-elect's team, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=824.66s)]
*  give them access to what they should be getting. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=832.5799999999999s)]
*  How do you think this very unusual transition is going to impact the Biden administration's [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=836.42s)]
*  foreign policy? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=842.18s)]
*  Where will their priorities be? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=843.4599999999999s)]
*  And maybe then we can perhaps talk a bit about the Middle East and where that fits into it. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=846.8199999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=852.1s)]
*  Well, first, I'd say transitions matter enormously, you know, in the American political [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=852.9s)]
*  system. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=858.18s)]
*  I worked over the years as a diplomat for five presidents and 10 secretaries of state. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=858.9s)]
*  On two different occasions, I led the State Department side of a transition with a new [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=864.58s)]
*  administration coming in. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=869.38s)]
*  And so I have a very clear sense of how important it is to try to make as smooth a handoff as [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=871.38s)]
*  you can. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=877.22s)]
*  One of the best transitions that I ever witnessed was from in 2008-2009 from the George W. Bush [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=877.78s)]
*  administration to the first term of Barack Obama's administration. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=884.98s)]
*  Both sides had a very professional approach, and it made a big difference in terms of how [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=889.14s)]
*  that transition played out. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=896.0999999999999s)]
*  By contrast, in the transition from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush, 2000-2001, because it was [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=898.0999999999999s)]
*  delayed by the Florida recount and the controversy, the difficulty at least of formally [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=906.18s)]
*  concluding the election, you know, as the report that was later done about 9-11, the [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=912.98s)]
*  9-11 commission underscored, you know, that had a consequence in terms of the pace of [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=921.54s)]
*  a new administration's ability to come to grips with a lot of threats that were out [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=928.18s)]
*  there. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=932.34s)]
*  So my point is simply that transitions are important. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=932.5s)]
*  This transition is bound to be the messiest in American political history for several [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=936.18s)]
*  reasons. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=942.1s)]
*  First, as you said, you have a president who has effectively checked out of his job, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=942.58s)]
*  who's obsessing right now over the election itself, is transfixed by trying to cast [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=947.38s)]
*  illegitimacy over the outcome and President-elect Biden's victory. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=955.78s)]
*  Second, you have, you know, disarray within the bureaucracy, which has been true for much [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=960.02s)]
*  of the last four years with the hollowing out of a lot of institutions and casting doubt on [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=965.22s)]
*  career public servants. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=972.4200000000001s)]
*  So you have that disarray as well. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=974.58s)]
*  And then third, and not least, you still have some senior advisors around the president [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=976.4200000000001s)]
*  who, even with 30 or 40 days left in the transition, are still looking for ways in which, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=981.86s)]
*  you know, they can either box in a new administration in some policy areas or employ [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=987.5400000000001s)]
*  scorched earth tactics to complicate the life of a new administration on issues ranging [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=992.82s)]
*  from China to Iran as well. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=998.4200000000001s)]
*  So a lot can happen in the next 30 or 40 days, which will affect the inheritance of the Biden [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1000.74s)]
*  administration. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1006.82s)]
*  I think to get to your question about the priorities of the new administration, I mean, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1007.7s)]
*  I can't speak for the Biden administration, but what I would observe is that I think this [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1012.66s)]
*  is bound to be the most difficult inheritance that any new president has faced since Franklin [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1018.02s)]
*  Roosevelt at the height of the Great Depression 90 years ago, almost 90 years ago. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1023.38s)]
*  I think President-elect Biden and the team that he's putting together around him, which [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1030.2600000000002s)]
*  is an exceptional team, are well aware of the reality that the world they're returning to [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1034.9s)]
*  after four years is not the same as the one that they left. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1041.5400000000002s)]
*  You know, on the domestic landscape, all the dysfunctions we were discussing earlier apply [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1045.5400000000002s)]
*  on the international landscape. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1050.3400000000001s)]
*  I think this is one of those very rare plastic moments that comes along, you know, maybe a [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1051.94s)]
*  couple of times a century in international order, transformative moments. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1057.86s)]
*  This one characterized, I think, by three main features. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1063.78s)]
*  First, major changes in the balance of power among states, especially with the rise of China. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1066.6599999999999s)]
*  Second, major challenges that go beyond the reach of any one state. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1073.06s)]
*  You know, those problems without passports like climate change or, you know, the phenomenon of [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1078.6599999999999s)]
*  cyber intrusions or the broader revolution in technology or global health insecurity. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1084.98s)]
*  And then third, and not least, major uncertainties about the role of the main driver of the old [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1091.14s)]
*  post-Cold War international order, my own country, the United States, which is, especially over the [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1097.38s)]
*  last four years, seen by too many people around the world to be erratic or unsteady at the wheel. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1102.42s)]
*  So on the 20th of January, we'll have a new and I think infinitely more competent [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1108.98s)]
*  and reliable driver. But it's not as if the United States can just kind of return to [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1113.94s)]
*  the seat that it held before at the head of the table internationally and be surrounded by [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1120.42s)]
*  deferential allies and partners and suitably impressed rivals. We're going to have to earn that, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1126.42s)]
*  you know, that ability to play a leadership role. And that is only going to come through a much [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1132.9s)]
*  more disciplined approach to leadership, connecting ends to means. And as I said, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1138.98s)]
*  focusing on the priority of domestic renewal, on the priority of, you know, recovering the habit [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1146.66s)]
*  of working with other countries and dealing with those big global challenges. So not only returning [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1153.46s)]
*  to the Paris climate agreement, but demonstrating through our domestic actions, our commitment to [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1158.5s)]
*  clean energy. And then the biggest geopolitical test, you know, for the United States, as far as [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1165.3s)]
*  I can see it at the 21st century, and that's going to be managing an intense long-term competition [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1172.5s)]
*  with China. A China that is in many ways more vibrant economically and more durable politically [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1178.34s)]
*  than the Soviet Union ever was during the height of the Cold War. But the United States has, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1185.3s)]
*  I would argue, and I don't mean this as a statement of American arrogance, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1191.06s)]
*  has a reasonable hand to play. I would argue a better hand to play than any of our major rivals, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1195.1399999999999s)]
*  not just because of our economic leverage and our military leverage, but because of our capacity [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1201.22s)]
*  to draw on alliances, mobilize coalitions of countries. I mean, that's in a way the capacity [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1207.86s)]
*  that sets the United States apart from lonelier powers like China and Russia. But we're going [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1213.9399999999998s)]
*  to have to work very hard at that because a lot of those alliances and partnerships [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1218.5s)]
*  are going to have to be rebuilt, as Biden says, you know, built back better. And that's going to [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1223.46s)]
*  require a lot of effort beyond, you know, the initial size of relief in at least many parts [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1228.98s)]
*  of the world and the initial kind of, you know, mutually self-congratulatory summits and meetings. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1235.06s)]
*  It's going to require a lot of hard work to reinvent a lot of those relationships. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1241.22s)]
*  How do you see, since we're talking about relationships, I mean, one of the relationships [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1248.66s)]
*  took a significant hit, obviously, is the one with Europe, the transatlantic relationship, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1253.46s)]
*  whether on trade but also on foreign policy, on multiple avenues. How do you see the Biden [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1259.38s)]
*  administration going around, going about perhaps mending those ties, the relationship with NATO [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1265.22s)]
*  and with others? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1272.26s)]
*  Sure, no. And when I talk about, you know, the high priority that the United States is going to have [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1275.86s)]
*  to attach to managing competition with China, rivalry with China over the coming decades, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1280.82s)]
*  I don't mean to suggest that other priorities don't matter. And certainly the transatlantic [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1287.3s)]
*  relationship matters enormously. In recent years, we've seen what are in effect political nervous [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1291.78s)]
*  breakdowns on both sides of the Atlantic. And you've seen a Trump administration, which [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1297.7s)]
*  has actually been a cheerleader, not just for Brexit, but for fragmentation of the European [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1303.22s)]
*  Union, and has cast doubt on, you know, the wisdom of the NATO alliance as well and the nature of [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1308.9s)]
*  America's commitment to it. So there's a lot of, you know, rebuilding to do, given the corrosive [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1314.98s)]
*  damage that's been done. What's going to be important, I think, in transatlantic relations [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1321.06s)]
*  is to focus, of course, on security issues and the importance, you know, of European allies [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1325.94s)]
*  stepping up and, you know, doing their share of, you know, of, you know, taking on those security [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1331.46s)]
*  missions and improving their own defenses. But it's also going to mean the United States being a [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1338.1000000000001s)]
*  little less patronizing, which tends to be our attitude oftentimes, and Europeans, by the same [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1344.5s)]
*  token, being willing to take more initiative and, you know, absorb more risk. So not just on security [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1350.1s)]
*  issues, but on questions of recovering from the pandemic and economic recovery, beginning to [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1356.1s)]
*  develop workable rules of the road on technology, narrowing the differences, which are obvious today [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1363.4599999999998s)]
*  between EU and the United States over questions of taxation and regulation and the geopolitics of data. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1369.2199999999998s)]
*  Because if we can't narrow those differences with allies and partners in Europe, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1376.58s)]
*  there's no way that any of us are going to build up the leverage to be able to deal effectively [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1381.54s)]
*  with much different visions coming from authoritarian countries like China or Russia on many of those [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1387.06s)]
*  same issues. So, and climate change is obviously another opportunity, I think, to deepen cooperation [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1393.86s)]
*  between the United States and Europe. China and the challenge that China poses is obviously going [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1400.42s)]
*  to be another important priority in transatlantic relations. And by in saying that, I don't mean to [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1407.0600000000002s)]
*  suggest that what is likely to emerge is an identical set of strategies to dealing with China. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1413.14s)]
*  But I do think it's possible to build complementary and coordinated strategies in dealing with, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1419.46s)]
*  you know, challenges ranging from 5G technology all the way through global health cooperation [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1426.02s)]
*  as well. So a transatlantic alliance, I think, becomes very important in terms of each of those [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1432.02s)]
*  priorities that I mentioned before that I think the Biden administration is going to have to focus on. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1437.62s)]
*  Let me move to another tenuous relationship, which is Russia. You spent a good part of your [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1445.06s)]
*  own professional career in Russia. I'd like to hear from you perhaps how you see Biden administration [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1453.14s)]
*  relationship with Russia. Will we see a change in policy, a change in attitude, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1459.5400000000002s)]
*  or more of the same when it comes to Russia, both on international issues, but also, I think, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1466.8200000000002s)]
*  in relation to that to kind of make our way into the Middle East slowly. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1474.42s)]
*  Sure. No, no. Well, most of my white hair came from serving in Russia, at least the parts of my [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1479.54s)]
*  white hair that didn't come from serving in the Middle East. Both are challenging sets of issues. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1485.38s)]
*  I guess what I would say is that I think, you know, American strategy toward Russian-American [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1491.54s)]
*  relations with Russia are probably going to operate in a Biden administration and beyond that, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1497.38s)]
*  within a pretty narrow range of possibilities, from the sharply competitive to the nastily [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1502.58s)]
*  adversarial. You know, in my experience, Vladimir Putin is a very combustible combination of [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1509.1399999999999s)]
*  ambition and grievance and insecurity. He's been, you know, in the now nearly 20 years, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1516.4199999999998s)]
*  or the 20 years that he's been Russia's leader, kind of an apostle of payback in dealing with [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1522.34s)]
*  the United States, you know, giving his sharp sense of Russia's period of humiliation in the [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1528.1s)]
*  1990s, after the breakup of the Soviet Union, and a period in which I served in our embassy in Moscow, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1534.8999999999999s)]
*  so I remember it vividly. I still remember vividly also my first meeting with Putin [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1541.3799999999999s)]
*  as the newly arrived US ambassador in Moscow. This was August of 2005, and, you know, the meeting [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1547.62s)]
*  takes place in the Kremlin, which as some in your audience may know is a place that's built on a [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1555.14s)]
*  scale that's meant to intimidate visitors, especially newly arrived American ambassadors, so [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1560.5800000000002s)]
*  you walk through down these long corridors, through these huge ornate rooms, and you come to the end [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1565.8600000000001s)]
*  of one of these huge ornate rooms, and there are these two-story bronze doors. You're kept waiting [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1572.0200000000002s)]
*  there for a few minutes just to let all this sink in. The door opens a crack, and out comes [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1577.14s)]
*  President Vladimir Putin, who despite his bare-chested persona is not all that intimidating [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1582.66s)]
*  in the flesh, but he carries himself with great self-assurance, so he came through the door, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1588.74s)]
*  and before I got a word out of my mouth, says in Russian, you Americans need to listen more. You [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1593.6200000000001s)]
*  can't have everything your own way anymore. We can have effective relations, but not just on your [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1599.94s)]
*  terms. In my experience, that was vintage Vladimir Putin. It was not subtle. It was almost defiantly [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1605.38s)]
*  charmless, but the message was that Russia is going to push back in areas that it sees to be [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1611.78s)]
*  vital to its interests, and so that doesn't mean that you don't need guardrails in the U.S.-Russia [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1618.1s)]
*  relationship. I think one of the early challenges for the Biden administration is going to be [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1623.46s)]
*  the reality that the New START agreement, which reduces, verifies, monitors the strategic nuclear [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1629.06s)]
*  arsenals of the United States and Russia, still today the only two nuclear superpowers in the [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1637.14s)]
*  world, that that agreement is going to expire in February of next year, so a couple of weeks after [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1642.26s)]
*  President-elect Biden is inaugurated. There's a very strong argument for extending that agreement [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1649.3000000000002s)]
*  is provided for in the treaty, and that's going to be an important demonstration, I think, that for [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1656.18s)]
*  all of our very sharp differences, the United States and Russia have both unique capacities in [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1660.9s)]
*  the nuclear area, but also unique responsibilities as well. And then, just as you suggested in the [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1666.5s)]
*  Middle East, whether Americans like it or not, you know, it's going to be important to deal with the [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1671.86s)]
*  Russian government, given its own influence, especially increased influence over the last, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1677.3s)]
*  you know, five or six years in different parts of the Middle East. So it's going to be, again, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1683.7s)]
*  to put it mildly, a very challenging relationship for the new administration to manage. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1691.62s)]
*  Let me then, since we're now, we've moved to the Middle East, you were involved previously in all [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1698.1799999999998s)]
*  the back channel negotiations with Iran, and you've written about this in your book, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1704.58s)]
*  as well as your said you're in Russia. Let me ask you, what will the Biden policy towards Iran, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1711.4599999999998s)]
*  do you think, be? And how would the possibility of a Trump administration escalation with Iran [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1718.98s)]
*  complicate what seems to be President-elect Biden's push to renew or re-enter the JCPOA, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1729.8600000000001s)]
*  and then kind of work on other things simultaneously? I mean, the drive from what [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1738.42s)]
*  we've heard from the incoming administration is to sequence, first get back into the JCPOA, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1745.3s)]
*  and then start talking about other things, including sanctions relief, including a regional [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1752.58s)]
*  dialogue. I mean, all the issues that were kind of more of a bottleneck at the time and that [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1757.22s)]
*  served to derail, I think, the JCPOA in some ways, or at least it was increased with open arms [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1765.06s)]
*  in different sectors or amongst different groups. I noticed that over the years. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1771.6200000000001s)]
*  No, I mean, I think you're right that President-elect Biden and his incoming senior [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1778.8200000000002s)]
*  advisors have made clear that their intent is to return to compliance with the comprehensive [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1783.3000000000002s)]
*  nuclear agreement if, and it's a big if, the Iranian government is prepared to return to [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1790.42s)]
*  full compliance as well. The Biden team has made equally clear that they see the challenge of Iran [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1796.26s)]
*  and American policy as part of a comprehensive strategy of which the nuclear issue is only one [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1803.22s)]
*  part. On the nuclear issue, Biden has made clear that he would simultaneously, with returning to [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1809.94s)]
*  compliance if that becomes possible, initiate an effort to build on that first agreement and [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1818.26s)]
*  strengthen the nuclear agreement in ways that are going to further ensure that Iran will be prevented [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1826.66s)]
*  from developing a nuclear weapon. I mean, even when the last administration negotiated [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1833.86s)]
*  the comprehensive nuclear agreement, we all understood that this was meant to be the [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1839.3s)]
*  beginning of diplomacy, not the end of it. Like any arms control process, you build on it. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1844.02s)]
*  But that's only, as you well know, one part of the challenge that's posed by this Iranian regime, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1850.18s)]
*  this Iranian government, its development of increasingly sophisticated ballistic missiles [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1857.22s)]
*  are an obvious concern and an obvious challenge. And so are continuing efforts on the part of the [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1863.62s)]
*  Iranian government to subvert other governments throughout the region. So that's going to require [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1870.66s)]
*  very close cooperation, I'm sure, in a Biden administration with our partners in the region. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1877.6200000000001s)]
*  I think there are, again, without being naive about it, I think there are a few places where [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1884.1000000000001s)]
*  there may be some possibilities for hard-nosed diplomacy along those lines. Yemen, I think, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1888.9s)]
*  could be one of them. Again, as you know very well, not only a strategic catastrophe, but a [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1895.38s)]
*  humanitarian catastrophe, the worst one on the planet today. An effort at serious diplomacy in [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1901.5400000000002s)]
*  which the United States has a very active role is long overdue. And that's going to require not just [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1909.6200000000001s)]
*  pushing the Iranians, given their backing for the Houthis in Yemen, but it's also going to require [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1916.42s)]
*  pushing the Saudis as well on this issue. And we can get to that later, but I think [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1922.02s)]
*  after four years of what I would argue are kind of blind indulgence of the current Saudi leadership, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1928.9s)]
*  at least on a variety of fronts, on Yemen, on a number of human rights issues, not least the [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1935.3799999999999s)]
*  murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a fairly mild-mannered critic of the Saudi regime in a Saudi diplomatic [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1942.1s)]
*  facility in Istanbul. It's important for the United States not to check its values at the door [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1950.34s)]
*  on issues like that, but to push back hard. But I do think on Yemen, there could be an opportunity, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1956.34s)]
*  and I recognize all the difficulties in making diplomatic progress, but this could be a moment [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1962.1s)]
*  where a Biden administration could help make a difference and help bring about a real possibility [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1968.4199999999998s)]
*  of a diplomatic settlement there, because it's long overdue, as I said before. And that's going [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1974.98s)]
*  to require pushing the Iranians, but also pushing the Saudis, I think. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1981.94s)]
*  I couldn't agree more, but let me ask just one other question on the Iran issue, which is, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1988.02s)]
*  do you think there are policies that were enacted by the Trump administration, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=1996.58s)]
*  which the Biden administration would be able to leverage in its negotiations with Iran? And I'm [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2001.7s)]
*  thinking in particular things like the sanctions, I mean, some of the earlier sanctions, not the more [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2007.1399999999999s)]
*  recent ones. Are there things that could also help push some of the negotiations further in this sense? [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2013.54s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think, you know, much as I've disagreed with the Trump administration's [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2021.46s)]
*  approach, the maximum pressure approach, it's done enormous damage to the Iranian economy, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2026.02s)]
*  and there are a lot of Iranian citizens who are suffering as a result of that, too. So that's [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2032.26s)]
*  created a circumstance, I think, in which there may be greater incentive for the Iranian government [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2039.38s)]
*  to try to move back to compliance with the comprehensive agreement. But I think that, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2045.54s)]
*  at least as I understand what President-elect Biden has said, is the immediate objective, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2050.66s)]
*  which is to return to full compliance, which would mean the United States returning to full [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2055.94s)]
*  compliance as well in terms of sanctions relief as well. It's going to be important, I think, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2060.8199999999997s)]
*  to de-escalate the rhetoric early on, and also to de-escalate, you know, in terms of some of the [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2066.1s)]
*  restrictions on humanitarian supplies going to Iran, you know, which, you know, have contributed [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2072.8199999999997s)]
*  to real human suffering there. And, you know, this is a population that suffers enough already [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2079.94s)]
*  from a deeply repressive leadership. So I think there are things that could be done early on that [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2085.14s)]
*  might increase the odds of a successful return to compliance. But as I said, that's just, you know, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2090.18s)]
*  one step in what has to be a comprehensive approach or a comprehensive strategy in dealing with, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2096.9s)]
*  you know, with the challenge posed by this Iranian leadership. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2103.7000000000003s)]
*  Actually, assuming we still, we need to know what Iran wants at the end of the day, because [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2106.82s)]
*  that also would play an enrichment that seems has increased tremendously in the past few years. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2115.6200000000003s)]
*  Well, you know, and that's been the downside, the huge downside of the maximum pressure approach, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2123.06s)]
*  you know, which originally it was argued would produce a better nuclear agreement. And instead, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2128.34s)]
*  what we have is not only no nuclear agreement, you know, in effect, but also, you know, an Iranian [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2133.78s)]
*  government, which is steadily moving out of compliance, which has, you know, built up a [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2140.7400000000002s)]
*  stockpile of enriched uranium, which I think at last count was 12 times what it was, you know, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2145.94s)]
*  when the Trump administration came in into office. So, you know, the Iranian leadership is building [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2152.1000000000004s)]
*  has been building up its own chits in a way for, you know, the diplomacy that's to come. And so [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2156.5800000000004s)]
*  you know, I understand how difficult this process will be having lived through it before, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2164.42s)]
*  but I do think I do think that President-elect Biden is focused on the right issue at the start. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2169.46s)]
*  And then the challenge if that's successful is going to be to, you know, build a strategy [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2176.1800000000003s)]
*  that deals comprehensively with that whole range of ways in which Iran can threaten the interests [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2181.5400000000004s)]
*  of friends and partners across the region. Let me use that as a segue to talk about the [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2187.7s)]
*  friends and partners in the region. President-elect Biden has talked about having a, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2194.1s)]
*  you know, after the values free holiday that we've had over the past four years, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2200.1s)]
*  he's talking about bringing values back to foreign policy, making foreign policy be values based. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2205.46s)]
*  What would that mean in a region that is now coming up on the 10th anniversary of the Arab Spring? [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2211.54s)]
*  And where we've seen tremendous authoritarian regression [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2220.74s)]
*  in multiple places across the region. How do you see US policy playing out in such a context? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2225.3s)]
*  And where do you see, I mean, what is the future of [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2235.38s)]
*  democracy, I would say, in countries across the region? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2241.14s)]
*  Well, you know, I mentioned before, Maha, I mean, you raise a very profound question and one that [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2246.26s)]
*  oftentimes doesn't get the attention it deserves in American strategy in the Middle East. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2250.82s)]
*  I recognize as clearly, I think, as anyone, the trade-offs that are often involved in [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2256.34s)]
*  policies in dealing with authoritarian regimes, but it's a huge mistake, as I said before, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2261.54s)]
*  it would be a huge mistake to continue the values holiday we've seen over the last four years. And [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2267.86s)]
*  I say that for, you know, a very simple reason. I think that while a lot has changed in the region [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2273.38s)]
*  in the 10 years since the Arab Spring, what hasn't changed are the underlying causes of the Arab [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2278.5s)]
*  Spring, of those revolutions across the Arab world. And, you know, that's far better than I do. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2285.62s)]
*  The indignity that caused people to go out in the street courageously and protest against, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2290.42s)]
*  you know, deeply repressive leaderships, the sense of lack of economic opportunity and fairness, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2297.54s)]
*  the inability of people to express themselves politically in many societies. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2304.5s)]
*  And the challenge, of course, is that leaderships and societies in the Arab world or any place else [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2310.26s)]
*  that don't address those underlying challenges are going to become brittle and break. And those that [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2315.94s)]
*  do, I think, have a chance of becoming healthier and more durable and more sustainable. And they [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2322.58s)]
*  also are better partners for outsiders like the United States over time. So none of this is a [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2327.78s)]
*  favor to the United States. It's deeply in the self-interest of societies across the region. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2332.58s)]
*  Having said that, you know, the honest answer about Arab democracy today, as you know, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2338.7400000000002s)]
*  I talked before about, you know, had Trump been reelected in the United States, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2343.14s)]
*  American democracy going into the intensive care unit? Well, that's exactly where Arab [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2346.98s)]
*  democracy is right now. Not a terminal condition. I'm enough of an optimist about what's possible. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2351.3799999999997s)]
*  I remember vividly what all of us saw on the screens and experienced 10 years ago. But, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2357.62s)]
*  you know, this is going to be a toll order because the counter reaction was massive [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2363.2999999999997s)]
*  across the region and it continues to be very powerful. So where does this leave American [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2369.14s)]
*  strategy? I mean, first, I think we have to Americans in terms of the U.S. government's policy [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2374.26s)]
*  have to keep focused on the deeper drivers of dysfunction in the region. And here, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2381.46s)]
*  again, what you and Marwan Mawassir and our colleagues, you know, in the Carnegie Middle [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2386.82s)]
*  East Center have done for the last few years and focusing on those deeper drivers of change, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2391.62s)]
*  I think has been a real service, especially to the younger generation of thinkers and practitioners [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2396.9s)]
*  across the region, because that's the great social, political, economic challenge ahead. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2402.58s)]
*  And the United States needs to pay attention to that. Of course, we need to recognize the [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2407.38s)]
*  limits of our influence. You know, we spent a good bit of the two decades after 9-11 engaged [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2411.94s)]
*  in magical thinking about our capacity to transform other societies, especially in the Middle East, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2418.42s)]
*  while at the same time neglecting the importance of transforming our own society. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2424.82s)]
*  As you know, the consequences of globalization became clearer and clearer. So we have to recognize [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2429.94s)]
*  the limits of our influence. And I suppose for a Biden administration, we also have to recognize [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2435.2200000000003s)]
*  the importance of rebuilding the power of our example in the world. I always found as a diplomat, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2440.02s)]
*  whether it was in the Middle East or elsewhere, we get a lot farther through the power of our example [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2445.3s)]
*  that we do through the power of our preaching, freely dispensed as that often is. And we have a [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2450.18s)]
*  very corroded power of example right now that, you know, we're going to have to work hard to rebuild. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2456.4199999999996s)]
*  But assuming we can do that, I think we have to be willing to speak out on issues of human dignity [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2461.2999999999997s)]
*  and human rights and civil society, whether that's whether with regard to non-Arab players in the [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2467.54s)]
*  Middle East like Iran, as I mentioned before, or the increasingly illiberal democracy in Turkey, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2474.18s)]
*  or, you know, longtime partners in the United States and Egypt or in Saudi Arabia as well. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2480.74s)]
*  You know, a continuing values holiday, a continuing blind indulgence of autocratic regimes on those [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2486.66s)]
*  issues, no matter how many other areas in which we cold bloodedly need to try to work together, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2493.22s)]
*  you know, that's going to be a mistake for American policy. And I've made as many mistakes over the [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2499.46s)]
*  course of my career on those issues as anyone. I know how hard it is to get that balance right. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2504.98s)]
*  But I think in the Biden administration, you're going to see much more of a focus on those issues [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2510.34s)]
*  by contrast to what we've seen over the last four years. And that's a good thing. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2516.34s)]
*  That would be a very good thing, actually, especially, I mean, this for people in the [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2521.1400000000003s)]
*  region where we've seen, for example, President Macron just give the Legion d'honneur to [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2525.62s)]
*  President Sisi, who, you know, literally days after they've we know how repressive [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2532.9s)]
*  the regime in Egypt has been. I'm going to end Bill with a, I mean, with this fantastic discussion [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2539.54s)]
*  with one last question. We cannot finish without talking about Lebanon. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2548.3399999999997s)]
*  You've traveled in and out of Lebanon since the 1980s, the early 1980s, actually. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2552.8199999999997s)]
*  Could you perhaps say a few words about how you see it fit into a broader US policy [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2560.8999999999996s)]
*  towards the region? [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2568.1s)]
*  Yeah, no, I'll probably close when I'm more uplifting, no, if I can. But I mean, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2572.5s)]
*  the first thing I'd say is that as you know, and you know, any Lebanese citizen knows far better [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2577.7799999999997s)]
*  than than me or any other outsider, it's pretty grim diagnosis today, you know, an economic collapse [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2583.2999999999997s)]
*  aggravated badly by the terrible explosion in Beirut last August, a stagnant and in many ways, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2591.7799999999997s)]
*  deeply corrupt political system, dealing with the continuing burdens for Lebanese society of [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2598.98s)]
*  the spillover from the civil war in Syria, whether that's refugee issues or other kind of problems, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2606.9s)]
*  you know, in dealing with the habit, you know, over the decades, not only of Lebanese leaders to [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2613.3s)]
*  deepen the tribalism of Lebanese politics, but for outsiders to take advantage of that, [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2618.98s)]
*  you know, to be predators in a sense on that. And there are plenty of those today, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2623.7s)]
*  as well with Iran, I think, being near the top of the list. And so it's it is a pretty grim [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2627.54s)]
*  diagnosis. Having said that, you know, I've I've seen Lebanon in a number of different states from [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2634.2599999999998s)]
*  the civil war, you know, that was still raging in the 1980s failed foreign interventions, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2640.18s)]
*  including the US military intervention. When I was a very young diplomat serving at the embassy [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2646.58s)]
*  in Jordan and visiting Beirut to, you know, much more uplifting moments, I was leaving just at the [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2652.66s)]
*  end of four years as the head of the Near East Bureau in the State Department at the beginning [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2660.66s)]
*  of 2005, when the Cedar Revolution took place. And there I saw, you know, a manifestation of [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2665.54s)]
*  resilience on the part of Lebanese. And so I can only imagine how hard it is today. But I do hope [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2671.3799999999997s)]
*  for two things. The first is that, you know, Lebanese themselves will be able to recover that [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2679.3s)]
*  sense of resilience and that outsiders, friends like the United States needs to continue to be [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2684.7400000000002s)]
*  will pay attention and will try to focus its assistance on, you know, on areas which really [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2691.7000000000003s)]
*  are deeply in need of reform to hold Lebanese political leaders to account in ways that will [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2699.1400000000003s)]
*  serve not only the Lebanese people over the short, medium and long term, but also serve the [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2705.38s)]
*  interests of a healthy US Lebanon partnership over that time as well. So I don't mean to [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2711.3s)]
*  underestimate any of the challenges, but I do hope very much that in the years ahead, [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2716.82s)]
*  you know, American administrations will pay attention to Lebanon because, again, as you know, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2722.02s)]
*  far better than I do, it's an extremely fragile state today. And the United States does have a [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2728.02s)]
*  stake in Lebanon's stability and in its future health as grim as the circumstances may seem today. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2733.94s)]
*  Bill, thank you so much for a wonderful conversation and a great tour of a broad [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2741.54s)]
*  range of issues that will be facing the US and the world. I'm still hoping for some sort of a global [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2749.2200000000003s)]
*  renewal, but we all have to wait and see. Me too. No, I'm an optimist by nature and now you'll have [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2756.18s)]
*  a chance, I think, in the following panel with my friends and colleagues, Ryan Crocker and Ashley [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2763.06s)]
*  Telles, for them to correct everything that I just said in a wrong way. So anyway, good luck [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2768.66s)]
*  with the rest of the conference. I'm sure it's going to be wonderful, but thanks so much for [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2774.82s)]
*  this conversation, which as always, I thoroughly enjoyed. Thank you, Bill. Thank you very much. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2778.58s)]
*  Hello, everyone. We're now continuing our panel. This was a pre-recorded session with our Carnegie [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2784.2599999999998s)]
*  President William Burns, Ambassador William Burns. Apologies for the quality of the video, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2790.58s)]
*  but it will be available on our website as of this evening. We will now continue our discussion on [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2797.14s)]
*  whether the election of President-elect Biden, the results of the recent US elections, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2806.02s)]
*  what impact they will have not only on global policy, but also on domestic policy. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2815.54s)]
*  With me on this panel to continue this discussion are two colleagues from Carnegie, from the Carnegie [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2822.34s)]
*  Endowment, former ambassador Ryan Crocker, who has served extensively in a number of different [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2835.06s)]
*  administrations and across most of the Middle East. Many people have been following Middle East [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2843.2999999999997s)]
*  politics for some time will know Ryan quite well. And I have to give him particular thanks for [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2847.7799999999997s)]
*  waking up incredibly early this morning to be with us. He's based in Los Angeles. Also with me [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2854.5s)]
*  on this discussion is my friend and colleague, Ashley Telles, who's based in Washington. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2863.06s)]
*  Ashley is the Tata Chair and the Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2868.34s)]
*  Welcome to both of you. We've heard Bill talk about the momentous transition that is ahead of us, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2876.58s)]
*  one of the messiest transitions that we have seen in a long time, the divisions that are [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2887.7000000000003s)]
*  very evident in the United States, polarization at levels we haven't seen before, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2895.54s)]
*  and the potential impact on foreign policy. So, Ashley, let me begin with you. Almost a year ago, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2902.3399999999997s)]
*  China was crowned zero for the coronavirus. And if you recall, in the first few months of 2020, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2909.7799999999997s)]
*  some American commentators were looking at COVID-19, the spike of infections, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2917.14s)]
*  and the way that China dealt initially with the pandemic. They looked at it as China's Chernobyl, [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2924.1000000000004s)]
*  particularly Wuhan. It was considered as China's Chernobyl, a kind of disaster that would [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2930.5800000000004s)]
*  really expose the weaknesses of Beijing's rule. But as 2020 comes to an end, we're looking at [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2937.46s)]
*  United States, where actually the COVID-19 has had a tremendous impact on the presidential election [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2946.58s)]
*  to all intensive purposes. It continues to overshadow a politically divided nation. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2956.66s)]
*  And there is still, I mean, the number of people who are dying is increasing. We're looking now at [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2966.34s)]
*  more than 300,000 deaths in the United States alone, and new cases, hundreds of, sorry, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2972.82s)]
*  thousands of cases every day. Now, many people believe that, respective of their position on [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2979.7000000000003s)]
*  foreign policy, the United States is in a moment where it must be strong at home to be strong abroad. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2985.46s)]
*  And the critical pillar of the US power really lies in its middle class, its dynamism, its [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=2995.94s)]
*  productivity, its political and economic participation, and its promise of progress [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3001.54s)]
*  and possibility to everyone else. Now, you recently co-authored the report on foreign policy for the [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3006.34s)]
*  middle class. So I thought perhaps you could tell us a little bit more about the report [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3012.5s)]
*  and the implications of its findings for the next administration. What does a foreign policy for [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3017.06s)]
*  the middle class mean, and why this link between the domestic and foreign policy? [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3022.34s)]
*  Sure. Thank you, Maya. Thank you for having me here. It's great to be here at this conference. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3029.22s)]
*  Let me start by addressing the question that you asked quite directly. There are two big themes [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3036.02s)]
*  that came out of the work that we did over the last couple of years. Unlike the rhetoric that [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3042.74s)]
*  was associated with the Trump administration, our findings, and this comes from thousands of [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3049.22s)]
*  interviews with people across the country, three in-depth studies of Middle Eastern American states, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3055.62s)]
*  and then, of course, the final report that we put together. The two big headlines are first, [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3063.06s)]
*  there is no constituency in the middle class for America's disengagement from the world. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3068.58s)]
*  It's simply a myth to say that the United States is not interested in the world and that we somehow [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3075.2999999999997s)]
*  ought to disengage from it because of pressing problems at home. That's simply not our finding. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3081.94s)]
*  So there was a very strong view across the board that the US has to stay engaged in the world, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3088.66s)]
*  and irresponsible American leadership is exactly what it's called for. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3096.5s)]
*  However, that leadership has to be attentive to the costs of America's engagements abroad, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3101.14s)]
*  and those engagements abroad cannot be conducted at the expense of the well-being of the American [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3108.66s)]
*  population. This means not just having a smart foreign policy, but it also means having a foreign [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3115.7s)]
*  policy that is very attuned to its impact on the American population, especially the middle class. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3123.38s)]
*  To my mind, this was actually a good news story because I was afraid going in, after all the [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3130.66s)]
*  rhetoric about America first, that there was a constituency in the United States arguing for [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3136.26s)]
*  disengagement, and we found precisely the opposite. Americans want to be engaged in the world, [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3142.0200000000004s)]
*  but they want to be responsibly engaged, and they want that engagement to better their own lives at [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3148.98s)]
*  home. I think that's a very reassuring message from the study that we did. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3154.1800000000003s)]
*  Thank you, Ashish. But can you perhaps talk a little bit more in terms of what does this mean [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3160.18s)]
*  for the next administration's foreign policy priorities? [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3165.7s)]
*  Sure. Thanks, Maha. I mean, so the first, I think the first insight that comes out of the study [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3170.1s)]
*  is that the globalization of the last 30 odd years has done an amazing job at increasing aggregate [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3177.14s)]
*  levels of wealth. So when you look at the United States today compared to where it was, say, 30 [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3186.3399999999997s)]
*  years ago, and look at the wealth increase in the United States because of globalization, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3192.02s)]
*  they've been very impressive. However, those aggregate increases in wealth have not been [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3197.06s)]
*  shared equitably across the population. And even though we have grown richer because of our [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3203.8599999999997s)]
*  involvement in the world, we have also become a much more unequal society. And so the question [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3211.78s)]
*  then becomes, you know, how do you deal with inequality? Now, we did not find a large [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3217.54s)]
*  constituency arguing for simply governmental action to redress inequalities in terms of state [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3224.1000000000004s)]
*  programs. But there was a demand that the nation start looking at the things that actually make [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3233.62s)]
*  the middle class stronger, investing in education, investing in research and development. So instead [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3240.42s)]
*  of providing payouts, the idea was to focus the benefits of our global involvement in programs [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3247.54s)]
*  that would actually help build our middle class through education, through education, through [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3255.14s)]
*  middle class, through education, through investments, and so on and so forth. And that I think is what [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3261.86s)]
*  any responsible government ought to do, but which we in the, you know, in our enthusiasm [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3268.5s)]
*  about the efficacy of markets forgot that very often, however efficient markets are, they also [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3275.22s)]
*  accompanied by very significant market failures. And the state has a responsibility to address [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3281.62s)]
*  those market failures through targeted strategies. And so targeted strategies that focus on [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3287.3s)]
*  investments in people, even as we continue to engage in the world, is really what I think [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3293.38s)]
*  the good news from that report is about. Well, I would say some of these recommendations [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3299.94s)]
*  would apply to most countries around the world, I think, in many different ways. I don't think [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3306.34s)]
*  there's a single country I can think of where this would not be as significant and as important. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3313.06s)]
*  But in any case, we'll come back to this issue of domestic renewal shortly. Ryan, let me turn to you [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3318.66s)]
*  now and talk about what this means for a new US policy for globally. What do you think the, [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3324.18s)]
*  I mean, how will domestic policies affect US foreign policy? What will the priorities [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3336.5s)]
*  of President-elect Biden's administration be? What lessons do you think they've learned from [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3342.02s)]
*  the past 12 years between President Obama and President Trump? And how will that impact both [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3347.14s)]
*  their foreign and domestic policy and defense policies? It's a great question, but just as an entry point. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3354.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, thank you, Maha and Ashley. Very good to see you again. I commend the [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3364.58s)]
*  Carnegie Endowment for bringing forth this very important conversation about America [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3371.14s)]
*  in the world. It starts, of course, with America at home. We have always been an inward-looking [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3379.38s)]
*  society. Foreign policy has been important, but it does not touch the importance of domestic society. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3385.7799999999997s)]
*  And that's the first problem the President-elect is going to have to deal with. The incredibly [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3393.54s)]
*  fissures that this latest election has brought out in our society, not that it was [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3400.98s)]
*  not pretty bad before. I'm actually not in Los Angeles. I'm outside of Spokane, Washington, [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3407.78s)]
*  which is where I was born and always where I have situated myself, at least psychologically. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3416.1s)]
*  So up in this particular area, a whole lot of those 71 million people who voted for President [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3424.2599999999998s)]
*  Trump in November are still very much there. Why did they vote for President Trump? Well, [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3430.82s)]
*  every voter will have a different story. But clearly they felt that the American Dream, [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3441.54s)]
*  the post-World War II American Dream, wasn't working for them. So the President-elect has [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3446.74s)]
*  got a huge lift to make in the middle of this pandemic to start to bring society together again. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3452.74s)]
*  The good news, I can't think of anyone better equipped to do that than the President-elect. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3463.54s)]
*  Also the good news, he knows how government works at home and abroad. And he's putting together [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3472.4199999999996s)]
*  really a top team to help him all this. The bad news, a huge lift. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3478.1s)]
*  Where do we go from here? What does it mean in an international context? Well, first, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3490.58s)]
*  I think we have to acknowledge that the retrenchment of the United States did not begin [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3497.06s)]
*  with President Biden. It actually began, in my view, with President Obama, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3501.38s)]
*  who even before he was elected, talked about our so-called allies in the Middle East, like Egypt [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3506.98s)]
*  and Saudi Arabia, who spoke disparagingly of the free riders in NATO. It's a valid point. They are [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3513.7s)]
*  riding free. But his focus was inward in a way that we really haven't seen since World War II. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3521.54s)]
*  Of course, President Trump put that on steroids, clearly. But we were already moving away from the [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3528.5s)]
*  American global leadership role that had its foundation built by President Roosevelt and [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3537.38s)]
*  President Truman. The best example you can see, and both of you have lived this, [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3543.94s)]
*  is the refugee crisis, worse since World War II. Yes, it was. And the Obama administration, [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3549.7000000000003s)]
*  by and large, just stayed out of it. It's a Middle Eastern problem. It's an African problem. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3562.7400000000002s)]
*  It's a European problem. It's not an American problem. Well, the Russians weaponized refugees [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3569.78s)]
*  with its merciless bombing of civilian centers in Syria, deliberately pushing [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3578.26s)]
*  several million Syrians out of their own country and toward Europe, where, in the absence of U.S. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3589.1400000000003s)]
*  leadership, we saw Europe move to its most divided point since World War II. So the challenge of today [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3594.6600000000003s)]
*  at its roots, again, I think back with President Obama, how do we move forward? [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3603.54s)]
*  That is indeed the challenge. And again, the team we've got is the best team I can imagine to do it. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3612.58s)]
*  But it is going to be unbelievably hard. And I could go on for even longer than I already have [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3620.42s)]
*  on specific issues, but I'll leave it there for the moment. Thanks again for having me. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3627.06s)]
*  Thanks, Fran. Let me just do a follow up to that. The team actually that we have in place now, [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3633.54s)]
*  or that seems to be coming together, much of it is a carryover from the Obama administration. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3639.7s)]
*  Many of them served under President Obama. How significantly different do you think the policies [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3644.82s)]
*  of President-elect Biden's administration will be? How significant will the policies be, [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3651.94s)]
*  given that it's a similar team, at least more or less, to what was there before? [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3658.98s)]
*  And then I want to zoom in a bit on defense policy. Are we going to see more troop withdrawals? [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3664.34s)]
*  But let's just begin with nuance. Well, again, Maha, it all takes place within the context of our [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3670.1800000000003s)]
*  domestic situation, I think. The President-elect, and as he has said he would, has to be full bore [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3682.74s)]
*  into the management and eventually control of the pandemic. It is interesting when we think about [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3691.7799999999997s)]
*  the criticisms of American foreign policy. One of the main ones has been that it is overly militarized. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3701.7s)]
*  Well, here at home, the effort to quickly and equitably distribute the vaccines [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3709.3s)]
*  is under the direction of a serving U.S. military officer. I don't think you're going to hear a lot [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3719.3s)]
*  of voices here complaining about the militarization of domestic policy because of this approach. But [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3725.06s)]
*  it does make me smile just a bit. Again, we have veterans here. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3734.8999999999996s)]
*  Lloyd Austin, Department of Defense, Secretary of the Designate of Defense, Tony Blinken, of course, [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3745.2999999999997s)]
*  Secretary of State Designate, Averill Haynes as DNI, Director of National Intelligence. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3751.94s)]
*  These are people who know how the world works. Again, it's going to be very, very hard to [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3759.14s)]
*  translate that into reality, particularly at a time where both for obvious reasons of our national [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3765.22s)]
*  health and future, the focus has to be on the pandemic. And I would just note here, [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3771.7799999999997s)]
*  the death toll in America has now passed 300,000 individuals dead. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3781.94s)]
*  That exceeds the total number of combat casualties suffered by America in World War II, [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3789.46s)]
*  December 41 to August 45. This is a world war. We are not leading it. And until we fix it at home [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3796.2599999999998s)]
*  and then start working abroad to some better results than we've seen so far, [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3807.7s)]
*  this is the oil-consuming crisis. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3813.94s)]
*  Thank you, Ryan. Ashley, let me turn back to you since we're talking about, [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3815.9399999999996s)]
*  well, we're talking about major challenges. One of the things that Bill pointed to, [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3824.02s)]
*  and we all know that this will be a foreign policy priority for the new administration, [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3829.62s)]
*  which is China, managing the intense long-term competition with China over the coming decades. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3834.98s)]
*  You recently wrote about how the US can reorient its relation with China by working with Europe. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3841.54s)]
*  And yet this is coming at a time when transatlantic relations themselves have taken a [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3847.46s)]
*  significant hit in the last four years. Can you speak a little bit, can you speak a little about [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3851.7799999999997s)]
*  how do we narrow the difference with Europe, restore some measure of confidence to transatlantic [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3858.5s)]
*  relations, and how do you see this cooperation with Europe to address China? [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3865.6200000000003s)]
*  Thanks, Ma. So the basic approach to China, I think the last four years have demonstrated, [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3872.42s)]
*  cannot be unilateral because the purely unilateral approach is not a recipe for success. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3878.5800000000004s)]
*  The challenges that China poses to the United States in the economic arena are very, very [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3886.1000000000004s)]
*  similar to the challenges that China poses to Europe. And therefore there's a compelling [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3892.42s)]
*  argument to be made for a more cooperative transatlantic and trans-Pacific partnership [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3897.2200000000003s)]
*  with respect to dealing with China. And my hope is that a Biden administration will go back to [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3905.3s)]
*  basics. First, of course, to do exactly what Ambassador Crocker suggested, to do exactly [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3914.42s)]
*  what Ambassador Crocker suggested, which is to focus at home, address the challenges that we face [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3920.74s)]
*  at home, the most important being pandemic recovery and then stimulating economic growth [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3926.66s)]
*  and consequence. Two, revitalizing our relationships with our allies. I think the last four years has [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3931.62s)]
*  shown a quite stunning disregard for our allies. And this is not simply debates about burden [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3940.4199999999996s)]
*  and financial contributions, but the simple lack of respect that we have shown with partners who [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3945.7799999999997s)]
*  have helped us build a world for 60 years or 70 years has really been appalling. And so going back [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3953.14s)]
*  to resuscitating those relations, because that's the only assurance that we will be able to manage [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3960.2599999999998s)]
*  the restructuring of our competition with China in productive ways. That's the only reassurance [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3968.98s)]
*  that we do it together and not unilaterally. Thank you, Ashley. Ryan, let me turn to you now [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3973.46s)]
*  back with a question on, you know, Ashley's talking about the need to deal with China on a [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3987.54s)]
*  bilateral or multilateral approach, particularly with Europe and the inability to deal with China. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=3995.86s)]
*  Can we talk about the Middle East? Let's zoom in on the region where Carnegie Middle East Center is [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4004.58s)]
*  based. What do you think the new administration's key priorities will be? Most likely, obviously, [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4010.9s)]
*  the return or not return to the JCPOA will be one of them. And to what extent, how do you see [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4022.1s)]
*  that happening? And to what extent can we see cooperation with Europe in dealing with the JCPOA? [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4029.38s)]
*  I think here there is a great opportunity, and Ashley was absolutely right to talk about the [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4040.3399999999997s)]
*  importance of our alliances. Those webs of alliances are what made our leadership [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4047.46s)]
*  role in the world possible. We have never thought and certainly never been able to [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4055.62s)]
*  do it all ourselves. It is in concert with allies, and of course those [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4061.54s)]
*  alliances have taken a major, major hit. We all heard the NATO secretary general expressing his [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4066.42s)]
*  deep distress over the decision by President Trump to reduce our force in Afghanistan [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4073.62s)]
*  down to 2,500, an issue on which we hadn't even consulted with NATO about. So rebuilding those [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4081.22s)]
*  alliances is going to be important. And again, you've got the team here who really know how to [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4091.22s)]
*  do that. Also, again, understanding that for Americans and indeed for our own national security, [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4096.26s)]
*  it's what happens here first that is going to be critical. JCPOA is how do we reenter, if we reenter? [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4102.98s)]
*  What are the issues at play here? We are getting very, very close to an unintended armed conflict, [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4114.419999999999s)]
*  I think, with Iran. One more misstep by either side could land us there. But we also have to [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4123.94s)]
*  remember in pursuing the JCPOA, President Obama basically lost the support of almost the entire [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4130.66s)]
*  Middle East region. Again, you and Ashley have literally lived this with your engagement in that [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4140.58s)]
*  area. Our traditional allies in the region were deeply, deeply distressed by the way [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4147.139999999999s)]
*  they read his emphasis on Iran. So we had the good news is we managed to unite the Middle East by [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4160.34s)]
*  and large. The bad news is it was unification based on their deep dislike and distrust of the JCPOA. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4167.78s)]
*  You know, from Israel to Egypt to Saudi Arabia, you name it, no one there was sorry to see, [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4176.82s)]
*  no leader there was sorry to see President Obama go. So the president-elect is going to have to [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4185.62s)]
*  figure out a way to deal with Iran, to deal with the JCPOA, but to do it in a manner that does not [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4192.5s)]
*  further erode our relationships in the rest of the region. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4201.78s)]
*  What options do they have? I'm just going to push a little bit more on this issue. What options do [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4205.94s)]
*  you see ahead of the engagement? What options does the Scarlet administration have? [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4211.06s)]
*  Well, first, I think their options are driven by their obligations. The primary obligation [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4221.54s)]
*  in a societal way is what can this administration do to overcome the bitter divides we now have in [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4230.820000000001s)]
*  this country? We've been divided before, never to this level, of course, but I recall when [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4240.74s)]
*  George H.W. Bush was elected president after two terms of Ronald Reagan, his secretary of state, [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4250.58s)]
*  Jim Baker, as his first priority, did not choose NATO. He didn't choose the Middle East. He didn't [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4257.7s)]
*  choose China. He chose Capitol Hill. Repeated calls, repeated visits from day one to engage, [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4264.26s)]
*  particularly the Democrats, to say this is Bush one, it's not Reagan three, [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4274.5s)]
*  particularly on the crisis of the moment then, which was our Central American policies. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4282.18s)]
*  He worked that very, very hard and as a consequence was able to bring enough political [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4288.74s)]
*  harmony to ensure that Operation Desert Storm, the liberation of Kuwait in 1991, [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4295.86s)]
*  had the necessary backing in public opinion and on the Hill. So I think the president-elect is going [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4303.54s)]
*  to have to do a listening tour of his own in pretty short order, talking to, in the first instance, [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4310.74s)]
*  Republicans on the Hill. Now, you can only have a conversation if you have two parties and sadly, [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4320.34s)]
*  I think the Republicans in the Senate and in the House have been pretty irresponsible, frankly, [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4326.66s)]
*  in being the party of no. So we'll see what happens on the Georgia by-elections on January 5th, [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4333.86s)]
*  but assuming the Republicans gain control of the Senate, the administration is going to have to [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4344.9s)]
*  find a way to talk to congressional Republicans about a whole range of issues. And one of those, [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4350.74s)]
*  of course, is going to be Iran and the JCPOA. But I think that's where it starts. I would [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4357.62s)]
*  certainly not advise him to make any policy moves, Iran or frankly, anywhere else, without [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4363.54s)]
*  at least making the effort to engage meaningfully with Republicans on the Hill. And I would add to [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4370.42s)]
*  that perhaps also some Democrats, because if we recall some of the Democrats, also members of the [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4376.9s)]
*  Democratic Party, were not voted actually against the JCPOA. Actually, let me turn to you with a [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4381.62s)]
*  final question and then I'll come back to you, Ryan, just to close it up with another question [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4387.14s)]
*  on the Middle East. But I wanted to ask you, Bill spoke about problems without passports. We're [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4393.06s)]
*  talking about climate change. We're talking about cybersecurity. Which of those do you think will [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4397.9400000000005s)]
*  be a top priority for President-elect Biden? And where will they focus their efforts and in what [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4403.14s)]
*  way? We've seen him appoint former Secretary of State John Kerry as his envoy on climate change. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4410.9800000000005s)]
*  So obviously, that's a big issue. But how will this translate effectively? [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4417.700000000001s)]
*  Well, I think we are going to shift from a model of zero-sum approaches to the world, [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4423.3s)]
*  to mix some approaches. And this will mean that we will be in competition sometimes with our allies [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4433.46s)]
*  and in cooperation sometimes with our competitors. I am hopeful that when we get into this new phase, [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4440.580000000001s)]
*  we will do this with greater calculation and with greater strategy. Because this, as Ryan pointed [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4450.66s)]
*  out, is not going to be easy. We know President-elect Biden has identified dealing with the environment [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4457.86s)]
*  and climate change as critical. He's identified cooperation with respect to managing this pandemic [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4465.78s)]
*  and future pandemics as important. I would also flag the whole question of global trade and [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4472.82s)]
*  international trade as being a system that is in need of dire repair. All of this is going to require [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4481.219999999999s)]
*  cooperation with some of our competitors, most importantly China. But how we do it is going to [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4488.9s)]
*  have knock-on effects of great consequence. These are not easy. And let me identify what I think the [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4496.98s)]
*  fundamental challenge is. The fundamental challenge to my mind is the following. If you emphasize [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4503.139999999999s)]
*  cooperation with China and your competitors over and above cooperation with your allies, [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4510.179999999999s)]
*  you leave your allies really nervous. And that creates real problems. If you emphasize [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4516.98s)]
*  so much partnership with allies and competition against your adversaries, then you lose the [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4524.34s)]
*  opportunities for making greater gains than you might have had if you could bring your adversaries [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4531.54s)]
*  on board. And now navigating through this dilemma is really what the vice, I mean the President-elect [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4538.42s)]
*  is going to have to deal with for the duration of the storm. And in Asia in particular, the [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4547.860000000001s)]
*  country is going to be, does he focus on balancing China even as he cooperates with it? Or is he [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4553.14s)]
*  going to focus overly on cooperating with China, neglecting the issues of balance? And then there [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4560.660000000001s)]
*  are consequences of that choice for all America's partnerships. None of this is going to be easy. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4566.18s)]
*  But I think given the kind of person he is and the kind of people he has, I am hopeful that we [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4572.9800000000005s)]
*  will have a more sophisticated foreign policy than we've had in the last four years. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4579.38s)]
*  I think that will be very difficult despite the tremendous challenges that [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4587.54s)]
*  the US and the world is facing. Ryan, let me turn back to you with the final question on, again, [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4594.1s)]
*  coming to the Middle East, coming back to the Middle East. Do you think there will be a significant [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4599.9400000000005s)]
*  shift by the administration on the US policy, Syria policy? We've seen a shuffling back and forth [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4606.18s)]
*  under President Trump, both on whether troops are leaving or not leaving, leaving allies out in the [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4614.1s)]
*  cold. We've lived it all. So the question is, how do you see, would you see any changes? [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4623.62s)]
*  And I would be remiss if I don't tag onto that a question on Lebanon, since Carnegie is based in [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4629.54s)]
*  Beirut. And I asked Bill a similar question, which is how do you see policy by the administration [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4635.38s)]
*  policies or President-elect Biden's administration's policies towards Lebanon as well in this broader [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4640.74s)]
*  Middle East? First, let me just, again, endorse what Ashley said about China and the risk there [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4647.62s)]
*  of being seen, the new administration being seen as catering to China in a manner that is inimical to [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4659.9400000000005s)]
*  the interests of our allies. That's exactly the same issue for the Middle East and Iran. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4670.5s)]
*  By pursuing and concluding the JCPOA, the Obama administration watched its relations with our [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4679.860000000001s)]
*  traditional allies async to new lows. And that, again, is what I was trying to say earlier. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4688.18s)]
*  That challenge is there. How do you do enough to make the world safer without doing so much? You [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4696.18s)]
*  badly damaged the alliances that have always been the core source of our strength. On Syria, [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4704.02s)]
*  I would expect the new administration, again, to proceed with great care. I would certainly hope so. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4710.18s)]
*  This is not the moment, again, for a brand new initiative on Syria. There, again, I think it [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4719.860000000001s)]
*  needs to be on the agenda for conversations with our allies, our traditional allies and our [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4727.54s)]
*  adversaries as well. What Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon in particular, Israel share is borders with Syria. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4734.42s)]
*  They're right in the middle of it, not half the world away. What do they think? How do we get at [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4747.62s)]
*  this in a more effective way? How do we move toward a longer term stability in Syria and, by [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4752.42s)]
*  extension, the rest of the region? And that, like everything else, is going to be quite difficult, [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4761.86s)]
*  but, again, I think doable. And, again, I think the president-elect is putting a team in place who [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4767.299999999999s)]
*  have demonstrated time and again that they know how to do these things. Lebanon, [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4773.7s)]
*  just one minute on Lebanon, a place near and dear to me. I spent six years in Lebanon, [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4782.259999999999s)]
*  first as political counselor at the embassy and then as ambassador in the 90s. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4789.7s)]
*  I've asked Lebanese why we're now seeing this massive outflow, people moving to Dubai, the [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4796.98s)]
*  states, wherever they've got a second passport. Why this? Why now? The August blast was horrific, [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4805.62s)]
*  no question. Death toll around 200. Well, Lebanon has seen far worse days. I was there for some of [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4813.38s)]
*  them. What happened this time? And the response I've gotten back is we've lost hope. We kept going [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4822.5s)]
*  all those years because we had a hope that somehow our country, our society could pull itself out of [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4830.82s)]
*  this, that now we no longer believe it. So how do you restore hope to a population? [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4837.86s)]
*  Through inspired and visionary leadership. Inspired and visionary leadership in Lebanon [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4844.66s)]
*  is actually not coming to a movie theater near you anytime soon. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4851.54s)]
*  That's a very dire note to end this conversation on, but unfortunately our time is almost over. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4858.0199999999995s)]
*  We are looking at a very difficult next few years. We have tremendous challenges [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4866.5s)]
*  for the United States, but also for the region. Our next panel will be addressing some of the [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4873.78s)]
*  regional actors and the emerging Middle East. We are looking at an incredibly different Middle East [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4880.5s)]
*  from one that was around four years ago. It's a post-Pax Americana Middle East where [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4885.78s)]
*  the regional balance of power has changed dramatically. There are agreements between [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4895.14s)]
*  Arab states and Israel. There are new alliances emerging at the same time as countries in the [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4900.820000000001s)]
*  region are interfering more and more in each other's affairs. Massive conflicts, refugees, [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4908.740000000001s)]
*  the problems are endless. So first I would like to thank both Ryan and Ashley for a fantastic [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4914.900000000001s)]
*  discussion. I look forward to hosting you both again soon in more follow-up discussions, I hope, [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4921.46s)]
*  on some of these issues and others. I would ask everybody to tune into our next panel, [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4928.18s)]
*  which will zoom in even further on these regional actors and the new or the emerging Middle East, [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4934.74s)]
*  if you like. Ryan, Ashley, thank you so much. Thank you. It's a pleasure, Maha. Take care of [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4941.3s)]
*  yourself. Thank you. Bye-bye. Thanks. Great to see you both. Good to see you too. Bye. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H275pn8498Y&t=4946.58s)]
