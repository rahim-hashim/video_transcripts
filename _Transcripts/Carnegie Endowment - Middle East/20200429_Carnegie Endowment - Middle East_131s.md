Video Description: Islamic institutions wield significant influence in the politics of the Arab world, but the coronavirus pandemic could change the way regimes interact with clerics. Particularly in war-torn Yemen, opposing factions have largely ignored the pandemic. How is the coronavirus affecting relationships between religious and civil authorities, and how have Islamic actors responded?

# Coronavirus and Islamic Cleric-State Relations
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [April 29, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo9WInCIA4I)
*  As the coronavirus spreads across the Arab world, Islamic institutions are mobilizing to confront the public health crisis through measures such as physical distancing and the closure of mosques and the curtailment of pilgrimages in the case of Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo9WInCIA4I&t=0.0s)]
*  These measures are an important test of Arab regimes legitimacy and trust, and they're going to grow more important during this holy month of Ramadan, when there's a strong desire by the faithful for communal gatherings like the Iftar meal. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo9WInCIA4I&t=16.0s)]
*  But in the long term wake of the pandemic, the relationship between Islamic institutions and Arab regimes could be reconfigured. Governments could exert greater control over their clerical establishments, or the clerics could negotiate greater privileges and authorities. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo9WInCIA4I&t=29.0s)]
*  In conflict-afflicted states, however, clerical authorities are using this pandemic as part of a broader factional war, and that's certainly the case in war-torn Libya. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo9WInCIA4I&t=46.0s)]
*  Yemen is another fragmented state case in the region. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo9WInCIA4I&t=59.0s)]
*  The Houthis controlled most of the north, and they can force their decisions if they want to close and shut down the mosques. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo9WInCIA4I&t=64.0s)]
*  But they decided that there is no corona cases in Yemen, so they should not take any procedures against corona. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo9WInCIA4I&t=82.0s)]
*  The same thing goes to the Salafis. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo9WInCIA4I&t=90.0s)]
*  Also, in the government areas, the government can't control these areas. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo9WInCIA4I&t=94.0s)]
*  They didn't control it very well. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo9WInCIA4I&t=100.0s)]
*  But in Aden, where the S.T.C., the Southern Transitional Council, controlled, they closed parties to some of the mosques since a month ago. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo9WInCIA4I&t=103.0s)]
*  But the mosques resume its work normally since Ramadan starts. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo9WInCIA4I&t=113.0s)]
*  So most of the warring parties in Yemen agreed that they don't need to take any measures against corona. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo9WInCIA4I&t=119.0s)]
