# Legacy and Lessons of The Arab Spring at 10: A Conversation in Honor of Malcolm Kerr
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [October 19, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg)
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Bill Burns, the president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and I'm [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=5.2s)]
*  delighted to welcome all of you to Carnegie, at least virtually, for a very special program. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=9.84s)]
*  I'm deeply honored today to celebrate the memory of Malcolm Kerr, the extraordinary [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=15.6s)]
*  American scholar of the Middle East, whose life was tragically cut short three and a [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=20.6s)]
*  half decades ago while serving as president of the American University of Beirut and to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=25.84s)]
*  announce the renaming of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut in his honor. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=30.96s)]
*  And I'm also proud to introduce a timely conversation a little later in the program [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=36.32s)]
*  among a terrific group of panelists about the future of the Middle East, nearly a decade [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=41.08s)]
*  after the dramatic events of the Arab Spring. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=46.64s)]
*  Across the vast, storied and often turbulent history of Americans in the Middle East, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=49.84s)]
*  Malcolm Kerr stands out in many ways, although not in Arab himself. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=55.52s)]
*  He truly was a son of the region, raised in Beirut, a brilliant student and prolific [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  scholar of the Middle East, dispassionate in his diagnosis of the region's dysfunctions, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=65.36s)]
*  as well as the magical thinking and hubris of American policymakers and other outsiders, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=71.12s)]
*  but a passionate believer in the promise and potential of the people of the region [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=76.84s)]
*  and a remarkably dedicated supporter of the next generation of Arab thinkers and practitioners. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=81.88000000000001s)]
*  Kerr had few illusions about the region's many big personalities, big ideas, big gambles [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  and even bigger setbacks. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=94.36s)]
*  Better than most, he understood the importance of rooting the region's future in its own [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=96.4s)]
*  people. Kerr wrote in his seminal 1965 book, The Arab Cold War, that to grasp the spirit [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=101.4s)]
*  of the Arab's political life, we must recognize that their society, for all its crises, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=109.0s)]
*  possesses its own vitality. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=114.44s)]
*  Even the most influential foreigners are peripheral to the Arab's own conceptions of their [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=116.68s)]
*  world and their visions of its future. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=122.24s)]
*  Malcolm Kerr's grasp of the region in all its complexities shines through as clearly [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=125.2s)]
*  today as it did in his writings more than a half a century ago. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=130.36s)]
*  He would not find the state of today's Middle East anymore uplifting. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=134.32000000000002s)]
*  The profound failures of governance that he observed so sharply in the 20th century [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=138.56s)]
*  finally boiled over during the Arab Spring in the 21st, producing an unsettling mix of [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=143.96s)]
*  hope, chaos and conservative reaction. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  A decade later, the politics of the Arab world remain brittle. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  Relations among many of its governments are broken or frayed, with too many of them [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=157.28s)]
*  doing too much reckless meddling in the affairs of too many others. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=162.2s)]
*  Much as was the case when Kerr wrote The Arab Cold War, this creates a target-rich [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=166.76s)]
*  environment for too many opportunistic outsiders and predators of all stripes. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile, too many people in too many societies in the region remain mired in a sense [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=177.39999999999998s)]
*  of indignity, frustrated and angered by growing gaps between rich and poor, suffocating [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=183.92s)]
*  social and political environments and venal and incompetent governance. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=190.23999999999998s)]
*  Malcolm Kerr's work may be unfinished, but his legacy is more relevant and important [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=194.95999999999998s)]
*  than ever. In a world of quiet Americans and ugly Americans, in a region which has [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=200.11999999999998s)]
*  sometimes seen American policymakers at their worst, Kerr represented America at its [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=205.76s)]
*  best. He offered another side of the American experience in the Middle East, committed [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=211.24s)]
*  to education, a model of human compassion, professional humility, intellectual honesty [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=217.52s)]
*  and generosity of spirit. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=223.84s)]
*  His was a life extraordinarily well lived, brutally ended far too soon in the war-torn [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=225.96s)]
*  city he loved. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=231.76000000000002s)]
*  It's entirely fitting to honor his memory all these years later by dedicating the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=233.44s)]
*  Carnegie Middle East Center in his name. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=238.4s)]
*  And it's entirely fitting to do so at yet another time of troubles in Lebanon in the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=240.76000000000002s)]
*  wake of the horrific explosion two months ago, which did so much physical damage across [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  Beirut, a city already reeling from years of political, social and economic damage. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=251.08s)]
*  Carnegie remains committed to our center in Beirut, established in 2007 as a rare place [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  in the Arab world where Arab scholars can think freely about their region and its [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  pathologies, a place in, by and for the Arab world, its analysis grounded in local [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  realities and ambitions, not what outsiders imagine. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=275.04s)]
*  Led by my exceptional colleagues, Maha Yahya, our director in Beirut, and Marwan [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=279.0s)]
*  Mawashir, our vice president for the Middle East, our center is the hub of a network of [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=283.92s)]
*  experts across the region. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=289.0s)]
*  It puts particular emphasis, as Malcolm Kerr did, on a next generation which can [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=291.32s)]
*  strengthen Carnegie's tradition of independent research and help chart a path to a [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=296.92s)]
*  more pluralistic, peaceful and prosperous future. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=302.28000000000003s)]
*  We also benefit enormously from the generous support of many people, in particular [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=306.0s)]
*  Carnegie trustees, Dave Burke and Iman Asfari, who share our dedication to this [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=310.8s)]
*  important work and our admiration for Malcolm Kerr. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=316.04s)]
*  Our aim is to help carry on his work and to continue to provide a public space for [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=319.68s)]
*  the next generation of Arabs to debate, discuss and write their own future. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=325.4s)]
*  It is a special honor to be joined today by Anne Kerr, whose own contributions to [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=330.44s)]
*  better understanding of the Middle East and whose own largeness of spirit are as [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=335.91999999999996s)]
*  impressive as her late husbands. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=340.76s)]
*  And it's an honor to be joined on this virtual platform by the next generations of [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=343.24s)]
*  the Kerr family, too, by Susan, John, Steve and Andrew, by grandchildren and other [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=348.08000000000004s)]
*  family members. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=353.16s)]
*  I want to also welcome those friends, colleagues and admirers of Malcolm Kerr [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=354.52000000000004s)]
*  from around the world who are able to join us today. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=359.20000000000005s)]
*  I hope you'll enjoy our program. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=362.12s)]
*  In a few minutes, we'll play a short video commemorating the new Malcolm Kerr [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=363.88s)]
*  Carnegie Middle East Center. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=368.32000000000005s)]
*  That'll be followed by remarks from Anne Kerr and Maha Yahya. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=369.96000000000004s)]
*  And then we'll have a panel discussion on the future of the region, moderated by the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=373.8s)]
*  incomparable Christiane Aminpour and including three friends and insightful [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=379.0s)]
*  observers, Jihad Azur, Mawaan Mawashir and Ben Rhodes. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=383.48s)]
*  So thank you all again for joining us on this memorable day. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=387.68s)]
*  To mark this moment, we've also reprinted a new edition of the Arab Cold War in [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=391.04s)]
*  partnership with Oxford University Press, which can be obtained through the Carnegie [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=396.24s)]
*  website. We hope very much to follow up. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=400.88s)]
*  This virtual event with in-person events at UCLA and in Beirut as soon as the [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=403.56s)]
*  pandemic finally permits. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=409.0s)]
*  In the meantime, I hope you enjoy the program and the video, which begins now. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=411.0s)]
*  Thank you again. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=415.48s)]
*  Today's Middle East has been shaped by powerful social, political and economic [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=422.0s)]
*  cards. Few people understood these volatile forces better than Malcolm H. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=426.2s)]
*  Born and raised in Beirut, the son of humanitarian volunteers who helped [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=433.8s)]
*  refugees fleeing the Armenian genocide. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=438.36s)]
*  He was passionately committed to the region where he lived for most of his life. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=441.16s)]
*  He grew up to be a distinguished professor of modern politics, spending many years in [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=445.72s)]
*  the Middle East with his wife and young family. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=451.0s)]
*  Eventually, he became president of the American University of Beirut, where his [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=454.20000000000005s)]
*  parents had once worked and where during the Lebanese Civil War, he was tragically [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=459.4s)]
*  assassinated in 1984. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=464.56s)]
*  Malcolm H. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=468.67999999999995s)]
*  Carr dedicated his life to working with the next generation of Arab thinkers and [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=469.4s)]
*  doers. He was a passionate believer and a promising potential of the people of the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=474.03999999999996s)]
*  Middle East. It is in this spirit that Carnegie Middle East Center is proudly [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=479.15999999999997s)]
*  renamed in his honor. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=484.28s)]
*  From the heart of Beirut to the rest of the world, the Malcolm H. Carr Carnegie Middle [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=485.96000000000004s)]
*  East Center will uplift Middle Eastern voices. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=490.56s)]
*  It will amplify the perspectives of regional scholars through their independent [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=494.20000000000005s)]
*  contributions to Carnegie's globally renowned research and analysis. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=498.44s)]
*  And it will support the next generation of multidisciplinary Arab scholars as they [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=504.16s)]
*  debate, discuss and write their own future. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=510.24s)]
*  Regionally grounded, globally connected, the Malcolm H. Carr Carnegie Middle East [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=514.6s)]
*  Center. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=519.96s)]
*  Hello, everyone. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=533.32s)]
*  It's wonderful to see this great commemoration for Malcolm and the Carnegie Center [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=534.6800000000001s)]
*  in Beirut being named after him. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=542.04s)]
*  We were, some of my children and I have actually been to visit the center on two [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=544.9599999999999s)]
*  different occasions and we're extremely impressed with the work you're doing. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=551.48s)]
*  I'd like to name my children because we're all here today in at a distance and they [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=558.1999999999999s)]
*  couldn't they can't be on this screen with me. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=565.24s)]
*  But my four children, Susan, John, Steve and Andrew, the children of Malcolm and me, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=567.4399999999999s)]
*  feel this very much this the pride in what's being done today. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=575.76s)]
*  And everyone wants to be there in person before too long. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=579.76s)]
*  We hope that will happen. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=585.04s)]
*  I'd like to say how much it would mean to Malcolm. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=587.36s)]
*  I can hardly imagine. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=590.16s)]
*  Thirty seven years ago, he was killed. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=591.88s)]
*  And it's been a long, long time, but somehow. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=595.5999999999999s)]
*  We've been able to do positive things in his memory. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=602.7199999999999s)]
*  There are many scholarships in his name. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=607.4s)]
*  Many different books have been written, prizes made for the best thesis, PhD thesis [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=611.9599999999999s)]
*  at Mesa, and all these things have carried on his memory. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=621.2s)]
*  And I feel my children have have been living examples of what he would believe in. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=626.32s)]
*  Thank goodness it turned out pretty nicely and he would be very proud of them. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=634.1600000000001s)]
*  His grandchildren, our grandchildren are also watching today and they did not know [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=639.72s)]
*  their their grandfather, nor he them. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=645.5200000000001s)]
*  So today is an opportunity for them to know also this whole aspect of our lives in the Middle East. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=648.64s)]
*  I'm very grateful to you. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=655.9599999999999s)]
*  And I'm also grateful that the Arab Cold War is being republished and so tied in with what's [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=657.9599999999999s)]
*  going on today, which we'll hear about later, and that Marwan and Bill, Bill Burns and Marwan [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=668.4s)]
*  Masher have written forwards to the book, which will bring it especially up to date. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=676.32s)]
*  And we'll be very proud. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=681.7600000000001s)]
*  We thanks. Thank you all. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=684.8000000000001s)]
*  And Maha, you're next, I think. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=686.6400000000001s)]
*  Thank you for all you do. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=690.6800000000001s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you, Anne. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=697.6800000000001s)]
*  Thank you, Anne and Bill. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=701.32s)]
*  And the truly civilized man is barked by empathy. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=702.92s)]
*  Malcolm Kerr wrote and forward to a collection of essays called The Arab Israeli [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=707.7199999999999s)]
*  Confrontation of June 1967, an Arab perspective, by his recognition that the thought and [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=711.8399999999999s)]
*  understanding of men of other cultures may differ sharply from his own, that what seems [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=719.8399999999999s)]
*  natural to him may appear grotesque to others. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=725.04s)]
*  These are Malcolm's words. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=728.28s)]
*  These words were not simple rhetoric, but a profound belief that ran through Malcolm Kerr [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=730.12s)]
*  and his family, especially his wife, Anne. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=735.28s)]
*  Kerr needs no introduction to a Middle Eastern and more so to a Lebanese audience. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=738.92s)]
*  As Bill pointed out, he was born in Beirut and was a student of this region and a believer [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=743.8s)]
*  in the potential of his societies. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=749.04s)]
*  In his work, he shied away from dichotomies and strove to bring to light the realities of [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=751.36s)]
*  this region for audiences, both in the East and the West. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=757.56s)]
*  In doing so, he sought to build bridges of understanding across cultures and war [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=762.28s)]
*  friendships with those near and far. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=767.3599999999999s)]
*  On a very personal note, the man in the photograph with Malcolm Kerr at the American [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=770.28s)]
*  University of Beirut is my very own uncle, Adnan Brouie, who shared Malcolm's belief [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=775.5999999999999s)]
*  in the plurality of cultures and was dedicated his life to serving this university [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=781.88s)]
*  and this country. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=787.4s)]
*  For me, this makes the ceremony of renaming our center even more personal and more emotional. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=788.92s)]
*  Malcolm's own personal history was also deeply intertwined with that of this region. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=795.6800000000001s)]
*  His own parents, Elsa and Stanley Kerr, volunteered as part of the American Near East [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=801.16s)]
*  Relief in Turkey during World War One to care for the thousands of Armenians in Syria and [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=806.0s)]
*  then in Lebanon. They also saved thousands from being massacred at the hands of [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=811.92s)]
*  Ottoman forces during that period. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=816.88s)]
*  In this spirit, Malcolm Kerr came back to Beirut in 1983 with his wife, Anne, to become [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=819.72s)]
*  president of the American University of Beirut, where he and his parents have taught. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=825.4s)]
*  It was a decision that would have tragic consequences when he was assassinated in January [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=830.56s)]
*  1984 just outside his office. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=835.92s)]
*  Yet even after such a tragedy, his wife, Anne, maintained and upheld their commitment to [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=839.36s)]
*  the American University and to the region. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=846.16s)]
*  For Carnegie, it is only fitting that we rename the Beirut Center in honor of Malcolm [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=849.52s)]
*  Kerr. Our work at the center carries on in his legacy of hosting debates and discussion [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=855.3199999999999s)]
*  in a region where the space for civil dialogue is closing quickly. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=861.24s)]
*  Our research, conducted by scholars, as Bill pointed out, from the region rests on [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=866.3199999999999s)]
*  providing a nuanced understanding of the complexities of our region and in the process [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=871.76s)]
*  helping to build a more empathetic understanding of its societies. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=876.84s)]
*  In 1984, a son of Beirut would die in the city of his birth. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=881.8000000000001s)]
*  We at Carnegie hope that by renaming the Middle East Center in his name, we can contribute [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=886.84s)]
*  to keeping alive the memory of Malcolm Kerr and helping to revitalize the values that [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=892.0s)]
*  he so powerfully embodied. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=896.9200000000001s)]
*  Thank you. I'm now going to hand it over to the formidable Christiane Amanpour for to [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=899.48s)]
*  manage the for the next session of the debate. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=905.84s)]
*  Thank you. OK, that's great. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=909.6s)]
*  It's great to hear from you, Maha, Anne, Marwan, Bill, Ben, Jihad, all the people who [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=912.0400000000001s)]
*  are on this panel. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=918.36s)]
*  Look, I just want to say that I'm so happy to be doing this. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=920.32s)]
*  Malcolm Kerr's name really had a huge impact on me. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=923.0400000000001s)]
*  I was a desk assistant at the foreign desk at CNN. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=926.8399999999999s)]
*  I just joined CNN three months earlier when Malcolm Kerr was assassinated. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=929.3199999999999s)]
*  And my job was to bring in all the video and all the reporters, scripts and information [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=934.0s)]
*  from Beirut during those terribly turbulent times. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=939.76s)]
*  So his name has been imprinted on me and my understanding of that region ever since [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=942.52s)]
*  those turbulent and tragic times. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=949.0s)]
*  I was so moved by Anne Kerr and her interview that she gave in the wonderful series [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=951.52s)]
*  The Last Dance. And I just feel this sort of I don't know, kinship with your family, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=957.04s)]
*  because even Steve Kerr, I used to watch live in Atlanta and also in New York when I [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=962.9599999999999s)]
*  moved to New York for CNN, playing for the Bulls. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=968.76s)]
*  So I just feel that this is the stars are aligned. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=971.4s)]
*  I'm so happy to be able to be a small part of today. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=974.04s)]
*  Plus, I am from that region and it's endlessly interesting and without a solution, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=977.44s)]
*  the world will not be stable. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=983.72s)]
*  So I want to ask you, Marwan, first, you know, and Kerr wrote, as we know, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=985.48s)]
*  The Arab Cold War. He was he had this idea that the Arab world, either politically or [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=990.8s)]
*  economically, you know, wouldn't really succeed if the Arab world wasn't unified and [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=997.92s)]
*  each went off on their own tale of self-aggrandizement. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1004.4s)]
*  And he was very critical of how they spent the oil money, what happened during the 70s [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1008.16s)]
*  and the oil boom, which also affected my country, Iran. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1014.32s)]
*  And I'm really interested to know what you think about wither the Arab world. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1018.2s)]
*  Everybody thought that the Arab Spring of 2010, 2011 was going to be a permanent shift [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1023.16s)]
*  to match people's desire for democracy and freedom and independence. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1029.1200000000001s)]
*  Give us your sort of citriot, Marwan, of where your part of the world is and the part of the world [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1035.64s)]
*  that Malcolm gave his life for. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1040.84s)]
*  Thank you, Christian. It's really an honor to be among this group and to honor Malcolm in this way. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1044.04s)]
*  Malcolm was one of the people who wrote sympathetically, but critically about the region. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1050.04s)]
*  And he wrote about the political order, which placed more importance on personalities [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1055.12s)]
*  rather than on countries and on development. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1060.52s)]
*  He also wrote about an economic order which used oil many times for useless projects, as he said. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1063.48s)]
*  We are witnessing now the crumbling of both these orders, the political and the economic order. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1072.1999999999998s)]
*  At least since the Arab Spring, the political order has crumbled in the Arab world. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1078.8s)]
*  The lack of attention to good governance has resulted in massive protests [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1083.88s)]
*  and sometimes changes of regimes in several Arab countries. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1090.3200000000002s)]
*  And in 2014, I think Jihad will talk more about that. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1094.1200000000001s)]
*  We have witnessed the start of the decline of oil prices and with it the end of rentierism in the Arab world, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1097.68s)]
*  the end of patronage systems in the Arab world. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1103.6000000000001s)]
*  COVID-19, of course, has come to deepen these crises, not to start them. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1107.96s)]
*  But in many ways, I feel that the work that we do at Carnegie is carrying on what Malcolm Kerr wrote about. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1114.2s)]
*  We are in a situation, in a phase where the old Arab order has crumbled politically and economically, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1123.2800000000002s)]
*  but there is no new order coming in its place. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1131.3600000000001s)]
*  The Arab world so far largely has refused to acknowledge that the old order has died, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1134.52s)]
*  that the old tools it used, the carrot and the stick, I say, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1141.8000000000002s)]
*  the carrot of financial resources and the stick of security services are crumbling. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1145.88s)]
*  And the Arab world refuses to acknowledge that these tools have to be replaced by inclusive decision making, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1151.16s)]
*  by moving from patronage to productivity, by educational systems that prepare people to deal with the complexities of life [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1159.5200000000002s)]
*  and by nurturing pluralism, respecting the diversity of the Arab world [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1170.2s)]
*  and understanding that it should be a source of strength and not weakness. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1175.24s)]
*  Unfortunately, not two countries have adopted these tools today, with the exception of Tunisia, probably in the Arab world. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1179.28s)]
*  We are seeing today authoritarianism being re-entrenching in most Arab countries [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1189.24s)]
*  and authoritarian systems really cementing their rule on power. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1198.6s)]
*  But I will say this, Christian, this is temporary. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1205.08s)]
*  This is the last hurrah. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1208.52s)]
*  This is the last hurrah. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1210.4399999999998s)]
*  People are not going to bring the clock back. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1211.56s)]
*  And yes, it is true that the Arab Spring has not fulfilled its full promise, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1216.0s)]
*  but I maintain it cannot do this in a short 10 years. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1221.24s)]
*  We are undergoing a huge transformation in the Arab world, a transformation that will take decades, if not more. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1225.4399999999998s)]
*  But the clock has started. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1233.3999999999999s)]
*  And I think that with this new generation, people are no longer willing to accept what their parents lived by. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1235.1599999999999s)]
*  They are no longer willing to accept the lack of attention to good governance, which remains the main problem in the Arab world today. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1243.6s)]
*  Marwan, I really hope from your voice to God's ears, I really hope this is the last hurrah. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1252.04s)]
*  I feel like we've heard this before. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1257.6s)]
*  And I'm worried about what you say is there is a trend towards authoritarianism. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1259.6s)]
*  Just look at... [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1264.44s)]
*  OK, we can discuss that Saudi Arabia, I mean, you know, speaking reform while putting reformers in jail, not to mention [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1265.72s)]
*  the terrible, terrible assassination of our own colleague, Jamal Khashoggi. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1274.8s)]
*  So I wonder where the reform is coming. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1279.52s)]
*  I agree with you that Tunisia is an example that we should all really, really study because it's incredible what they've done. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1281.32s)]
*  Right to the point also of literally throwing off the mantle and separating themselves from religious Islam and political Islam. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1288.76s)]
*  I find that very, very interesting. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1297.6s)]
*  Jihad Azou, I want to ask you because this comes to the heart of it. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1300.44s)]
*  Of course, you are a very well known economist at the IMF and you've done a huge amount of work. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1304.4s)]
*  I always have in my head the conclusions of several years. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1309.36s)]
*  I think it was in 2005, 2006 of UNDP reports that said of all regions of the world, there probably wasn't a bigger region of both natural and human resources than the Arab world. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1316.1599999999999s)]
*  Natural resources and human resources. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1329.4399999999998s)]
*  And yet it was still one that was not able to perform, you know, its political transformation, its education transformation. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1331.56s)]
*  It wasn't able to really burst out like Asia had done. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1343.24s)]
*  So I just want to ask you, what should be the economic priorities of that region? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1346.96s)]
*  And are you also confident in what Marwan said, that this is the last hurrah? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1351.84s)]
*  Christian, thank you for having me. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1357.0s)]
*  And also I'm greatly honored to be in this group of excellent thinkers to commemorate someone who brought a lot to the region. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1359.04s)]
*  You are asking a very difficult question and maybe here you will hear me echoing what Marwan has said. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1369.92s)]
*  OK, we are 10 years now since the outbreak of the Arab Spring and we're talking about legacies. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1375.12s)]
*  I think on the pluses, what we see is the aspiration for change is still there, especially at the youth level. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1383.2s)]
*  What also on the pluses, we see that the young generation is also ready to go on the street in order to see change happening. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1392.44s)]
*  The third plus is the recognition that politics cannot do it alone and transformation is broader than only politics and the politics dominance. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1400.8400000000001s)]
*  That was the curse of the region for decades, not taking into considerations economic issues, aspirational social issues. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1411.0s)]
*  I think we have shifted whereby now we discuss more political transformation, economic and social transformation. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1420.08s)]
*  On the negative, growth and inclusion indicators have not improved over the last 10 years. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1429.68s)]
*  At the contrary, they have deteriorated. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1436.48s)]
*  First decade of this century, we used to grow at five and a half percent on average. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1438.9199999999998s)]
*  Now we're growing at three and a half at best. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1443.6399999999999s)]
*  And there are countries where the level of despair has reached the situation that we're not seeing in a century. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1447.4799999999998s)]
*  We are at a crossroads. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1457.76s)]
*  This COVID-19 crisis is a crisis like no other. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1460.1999999999998s)]
*  It has combined all the problems and has exacerbated all the issues. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1464.12s)]
*  But also, I think it's a transformative moment whereby we need to focus on building a new social contract. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1468.3999999999999s)]
*  What does it mean? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1475.4399999999998s)]
*  It means that policies have to regain the territory on top of politics. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1476.76s)]
*  That transformation is a process. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1482.8799999999999s)]
*  It's not a series of actions that participation is right. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1485.24s)]
*  It's not something that the regime gives to people. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1491.9199999999998s)]
*  And last but not least, I think we have a population that 60 percent of it is below 30. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1495.68s)]
*  Well-educated relatively. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1501.28s)]
*  And a situation where in the face of one of the most challenging pandemic, the region held together. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1503.6000000000001s)]
*  I think this is where we need to look forward and see what is next. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1511.64s)]
*  What is next could be good and also could be bad because we could not retrieve the level of economic [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1516.96s)]
*  development that we have before the COVID-19 crisis in 10 years if we don't do the right reforms. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1524.0s)]
*  Also, we could face a situation where already the level of despair could be exacerbated because the Arab [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1531.12s)]
*  youths are thinking of leaving or going on the street, which is not the best way to change. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1539.36s)]
*  But I believe in the power of mind. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1547.6s)]
*  And this is why a meeting like this honoring a person like Malcolm Kerr is the right way of changing. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1550.8799999999999s)]
*  The change will not come in one step or even in one decade. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1561.28s)]
*  But the search for change is what we all are aspiring to. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1566.28s)]
*  And this is what you, Marwan and others are working to achieve. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1571.6799999999998s)]
*  It's really interesting and important. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1576.48s)]
*  I want to go to Ben Rhodes now. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1578.8s)]
*  You had obviously a front row seat. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1580.8s)]
*  You were in the foreign policy establishment during the Obama administration and you had your own [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1582.72s)]
*  challenges. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1587.72s)]
*  The offspring unfolded on your watch. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1588.44s)]
*  I think there was a lot of hope and then there was a lot of disappointment at the way it turned out. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1590.76s)]
*  And now we've seen just a completely different attitude from the Trump administration. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1595.1200000000001s)]
*  There's more transactional. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1602.76s)]
*  That is less sentimental, less values driven and more sort of they say strategically. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1604.24s)]
*  What do you think is the role, the correct role for the United States right now? [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1611.8s)]
*  Because the Trump administration will promote what it believes is important. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1616.64s)]
*  And I'd like to get everybody's idea on this. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1621.6000000000001s)]
*  Israel being able to normalize relations with the UAE and Bahrain, they hope for more, maybe one day [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1624.04s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, I don't know. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1631.04s)]
*  And all of this is about Iran. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1632.8799999999999s)]
*  But you're still left with the greater Arab world with, as Jihad said, this massively young [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1634.8799999999999s)]
*  population that wants better and more. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1640.32s)]
*  What will the U.S. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1642.6399999999999s)]
*  and should the U.S. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1644.08s)]
*  do going forward? [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1645.08s)]
*  Thanks, Chris John. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1647.08s)]
*  And you and I have talked a lot about this over the years. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1648.08s)]
*  And I'll keep this at an elevated level because we could go on forever. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1650.28s)]
*  I will say my frustrations when I left the United States, I was very upset about the U.S. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1655.08s)]
*  and I look back in particular about the Obama administration's response to the Arab Spring, is [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1661.0s)]
*  we got kind of caught halfway. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1666.0s)]
*  We wanted to embrace it. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1668.0s)]
*  We embraced obviously the initial movements for democracy in Tunisia and Egypt. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1670.0s)]
*  But in my view, we never really followed through on that because we had a government itself that [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1676.0s)]
*  was hardwired to see the Middle East as a threat and to see people in the Middle East as a threat. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1682.0s)]
*  And I think that's why I think it's so important for us as a country to be able to build a multi-trillion [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1688.08s)]
*  dollar post-9-11 counter-terrorism apparatus that in my mind, looking back with the perspective of [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1693.08s)]
*  20 years as a New Yorker who was there in 9-11, is crazy. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1699.08s)]
*  You know, the totality of our securitization of our approach to the Middle East kind of made it [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1703.08s)]
*  impossible for us in the Obama administration to fully embrace, I think in a way that President [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1711.08s)]
*  Trump was not able to do. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1716.1599999999999s)]
*  And I think our partners sensed that. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1718.1599999999999s)]
*  And ironically, it was Saudi Arabia and the UAE who basically helped finance the efforts to install [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1720.1599999999999s)]
*  General Sisi in Egypt and kind of fueled a counterrevolutionary trend across the region that [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1726.1599999999999s)]
*  sought to reassert authoritarianism. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1732.1599999999999s)]
*  We were obviously trying to break that mindset in a number of ways, including through the [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1734.1599999999999s)]
*  diplomacy with Iran. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1740.1599999999999s)]
*  The onset of the Trump presidency, you saw a kind of full embrace of the authoritarian trend in the [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1742.24s)]
*  region and the idea that the way that the U.S. deals with this region is to deal with men like [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1748.24s)]
*  Mohammed bin Salman. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1752.24s)]
*  And that frankly is not so out of step. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1754.24s)]
*  I mean, I've heard people describe Trump as unconventional. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1756.24s)]
*  It's actually a remarkably conventional approach to the Middle East. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1759.24s)]
*  It's one that prioritizes oil wealth and terrorism and doesn't see the people of the region. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1762.24s)]
*  And so to me, I mean, I'll end on this point. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1770.32s)]
*  I think America needs to change its mindset here and see the people of the region as the solution [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1772.32s)]
*  to the problems of the region and not whatever authoritarian leader is in particular favor in [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1778.32s)]
*  Washington at a given moment. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1784.32s)]
*  That's why the Malcolm Kerr legacy is so important. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1786.32s)]
*  Because of that human capacity in the region, America has to in many ways get out of its own [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1788.32s)]
*  way in this region. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1794.32s)]
*  And I would like to see us begin to desecuritize not just our post-911 wars, but as you wind down [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1796.3999999999999s)]
*  those wars, how do you develop relationships here that again see and elevate the promise of the [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1802.3999999999999s)]
*  people? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1810.3999999999999s)]
*  Because I agree with what's been said. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1812.3999999999999s)]
*  The Arab Spring is 10 years old, but these things are going to play out for 20, 30 more years. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1814.3999999999999s)]
*  The corruption is not going away. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1820.3999999999999s)]
*  The frustration of young people is not going away. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1822.3999999999999s)]
*  We've seen movements in Algeria and Sudan just in the last year in this part of the world. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1824.48s)]
*  This is going to keep happening until there is a capacity to have governance that is responsive [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1828.48s)]
*  to the people of the region. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1834.48s)]
*  And as much as we welcome normalization deals between Bahrain and the UAE and Israel, that's [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1836.48s)]
*  not going to achieve that. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1842.48s)]
*  That is about politics and geopolitics. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1844.48s)]
*  But ultimately, this has to be about the politics of countries. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1848.48s)]
*  And I hope that the U.S., if we can unwind ourselves from the kind of forever war we've [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1852.56s)]
*  been fighting, if we can speak with principle inconsistency about our values and prioritize [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1858.56s)]
*  our values over some of the transactional relationships that we have in the region, can [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1864.56s)]
*  begin to play a constructive role in forming policies that are informed by the people of the [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1868.56s)]
*  region. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1876.56s)]
*  And frankly, by the kind of approach that Malcolm Kerr took to these issues. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1878.6399999999999s)]
*  That's really fascinating because it's rare to hear an American official former talk about [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1882.6399999999999s)]
*  prioritizing the people. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1890.6399999999999s)]
*  Everybody pays lip service to it, but it generally deals with the leaders. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1892.6399999999999s)]
*  So I'm going to do one more round of questions with you gentlemen, and then I want to open it [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1896.6399999999999s)]
*  up for questions from those who are on board here. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1900.6399999999999s)]
*  Marwan, you are not just vice president of the Middle East sector, but you used to be [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1904.72s)]
*  former minister of Jordan, a country that used to do, is an ally of the United States. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1908.72s)]
*  Is it realistic with the Jordanian system, I'm not going to put my finger on people, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1914.72s)]
*  appreciate America actually doing the right thing and trying to do what the people of [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1920.72s)]
*  Jordan or Egypt or Saudi Arabia or elsewhere would want, or would Jordan and any other [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1928.8s)]
*  country sort of say, hey, you're talking to me? [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1934.8s)]
*  Christian, the United States is an ally of Jordan, but its record of intervention in the [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1938.8s)]
*  Middle East has not been a particularly good one. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1946.8s)]
*  I can point out to the Iraq war, I can point out to the Arab-Israeli conflict, I can point out [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1948.8s)]
*  to many instances where the intervention has not really been positive, frankly. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1954.8799999999999s)]
*  Malcolm Kerr said something very important, and he said it more than half a decade ago. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1960.8799999999999s)]
*  Bill alluded to it, which is that foreign intervention remains peripheral to the needs [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1964.8799999999999s)]
*  and aspirations of the region. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1970.8799999999999s)]
*  And the region is the only, the people of the region are the only ones that can carry [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1972.8799999999999s)]
*  this forward. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1978.8799999999999s)]
*  Intervention by the United States or by any other foreign power is really not going to [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1980.96s)]
*  help, except in maybe niche places. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1986.96s)]
*  Malcolm Kerr and the American University of Beirut represents the best intervention that [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1992.96s)]
*  America has done in the region for peanuts money. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=1998.96s)]
*  This is an institution that has been in the region for the last 20 years. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2002.96s)]
*  It has been in the region for the last 150 years, teaching liberal values, teaching [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2009.04s)]
*  respect for diversity, critical thinking, skills and values that are today essential [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2015.04s)]
*  if the Arab world is to transition to more pluralistic and prosperous societies. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2023.04s)]
*  This is the kind of intervention, if there is to be one, that we need in the region. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2029.04s)]
*  The last intervention with the Trump plan, frankly, Christian, is a joke. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2035.12s)]
*  You know, it gives Israel everything it wants. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2041.12s)]
*  It calls for a two-state solution when what it really is calling for is a Bandistan type [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2045.12s)]
*  of an arrangement for the Palestinians, surrounded on all sides by Israel. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2051.12s)]
*  And even the normalization deals with Bahrain and the Emirates. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2055.12s)]
*  I mean, on the surface, who is against normalization, right? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2059.12s)]
*  But in reality, these deals are giving Israel the excuse that it does not have to come to [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2063.2s)]
*  terms with the Palestinians who are living amongst them and instead can normalize with [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2071.2s)]
*  the rest of the Arab world for no cost. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2077.2s)]
*  These deals, in my view, are killing the two-state solution. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2079.2s)]
*  The very objective that the signatories to the deal and the international community want [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2085.2799999999997s)]
*  to achieve. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2092.48s)]
*  And if the two-state solution is killed, then the prospects for peace in the Middle East [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2093.68s)]
*  are going to be very gloomy, I'm afraid. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2099.2799999999997s)]
*  OK, so let me ask you, Jihad, to expand on that, because Malcolm Kerr talked about, you [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2103.2799999999997s)]
*  know, pan-Arab unity at the expense of each one's self-aggrandization. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2111.36s)]
*  You could say these deals have cut all the way through that. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2115.36s)]
*  There's no pan-Arab unity in what UAE or Bahrain did, excluding the Palestinians from this [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2119.36s)]
*  deal with Israel. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2126.1600000000003s)]
*  There's that. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2128.1600000000003s)]
*  That's a comment. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2130.1600000000003s)]
*  The question is, does it matter these days? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2132.1600000000003s)]
*  Marwan says it matters. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2134.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm excited that the Palestinian question is secondary. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2137.04s)]
*  Can the Arab world emerge in the way Malcolm envisioned, in the way we're talking about, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2143.04s)]
*  unless that, if that crisis is not solved? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2149.04s)]
*  Well, a few comments. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2153.04s)]
*  One, there is a value in cooperation, and I would say there is a value in partnership. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2157.04s)]
*  When you take the example of Maghreb countries and you see the inter-trade between those [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2161.92s)]
*  countries is the lowest integrated region in the world. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2165.92s)]
*  Only by improving this and reducing some of the barriers, you can create on a yearly basis [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2169.92s)]
*  one to one and a half additional growth and create millions of jobs. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2175.92s)]
*  Therefore, there is great value of removing their barriers, developing partnerships. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2181.92s)]
*  I would say that the Arab world is not a place to be, not using the old model of the Arab [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2186.8s)]
*  League of the 40s, but there's definitely something to build here. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2190.8s)]
*  The issue of inclusion is at the heart of any transformation that one should look at. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2194.8s)]
*  You cannot build the modern society in the region where women participation is as low [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2200.8s)]
*  as it is today, one of the lowest worldwide. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2206.8s)]
*  You cannot address the future with confidence if the level of unemployment at youth is on [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2208.8s)]
*  the rise. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2215.6800000000003s)]
*  Therefore, those are facts, and those facts are strong, and you need to address them. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2217.6800000000003s)]
*  Any model or any plan for revival at the regional level should put these elements into the center [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2221.6800000000003s)]
*  stage of any agenda for the future. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2229.6800000000003s)]
*  Also, the issue of accountability is something that has to tackle the issue of governance [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2233.6800000000003s)]
*  and fighting corruption. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2239.6800000000003s)]
*  This is one of the most challenging issues that is widening the gap between citizens [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2242.56s)]
*  and the state. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2252.56s)]
*  If we don't bring those two together, it's very difficult to think of the future. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2254.56s)]
*  Of course, we are in a region where interference has accelerated, prevented, or diverged [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2258.56s)]
*  from the United States, from other forces, who maybe converge on the need for change [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2267.44s)]
*  and diverge on the way change should take place. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2277.44s)]
*  I think we are today at also one of the crossroads, because this COVID-19 shock is about disruption [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2281.44s)]
*  and acceleration. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2289.44s)]
*  There is a disruption of certain activities and patterns that this crisis has made obsolete [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2292.32s)]
*  and acceleration of certain trends. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2298.32s)]
*  Technology, for example, is playing an important role. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2300.32s)]
*  More than five million people were provided access to support in Morocco, for example, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2302.32s)]
*  through mobile phones. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2308.32s)]
*  Technology today is playing an important role in fighting the pandemic, and it could play [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2310.32s)]
*  an important role in the future. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2316.32s)]
*  We need to look at the legacy of the last 10 years with a surgical view and look at [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2319.2000000000003s)]
*  the lessons, but I think it's a long-term play, and this play requires to look at the [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2327.2000000000003s)]
*  foundations of the social contract that countries need to redesign and the region need to agree [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2333.2000000000003s)]
*  on. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2339.2000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2342.08s)]
*  I think, Ben, I'm going to ask you a question that actually popped up on the notes here. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2344.08s)]
*  Basam Al-Kuwaiti, this is a comment, he said the two-state solution is not feasible anymore. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2350.08s)]
*  So your comment on that. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2356.08s)]
*  And also, I want to ask you, you see the U.S. pulling back. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2358.08s)]
*  You see President Trump wanting to bring troops home from whether it's Afghanistan or other [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2362.08s)]
*  parts of the Middle East. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2366.08s)]
*  So if you could just answer the question about the two-state solution, whether the United [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2368.96s)]
*  States believes that it is still the basis of the policy there, and what's the good and [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2372.96s)]
*  the bad about bringing American troops back? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2378.96s)]
*  Sure. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2382.96s)]
*  I certainly believe in the two-state solution, but I think that the actions of the United [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2384.96s)]
*  States seem to suggest that, certainly in the Trump administration, their approach is [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2390.0s)]
*  that the Israelis dictate the terms of Palestinian surrender and that there's certainly not going [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2396.96s)]
*  to be a two-state solution any time soon, if ever. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2402.96s)]
*  And I think the United States needs to determine at some point whether or not two-state solution [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2406.96s)]
*  is just a talking point that politicians use and frankly foreign policy experts use to [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2410.96s)]
*  get through difficult conversations because the actions of the U.S. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2416.96s)]
*  government in support of the Israeli government with the kind of seniority of the Israeli [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2420.96s)]
*  government, with the kind of ceaseless expansion of settlements, is rendering the two-state [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2425.92s)]
*  solution almost impossible right now. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2431.92s)]
*  And so for the U.S. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2433.92s)]
*  government, I think the point is going to be, do we stand behind that position internationally [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2435.92s)]
*  and diplomatically, which I think we should? [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2439.92s)]
*  And we did at the very end of the Obama administration, a UN Security Council resolution that we abstained [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2441.92s)]
*  from, because frankly, again, as someone who believes strongly in a Jewish state that is [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2447.92s)]
*  secure in the region, I don't know how Israel continues to be both a democracy and a Jewish [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2454.88s)]
*  state absent a two-state solution unless they're going to somehow expel mass amounts of Palestinians [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2463.12s)]
*  from the West Bank. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2470.56s)]
*  So I think that this needs to continue to be a focus for the U.S., but I think it needs [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2472.08s)]
*  to be a position that the U.S. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2477.76s)]
*  frankly is willing to stand behind. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2479.92s)]
*  And I think the U.S. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2482.32s)]
*  has to recognize that the veneer of a quote unquote peace process has been part of what [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2483.92s)]
*  has allowed the situation to erode, because certainly Prime Minister Netanyahu knows how [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2489.68s)]
*  to use the veneer of a peace process to suggest that Israel is somehow open to a two-state [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2494.48s)]
*  solution when their actual policies are making it less and less likely, if not impossible. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2500.16s)]
*  So it's on life support now, and I'd like to see that not be the case, but that's the [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2505.36s)]
*  reality. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2510.8s)]
*  In terms of troops, look, there are almost 20,000 additional U.S. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2511.44s)]
*  troops in the Middle East from when President Trump took office. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2516.32s)]
*  So one of the biggest absurdities is this continued refrain that he has that he's bringing [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2519.92s)]
*  home troops in the Middle East. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2526.88s)]
*  I think he is committed to winding down the war on Afghanistan, but I think he's wildly [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2528.1600000000003s)]
*  out of step with his own military in that process, as we've seen recently. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2533.68s)]
*  And what he's basically done is treated the United States military like something of a [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2540.48s)]
*  mercenary force that can be summoned by the government of Saudi Arabia for its defense. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2545.68s)]
*  A large plus up of those troops came after Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear agreement, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2551.04s)]
*  after we saw the bombing of Saudi oil fields. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2556.64s)]
*  This is not the way in which the U.S. military should be used. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2559.7599999999998s)]
*  To me, yes, the troop question matters, but the question also matters is what kind of [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2562.88s)]
*  military function does the United States play in the region? [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2568.4s)]
*  And again, I would like to see us wind down our engagement to the maximum extent possible [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2572.56s)]
*  in the post-911 wars, but also shift the mentality to trying to resolve disputes through [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2580.88s)]
*  diplomacy in the region, which is what we were trying to do with the Iran nuclear agreement. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2585.92s)]
*  And then again, also realizing that the securitization of the region through our [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2590.32s)]
*  military presence has not brought about the stability that the Americans like to talk about. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2597.92s)]
*  And I just want to echo the point about Malcolm Kerr. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2604.32s)]
*  What we need is exchange programs. What we need is support for civil society. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2608.56s)]
*  What the United States needs to be doing is setting a democratic example. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2612.08s)]
*  That ultimately is going to be much more powerful and alluring, I think, to the people of the region [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2616.88s)]
*  than our military presence. And I think that this is something that people talk about, but really [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2622.48s)]
*  requires a fundamental shift in mindset here, because I don't think anybody can look at the [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2632.6400000000003s)]
*  return on our military interventions in the region and think that they've been at all positive, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2638.8s)]
*  that they've achieved even the objectives we set for them. And I think there has to be a willingness [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2643.36s)]
*  to question those basic assumptions. The last thing I want to say about this is people say, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2649.6800000000003s)]
*  well, you're going to give the region to Russia or something, as if it's ours to give. And as if [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2653.76s)]
*  we are controlling somehow the events inside of Middle Eastern countries, that is not the case. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2658.1600000000003s)]
*  What separates America from Russia? What separates America from China should be our democratic [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2665.04s)]
*  example, our open society. When I meet people from the region who admire America, they don't [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2670.72s)]
*  tend to hang that admiration on the presence of the Fifth Fleet in Bahrain or the Iraq War. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2676.64s)]
*  They admire things like the American University in Beirut. They admire our open society. They used [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2682.56s)]
*  to admire our open-est immigrants. They knew a cousin who studied in the United States. They [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2686.64s)]
*  themselves studied in the United States. This is the kind of effort we should be ramping up, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2690.48s)]
*  frankly, as we wind down military engagements, because it's hugely impactful and much less [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2695.04s)]
*  costly than what we've seen in terms of our military dimensions. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2701.12s)]
*  Thank you, Ben. Just to say we've got some really nice comments. Everybody very pleased to see that [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2708.0s)]
*  Malcolm Kerr's scholarly experiences being celebrated. That's really nice. Somebody here [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2712.8799999999997s)]
*  in Adair Hashemi says, I'm impressed by Ben Rhodes' honesty at admitting past mistakes, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2722.48s)]
*  and glad to see him admit that the U.S. must invest in the people of the Middle East, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2726.88s)]
*  not their despotic leaders. So there you go, Ben. You get a coup d'etat. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2730.48s)]
*  Marwan, Iran obviously is the big controversial country of the region. There's a couple of [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2736.6400000000003s)]
*  questions here about comment on the negative influences of Israel and Turkey. So we've talked [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2743.92s)]
*  a little bit about Israel. We haven't talked about Turkey. I want to ask you about Iran. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2749.6800000000003s)]
*  Jordan is no big fan of Iran. And yet, you know that, I mean, I think most, well, many people in [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2754.24s)]
*  the world and many governments appreciated the Iran nuclear deal for at least ratcheting down [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2764.0s)]
*  a major part of the danger. And we've said that Iran, like many Middle Eastern countries, has a [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2769.52s)]
*  massive young population, freedom, the ones tomorrow, educated, racing, and everything else. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2775.68s)]
*  What do you think is Iran's game plan right now? And conversely, what should [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2785.9199999999996s)]
*  the next president, Trump or Biden, do about Iran? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2792.56s)]
*  Iran is a major player in the region, often in negative terms. I think the Iranian nuclear deal [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2805.68s)]
*  under President Obama did a lot to at least slow down Iranian nuclear activity, Christian. What it [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2814.16s)]
*  did not do is to address Iran's intervention in the affairs of the Arab world. And this is its main [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2824.0s)]
*  criticism in the region, that you don't only look at the nuclear issue, that there are other issues [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2829.68s)]
*  in which Iran intervenes in the region that has not been addressed. This is what drives, for example, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2837.68s)]
*  Gulf states to sideline the Palestinian issue and cooperate with Israel against Iran. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2843.7599999999998s)]
*  My own view is that I think even though Iran is not an Arab country, we've kind of witnessed the [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2851.04s)]
*  first Arab Spring in Iran. We've witnessed it before we did in the Arab world in 2009. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2858.16s)]
*  It did not succeed, just as it did not succeed in many countries in the Arab world, but it does [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2865.12s)]
*  point out to the fact that in the end, the new generation is not going to accept, you know, rule [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2871.04s)]
*  in an authoritative way, whether that authoritarianism is coming from religious [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2879.2799999999997s)]
*  spheres or secular spheres as well. I want Christian just to mention also what Ben referred [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2884.0s)]
*  to in terms of the two-state solution, if I can. Ben said it's on life support. Let me go further. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2892.08s)]
*  It's dead. Okay. Let me remind all of us with what John Kerry said. He was the Secretary of State [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2898.8s)]
*  in the Obama administration. What he said in 2014, he said, we have one year or two years max [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2906.8s)]
*  before the two-state solution is that well, it's been six years. And I think that the international [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2914.48s)]
*  community, by giving passive support to a two-state solution without an active plan to make it happen [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2921.44s)]
*  is actually contributing to the death of the two-state solution because Israel is making use of [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2928.72s)]
*  changing facts on the ground. We are already seeing a shift in focus from the shape of the solution [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2935.2s)]
*  to a rights-based approach. People in the region, particularly Palestinians, if they are not given [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2944.0s)]
*  a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza are going to increasingly say, fine, if you don't want [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2949.76s)]
*  to give us a state, then we need equal political rights in the area that we live under. And the [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2955.68s)]
*  Palestinians today in Israel, property, West Bank and Gaza already are a majority. So the international [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2961.6s)]
*  community is not going to be able to ignore the Palestinians' call for equal rights for much [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2969.04s)]
*  longer. This is what we are going to be witnessing in the next Biden administration if Mr Biden [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2974.64s)]
*  becomes president. And I think we need to be bold and clear about it. We cannot keep repeating the [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2982.48s)]
*  mantra that we stand by a two-state solution. I'm a two-stater and I worked all my life on two states, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2990.4s)]
*  but we cannot keep repeating the mantra if it's not going to happen. We need to start looking at [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=2996.56s)]
*  the alternatives. Thank you, Marwan. I want to ask, you know, Jihad, who obviously, of course, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3002.7999999999997s)]
*  I forgot to mention, is the former finance minister of Lebanon. And we have Dania Ariassi, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3013.68s)]
*  who is asking about perspective for Lebanon in the middle of this political and financial crisis, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3019.84s)]
*  which is also obviously about the region. It's about Israel-Palestine. It's about Syria. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3025.2s)]
*  What are your reflections on the deep crisis that Lebanon is in right now? What are the priorities? [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3030.8799999999997s)]
*  How is it going to get out of this political and obviously physical crisis with that massive bomb? [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3035.9199999999996s)]
*  And the effect on what we've just been talking about, plus Syria, which we haven't really talked [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3042.72s)]
*  about, but just the fact that, you know, I mean, can I say it? The bad guys won there. What effect [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3048.24s)]
*  is that on all of this we're talking about? Malcolm Kerr's vision for, you know, for a kind [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3054.56s)]
*  of a people-based progress in that region. Christian, let me say one word on the [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3062.56s)]
*  regional issues before getting to Lebanon that may require another hour of discussion. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3070.0s)]
*  I think we need also not to underestimate the deep scars that the region has been [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3075.76s)]
*  living over the decades. We host the largest community of refugees internally displaced. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3082.64s)]
*  We have several fragilities in different countries that were exacerbated in the last 10 years. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3090.16s)]
*  No possible solution, political or of any kind, can be done without the inclusion of those who [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3099.68s)]
*  are marginalized. And if we don't find a Marshall Plan or whatever we call it, [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3107.6s)]
*  that would address those wounds and heal them, we will be in a situation where we can address [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3116.8s)]
*  maybe the political transformation, but we will fail in the long run because we will have pockets [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3122.88s)]
*  of challenges that will come and bite us back. I think it's very important when we look at the [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3128.4s)]
*  future, we look at the multi-dimensional approach that we need to have. And this is something that [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3134.64s)]
*  needs to be done at the country level and the case also for Lebanon and Jordan who are hosting [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3141.6s)]
*  refugees, but also at the regional level. Going back to Lebanon and very quickly, Lebanon is [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3145.6s)]
*  enduring a series of crisis, a crisis of confidence, an economic crisis, and a political crisis that [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3151.2s)]
*  has led to all of that. And more recently, the humanitarian crisis, the bombing, the explosion [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3159.68s)]
*  that took place in August is something that is devastating. This port has been created 150 [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3166.3199999999997s)]
*  years ago at the same time with the American University of Beirut. And the two of those [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3174.3199999999997s)]
*  landmarks led to what Beirut was and became as a beacon for openness, exchange of ideas, [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3180.64s)]
*  exchange also through trade. And therefore, if we don't heal this wound, we will destroy gradually [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3189.36s)]
*  what Beirut is. And I believe in the importance of symbols. And this is an important symbol to [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3196.48s)]
*  address. Of course, Lebanon has several challenges and they require a reform program that is [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3202.88s)]
*  comprehensive that addresses all these issues with the strong support of those maybe who led the [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3209.1200000000003s)]
*  situation to where it is today. And maybe it's the irony. Without that, it's very difficult to [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3215.68s)]
*  convince the Lebanese people to come and work and invest in Lebanon. Very difficult to convince the [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3220.64s)]
*  international community. And also very difficult really to bring confidence back because when you [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3226.08s)]
*  destroy confidence, it takes very limited time. But bring it back, it takes a long period. And [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3232.0s)]
*  Lebanon is a country where confidence has played an important role to keep an unsustainable situation [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3237.8399999999997s)]
*  sustainable for many years. And this is where I think it's an epic phenomena or a phenomena that [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3243.76s)]
*  presents many other phenomena in the region where if we don't go to the root of the issues and we [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3251.2000000000003s)]
*  try to create agreements or bargains that would lead to a transformation of the contract that [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3258.0s)]
*  exists between people, all solutions will be temporary and can be unwound whenever you have [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3265.76s)]
*  a new change in one of the superpower administrations. And this is the curse of the region so far. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3272.24s)]
*  We're in our last five minutes and I want to just do another quick round incorporating some of these [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3282.24s)]
*  questions but I'll just put them to each of you. If you could just, I'd like to end with you all [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3288.0s)]
*  looking and thinking about an island of hope or an area where you think in that region there is [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3292.72s)]
*  something that we should be looking at so that we can perhaps direct the camera lens, direct [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3297.84s)]
*  policymakers, direct people to emulate and spread that in the spirit of Malik and Cur education, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3304.0s)]
*  cultural exchange, people, young people, etc. So Marwan, you mentioned Tunisia, I don't know if [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3312.2400000000002s)]
*  you want to talk about Tunisia but you go ahead. Yes, I want to mention two islands of hope. One is [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3319.2000000000003s)]
*  Tunisia, Christian. Why Tunisia? Because they understood early on that they needed a new social [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3326.72s)]
*  contract, one that called for a peaceful alteration of power, one that gave women almost equal rights, [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3331.3599999999997s)]
*  certainly by far the best in the Arab world and one that also showed that Islam and democracy [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3339.68s)]
*  can coexist. These are three great lessons from Tunisia. And the second island of hope is civil [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3345.2s)]
*  society, Christian. Just look at civil society across the Arab world, particularly in areas of [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3350.72s)]
*  conflict. Look at what it is doing in Syria, look at what it's doing in Lebanon, look at what it's [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3356.48s)]
*  doing in Algeria, in Tunisia. These are islands of hope. This is a new generation, as I said, I once [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3361.68s)]
*  wrote in my book, this generation revolted not against their parents but on behalf of them. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3369.9199999999996s)]
*  They are no longer willing to live by the same rules and yes, it will take maybe 50 years. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3375.52s)]
*  Let no one fool themselves that this is an easy or a short process. But this is a generation that [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3382.4s)]
*  is not going to wait another decade that we waited for without governance coming to this region. I'm [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3390.32s)]
*  truly hopeful, not because I want to be optimistic, but because this is what history teaches us. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3397.92s)]
*  This is the cycle of history. It's happening everywhere and it's happening in the Arab world. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3406.48s)]
*  Look for Tunisia and look for civil society in the Arab world. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3410.96s)]
*  Okay, so that's great. And Ben, from a US perspective, from a US policy perspective, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3415.2000000000003s)]
*  you talk about investing in civil society is just such a great way to do it. Can you imagine [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3420.4s)]
*  an American foreign policy, you know, the ecosystem there, really putting more attention, [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3427.04s)]
*  or at least equal attention, on civil society and all that goes around with it? [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3434.96s)]
*  You know, candidly, Christiane, I don't know. I would hope so. To me, because I shared the same [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3440.56s)]
*  islands of hope and I engage with civil society actors in the region and it's remarkable. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3445.36s)]
*  You know, in very difficult circumstances, in places like Egypt where there's huge risk, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3450.32s)]
*  that young people are not giving up. They don't want to be silenced. They don't have their voices [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3455.6s)]
*  taken away and that's not going away. For the US, it's a two pronged response, Christiane, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3459.4399999999996s)]
*  very quickly. Part of it is, yes, we have to support civil society, but part of it is, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3466.3999999999996s)]
*  we have to prioritize that over, you know, the discomfort that might create with some of our [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3470.56s)]
*  autocratic, quote unquote, allies in the region. And so to me, the real test in this is going to be, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3476.64s)]
*  well, we're not going to continue to provide these kinds of weapons to Saudi Arabia if they're [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3483.2s)]
*  repressing their civil society in this way. Why is Egypt the second largest recipient of US foreign [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3489.52s)]
*  assistance in the world, given the fact that there are tens of thousands of political prisoners [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3494.96s)]
*  locked up? So to me, yes, it's about supporting civil society. It's also about suggesting [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3498.8799999999997s)]
*  that there's not going to be this kind of open spigot because the message that sends is, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3504.3999999999996s)]
*  we don't care about civil society as much as we care about this, which is giving you these weapons [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3509.12s)]
*  because it serves our interest in either counterterrorism or, quote unquote, stability. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3515.92s)]
*  So I would hope that the sea change that takes place in the US foreign policy establishment [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3520.56s)]
*  is recognizing that that has not been a recipe for stability. And not only does that offend [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3525.2799999999997s)]
*  our values in terms of the very leaders we are supporting are repressing civil society that we [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3531.2s)]
*  claim to support, but it's not achieving the outcomes that we are self-set in the region. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3536.08s)]
*  So I agree on the hope, and I'd like to see the US prioritize that, so that support for civil society [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3540.96s)]
*  over, again, the discomfort it might create with some of its autocratic allies. And it's not to say [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3549.36s)]
*  we can upend the whole order ourselves, nor should we. It just means a nation should reflect its [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3555.44s)]
*  priorities in its foreign policies. And I'd like to see our priorities shift towards the people [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3561.04s)]
*  and away from the people repressing them. So literally we have a minute, Jihad, [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3565.84s)]
*  is that possible? For instance, one of the sort of leet motifs, if you like, is corruption. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3572.6400000000003s)]
*  It's corruption with money from the US, money from everywhere that goes into these countries, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3577.84s)]
*  and then they use it and put in their pockets or to enrich themselves, their cronies, [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3582.0s)]
*  with disastrous results. How likely is it that the US or any other nation can make help, whatever it [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3586.0s)]
*  is, conditional on civil society and all the things that we all believe in and that Malcolm [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3594.24s)]
*  Kerr believed in and what this legacy is all about? Well, Christiane, the pandemic crisis provided [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3600.64s)]
*  some silver linings, and this is one of them. When we provided assistance, for example, for countries [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3607.3599999999997s)]
*  to address the COVID-19 shock, we made sure that, as our engine director said, spend it but keep the [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3611.68s)]
*  receipts. And I think this is one important step going forward to make sure that money is being [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3619.84s)]
*  used and in the right place. Technology also proved to be one of the other silver linings. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3625.04s)]
*  And I very much believe in the utilization of technology in expanding learning, expanding [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3630.96s)]
*  learning to students in schools, but also expanding learning to allow people to convert into new [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3637.04s)]
*  industries. We are going to see some industries dying and others growing, and therefore we need [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3642.2400000000002s)]
*  also to provide the knowledge, the skill building for the young generation. The third, I would say, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3647.12s)]
*  silver lining is the role of women. And I would very much, this is echoing what Marwan is saying [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3657.2799999999997s)]
*  about Tunisia, see women leading and addressing some of the issues that would allow not only [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3664.0s)]
*  development to flourish but also the transformation in the society to happen. And to happen in a way [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3671.2s)]
*  that will bring greater development in terms of economic but also social and cultural. And the [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3680.08s)]
*  power of culture, the power of education is what will save this region. Investing in culture, [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3688.7999999999997s)]
*  investing in education, if there is anything left, should be the one where we need to put all our [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3695.4399999999996s)]
*  resources and we bet on the future. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3700.96s)]
*  So I want to thank Marwan and Ben. I want to also admit that now looking at my screen, [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3703.12s)]
*  I may have got the questions from the wrong column, but all the comments and questions were [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3733.7599999999998s)]
*  very similar. And what we've discussed is very much reflected in all the comments and questions. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3739.84s)]
*  So that was great. I'm handing back to Bill Burns. And I would just like to say thank you. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3744.88s)]
*  It's a great pleasure and honour to be with Ann Kerr as well and with all of you. Thank you all so much. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3750.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3757.36s)]
*  Well, thank you all. Thanks, Christiane. Thanks for a great panel discussion. Thanks to Ann Kerr [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3757.86s)]
*  and the Kerr family. It's really an honour for us to rename the Middle East Centre. And I think the [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3765.94s)]
*  conversation, Christiane, you just hosted was a wonderful reflection of everything that Malcolm [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3772.9s)]
*  Kerr's legacy is about. So thanks all of you for joining us today and take good care of yourselves. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3778.9s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3785.46s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsI0G4oO3fg&t=3787.86s)]
