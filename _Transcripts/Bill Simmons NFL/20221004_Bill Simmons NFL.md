# Bill Simmons Is Pleasantly Surprised With the Patriots | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [October 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNC-dL6aNiY)
*  Can we talk about that Patriots game for a second?
*  Yeah.
*  Because I think people are going to be down on the Packers coming out of that game.
*  I thought the Patriots, Kyle was a witness, Van Lathan was a witness today.
*  I said before the game, the Pats were either going to win or lose by three.
*  I really believe they're going to do the old school, run the ball, occasional play action,
*  good pass rush.
*  It just felt like an early 2000s Pats game.
*  And it really was.
*  And I think if Hoyer doesn't get hurt, I actually think they would have won.
*  Zappie had a couple of good moments and it was fun that he didn't self-combust.
*  But their last three, they had three, three and outs to end the game.
*  Two in the fourth quarter and one in OT.
*  He just, the moment got too big for him.
*  He was a third string quarterback a week ago.
*  But I think the Pats are actually, I think they're pretty good.
*  I know they're one of the three, but-
*  I think your defense kept it in there too.
*  I didn't see a lot of separation from these Green Bay receivers, pass catchers as nifty
*  as Aaron Rodgers were.
*  Like your Chauvin, Bentleys and Adrian Phillips were all over the place, I felt.
*  They actually had a good draft for once.
*  They have a pass rush.
*  They have two good running backs.
*  I think Stevenson and Harris are both good.
*  They have multiple guys that no star receivers, but at least guys who can kind of get open.
*  And the quarterback position has killed them the whole season.
*  Zach was bad for the first three games and Zappi today, he didn't kill them, but he also,
*  they needed him to make a couple of plays and he just, you know, he's the third string
*  QB.
*  But I think the team is good.
*  You can't ask for more than a third string, than 10 for 15 for 99.
*  I know.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  He was fine.
*  But they just needed him to make one play in those last three drives.
*  My point is, I think this Pats, I don't want to compare it to 2001.
*  They had that game against the Rams on a Sunday night when they lost to the Rams, but you
*  came way going, this team's good.
*  I think this team, other than the QB position is good.
*  And if Matt can come back and be more like the Mac from last year and not, not turn the
*  ball over.
*  And this is a team that should just run the ball, play defense.
*  They hit on all their fourth round picks.
*  The kick returner today, who I don't know where he was the first three games, Marcus
*  Jones was the most exciting kick return they've had since Cordero Patterson.
*  Jack Jones, who fell to the fourth round because he got kicked out of school a few
*  years ago because he tried to rob a pair or break into a Panda Express.
*  So Kyle and I call him Panda Jack.
*  We're pro Jack Jones.
*  We love him, but he's really good at cornerback.
*  And then Zappie, who didn't embarrass himself.
*  I think most guys would have taken a shit in the field.
*  I think the Pats are pretty good.
*  I wouldn't rule them out as a seven seed.
*  Okay.
*  Well, that's funny.
*  Yeah, no, look, we just went over how nobody's great.
*  So of course you're going to have to get to nine wins.
*  So if you think you look at that schedule and you could go eight and five the rest of
*  the way, because that's, that's what you have to do.
*  I don't think I no longer think it's 10 and seven in the AFC.
*  I think nine and eight, these teams fighting each other is good enough.
*  Well, first four weeks they play at Miami.
*  It turns out Miami, I think is a good team.
*  We would agree.
*  They play at Pittsburgh.
*  They win.
*  They lose to Baltimore.
*  I think we can agree Baltimore is like a legit contender.
*  And then they lose to Green Bay in overtime today.
*  But then it gets a little easier.
*  They got Detroit at Cleveland, Chicago at the Jets, Indy home for the Jets next six
*  weeks.
*  So they might be come out of that and be, you know, potentially five and what was five
*  and four.
*  Was it four than five at midfield or were they even on the Packer side of the field
*  when they punted?
*  Well, the punter five or more.
*  Yeah.
*  No, it was more than four than five.
*  The punter really hurt them today.
*  I mean, really, the reason they lost that game today was the punter.
*  He was awful.
*  I have the Pats favored by two over the Lions.
*  Am I a complete idiot?
*  I had the Lions favored by two and a half.
*  You get it. It's Pats by two and a half.
*  Oh, OK.
*  Why?
*  Why? I'm telling you.
*  Why? Zappi's favored already against the Pro team?
*  I think the Pats are pretty good.
*  I felt I thought they would keep the Packers game close.
*  I'll tell you this.
*  Belichick was into the game today.
*  You watch the game today, right?
*  That was he was old school, getting mad at the refs, whipping his hands.
*  He got so mad at that one.
*  When they had the opportunity to review that call, he was furious.
*  He was running down the sideline calling timeouts.
*  He was talking to Zappi.
*  They cut over the side.
*  It really felt like Belichick was like, I think he likes this team.
*  I don't think he's like the quarterback play, but I think he likes the team.
*  This is like a very prototypical early 2000s.
*  Belichick team.
*  Yeah. If his game plan going into it is we're going to run and we're going to play
*  old school defense, what's better for him?
*  Yeah. Makes him look great.
*  Right. And that's basically what they did.
*  Yeah. And you're right.
*  There were a couple of plays away from the quarterback from from winning.
*  But I don't know. They should be, you know, you talked about Detroit
*  as bad and stupid a team as they are sometimes.
*  They score 24 points a game usually. Right.
*  Hmm. Yeah, you'd think.
*  I don't know.
*  One thing I heard is, you know, I have some pats birdies.
*  Craft loves Zappi.
*  Oh, and Craft thought he should have started this week over Hoare.
*  He's like all in on Zappi.
*  So I don't know. We'll see. Wow.
*  You know, this is all in on Zappi.
*  Nephew Kyle, you've never seen anybody get dumped faster
*  than Mac Jones did for an hour.
*  Billy Zappi just did a couple of things and Kyle basically took his Mac Jones
*  jersey and just buried it in my backyard.
