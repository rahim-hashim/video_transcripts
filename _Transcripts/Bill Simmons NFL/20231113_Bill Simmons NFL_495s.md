# Great Win by the Lions or Bad Loss by the Chargers? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [November 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXNdKenOwkQ)
*  Lions Chargers, great win or bad loss?
*  If you had to pick one.
*  Well, I think the better team won.
*  So I'm going to say good win, great win.
*  I'm going to say better win, but bad loss for all the teams you mentioned that are four
*  and five, five and four for the Chargers.
*  Like this made you think today made you think AFC North could have four playoff teams.
*  So it's a bad loss for a team like the Chargers in that regard.
*  But I always thought Detroit was just better throughout the whole game.
*  And the last team with the ball won kind of thing.
*  And it's a great same game parlay game.
*  So that's it.
*  So they had that fourth and two near the end.
*  There was a moment in this game and I texted you and the fellows about it was 38 to 38.
*  And the Lions had 488 yards and zero turnovers.
*  And you're just like, how is this a tie game?
*  All they've done this entire game is move up and down the field and get every play they want.
*  So they get to drive again, they immediately go down, they get the game winning field goal.
*  They finished 533 yards, 23 first downs.
*  There are four, four, five on fourth down.
*  And there was that key fourth down play fourth and two where it's like, oh, should we try
*  a long field goal here?
*  What should we do?
*  I vacillate depending on the situation and the team in this case, it was like, they have
*  to go for this.
*  They're getting eight to 10 yards of play.
*  I'm positive they're going to get this unless something horrible happens.
*  They were a really nice player.
*  Great.
*  Yeah.
*  Every play was great.
*  The guy was wide open by six yards.
*  Tight ends, snucks, sneaks out and just goes and gets it.
*  I think they could have won this game by two scores.
*  That one drive by the Chargers started at the end of the third quarter and ended at the
*  beginning of the fourth and a touchdown was a lot of that was bullshit.
*  That really was like a lot of double calls and a path Phantom pass interference and just
*  weird stuff.
*  So they should, I didn't think they should have scored there, but.
*  This was the fishiest game of the day and all the money was in the Lions.
*  There was a fourth down and goal to go.
*  They had a great stand and they called a PI on somebody and it was so dubious that they
*  had to use the furthest away camera to show the replay.
*  They're like, Oh, I think I see it there.
*  It's like, you guys have cameras right in the end zone.
*  Like I guarantee you have a better look of the guy briefly holding his waist for a split
*  second and they ended up running with eight plays inside the two yard line before they
*  finally scored in the second, fourth down.
*  It did fell fishy and I kept waiting for like the Lions holding penalties, something like
*  that.
*  But that's the Chargers too, right?
*  Like I'm like, wow, how are they going to win a game like this where things are going
*  their way actually?
*  Like, no, they didn't.
*  They're the Chargers, but yeah, that was interesting with the camera.
*  Tough game for the Lions defense.
*  If you're just thinking about them from a title aspect, because guys and the Chargers
*  were open the entire game.
*  Keaton Allen, who had the classic Keaton Allen game, I think he had 20 catches for
*  380 yards.
*  He went in the blue tent twice.
*  He left.
*  It seemed like it was over.
*  They're just throwing red flags next to his name for an hour.
*  And then also he's back in the game.
*  But Herbert, who I thought was shaking the first quarter and then he came on and you
*  couldn't complain about their offense, but they just couldn't get stops.
*  There were more Detroit fans than Chargers fans.
*  The line was two and a half.
*  It ended at two.
*  So they ended up covering basically for the whole week.
*  All right, Lions Chargers.
*  Here's my Jared Goff question.
*  Kyle might have to turn on the camera.
*  Is Jared Goff legitimately good?
*  Like, I'm not saying is Jared Goff good.
*  I'm saying is he legitimately good?
*  Because the guy I watched today seems super comfortable, made all the right throws, had
*  some great touch throws with feel.
*  He could throw it deep.
*  He could wing it.
*  He was always on on command.
*  Like he never had like a really bad pick, almost pick.
*  He never had a stupid Jared Goff fumble, the shotgun snap, nothing.
*  He was just smooth sailing for four quarters on the road.
*  I was really impressed and I've been impressed all year.
*  And he's at the point now where it's like, I think he's becoming what we thought Lawrence
*  was going to be this year.
*  I think he took the Lawrence spot in the top 10.
*  I'm going to give you my top 10 in a second.
*  But do you agree that he's legitimately good now?
*  First of all, I don't know who's good anymore.
*  I go by who I enjoy watching because you're like, oh, Gardner Minschner.
*  No, no, he's good.
*  Leave him alone.
*  No, don't throw him in that class with Tommy Devito.
*  He's good.
*  I'm like, all right, I'm going to go by who I enjoy watching.
*  He's definitely one of seven or eight quarterbacks I enjoy watching.
*  And he's excellent.
*  Excellent in this system.
*  Excellent.
*  Yeah, it's almost like you take it's like a movie or something where a bunch of kids
*  get adopted by different families and you see where the kids get turned out.
*  And he got adopted by the family with the good offensive line and the awesome offensive
*  coordinator.
*  And now he's putting it together and he's way better than maybe ever thought.
*  But if he'd gone to like Arizona, it would have been a disaster.
*  Maybe we're one day.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Yeah, I've made my top 10 and you got the Mahomes.
*  These are top 10 best just best.
*  Well, so I just made a list.
*  I'm like, is he top 10 now?
*  Mahomesboro hurts Lamar Allen.
*  That's your top five.
*  Right.
*  And then Herbert's right there is the sixth and then to assume he stays healthy.
*  And then it's like Stroud and Goff and Dak in some order.
*  And that's the 10 and Lawrence isn't in there and neither is Brock Purdy and neither is
*  Matthew Stafford because he can't play more than four straight games.
*  And then it drops off quickly to like Gino and Kyler and Baker.
*  We don't even have 15 quarterbacks.
*  I trust anymore.
*  So now, of course, this is the worst.
*  This is like, and we try to convince ourselves.
*  I'm not saying this golf example is one of them, but I think we're always trying to
*  convince ourselves.
*  All right.
*  Maybe this guy is good.
*  Like that prison meal I had the other day.
*  It was good.
*  They use like three beans.
*  Like now that black bean, that was shit.
*  Somebody just shit in the back.
*  That was it.
*  Like, you really I think we're stuck with what we're stuck with.
*  And he's definitely top seven.
*  Wow.
*  You're going seven.
*  Okay.
*  So you put them seven.
*  He and DAC are right in there.
*  Seven, eight, nine.
*  Yeah.
*  Do cousins cousins cousins on anymore?
*  Yeah.
*  Cousins is gone.
*  The most interesting to me is that interesting thing to me is that Lawrence
*  definitely dropped out of the top 10.
*  Like he just hasn't been good enough to share.
*  And there's been too many games where you've just feel like they're way behind the eight ball.
*  He can't get anything going.
*  Their offense, I think, has been probably the biggest disappointment in the AFC.
*  I was also stunned making the list that according to my calculations,
*  this means Baker is a top half of the league quarterback.
*  If you put him 16.
*  He's in the upper half.
*  Kind of nuts.
*  But yeah, I think that golf trade, when you figure they got a first round pick,
*  they were able to get rid of the Stafford money.
*  And then they get this guy that, you know, they're able to salvage.
*  It's pretty impressive.
*  Lions are good.
*  I don't, I really wonder about their defense zone, whether they can get stops.
*  Like when they play your team in the playoffs, when they play, you know, Philly,
*  anybody, San Francisco, anybody who can throw the ball,
*  they're going to be able to stop that team.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, they had no sacks today.
*  Right.
*  And then sometimes they'll have eight sacks.
*  I think that's the weirdest thing.
*  The worst dichotomy we have to go through week after week.
*  I don't think we've seen more, more eight sack games than we have this year.
*  And then, but then it'll disappear.
*  So you don't even really know what you're watching from week to week.
*  Right.
*  So the Chargers, four and five.
*  And they're looking the rest of the way.
*  They're playing green.
*  Act Green Bay, never easy.
*  Home Baltimore at the Pats.
*  Easy.
*  Home Denver at Vegas, home Buffalo at Denver, home Casey in a game that Casey might not care.
*  So there's certainly not out of it.
*  I wouldn't say that's like a murderers row of a schedule.
*  All right.
*  So we both agree that that was a better win for the Lions than a loss for the Chargers.
*  All right.
