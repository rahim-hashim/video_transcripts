# Is Tom Brady Actually a Bad Teammate? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [October 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-jo69Fkjfs)
*  Combo of it doesn't seem like he's had enough reps with the receivers yet
*  The line as as we saw with him screaming at screaming at them during the timeout
*  I don't think he wants to get hit anymore, and I feel like the Rogers thing and the Brady thing is similar
*  Both of these guys. I don't know whether they're kind of saving it for the last half of the season
*  But just I test he's getting rid of the ball. I would say a half to a full second
*  Faster than he needs to he's not holding it for that extra. I'm gonna get killed, but I'm gonna wait
*  Yeah, he's just not he's just getting rid of it
*  And he doesn't look like Brady and I think he's getting frustrated everybody else
*  But he doesn't practice on Wednesday's fucking went to Bob crafts wedding on Wednesday on Friday night in New York City
*  I didn't think he wanted to do that either.
*  Right why is he in New York City on Friday night? That's insane. He's supposed to be the leader of the team
*  He's got all the rules are different for him
*  This preseason for ten days like football supposed to be this team sport where everybody's on the same side
*  Nobody's bigger than the team. He's acted like he's bigger than the team for ten months got his coach fired all the shit
*  He's doing like I think it's an embarrassing year for him. I really do. It's what it's one thing
*  I think it is too
*  And it's one thing to leave your team in the preseason and then that just pisses off potentially some of your teammates
*  But to skip a practice skip the walkthrough on Saturday
*  And then the Steelers find out about this now you're giving other teams bulletin board material, right? So now you're pissing off everybody
*  Yeah, this is a sound. This is an embarrassment. Yeah, you know, you know who wasn't at Bob crafts wedding on Friday night Bailey fucking Zappi
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah, you know where he was in his hotel room studying for the Browns. Stop it. That's the next Tom Brady right there
*  Stop this. Yeah, 2001 Tom Brady's in his hotel room studying for the Browns. This is crazy talk
*  I'm just on rounds. It's I don't think I who do you think regrets more?
*  Brady just coming back or Rogers
*  Loading up with this giant Green Bay contract that now made them trade Adams and now
*  His team clearly doesn't have it. Well, let me I'll do you one better. Are we sure?
*  Either one of those was ever good Brady or Rogers
*  Maybe I took a two-plug. All right. No, no, I think Rogers right now regrets it
*  But I think Brady
*  I'm trying to think of it's funny because I was thinking what if he went to the Dolphins now
*  They've had four quarterbacks hurt in four consecutive weeks, which is right just unheard of the starter goes out
*  But I think he's bummed he went came back to Tampa Bay after all that. I think he's got Miami. Yeah
*  Yeah, I think he is too. I think
*  There's real regret
*  He's got a lot of personal life shit going and the irony of the whole thing is Tampa's probably
*  Either the second or third best team in the NFC and as we see year after year
*  It matters where you are around Thanksgiving. It doesn't really matter where you are now where it does matter is
*  Our wallets because you and I had the bucks and rightfully so just thrown into parlays and teasers
*  It's like alright, they they actually need to win the game
*  They're favored by 10 against this decimated Steelers team. They're put who's playing pick it then we get the gift of pick it gets hurt
*  During the game not a gift we opened it up. It was a turn
*  Yeah, yeah Mitch comes in Mitch is completing third and 14s over the middle. He's throwing dimes to
*  Chase Claypool to extend drives. He's running around. It's like what the hell is going on?
*  I'm gonna lose to Mitch Trubisky. I did and they killed the clock and the Steelers had like three important forget about what he's out
*  But three other like important players out, you know
*  Fitzpatrick and the others and that's what I thought I was like, alright Tampa's offense is gonna get right again
*  No, never happened. I mean really when you look at it like
*  Stafford did that ended up winning because Panthers can't play four quarters of football
*  But you know when Stafford Brady and Rogers can't put up a touchdown in the first half of any either of their games
*  I was looking at these numbers here. Look at these winning numbers. Gino Smith 197 yards Kirk Cousins
*  175 Daniel Jones 173 Jalen hurts
*  155
*  155 I think they had like 260 yards of offense Trubisky 144 Marriotta 129 Zach Wilson 110
*  These are all winners today. I know this guy this guy used to be this incredible team guy
*  What happened is he's yelling at teammates? He does whatever the fuck he wants
*  This is exactly who he wasn't on the Patriots for like 20 years. No, he was a team guy
*  See it you don't want to see it. He was just doing it on the sly. He didn't let Belichick
*  No, it was just wasn't as public about it
