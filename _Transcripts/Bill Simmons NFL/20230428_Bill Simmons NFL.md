# Did the Jets Give Up Too Much for Aaron Rodgers? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [April 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OJgsIuU_X8)
*  Rogers though, let's go there.
*  I was appalled by this trade for the Jets, and I was with Sean Fennessy last night, and he's like trying to sell me out.
*  He's like, look, we have this window. We might have seven Pearl Bowers, you know, down the road, and we need legitimacy, and we needed a guy.
*  And you just got to give up what you got to give up to get it.
*  And the counter is they had no other offers. He was a sunk cost. He had nowhere else to go, and he was going to destroy their team.
*  Why did they have to give up actual assets? They moved back from 13 to 15, gave up a conditional first, and they gave up a second in this year's draft.
*  Why not just a second and be done with it?
*  I think they tried, and I think that Brian Guttenkens, the GM of the Packers, said, yeah, he won the MVP in two of the last three years, so you can call us back when you're serious.
*  And there was a staring contest there. There was the Jets saying, no, we've got leverage. Rogers won't go anywhere else but here.
*  And the Packers saying, no, we've got leverage because you might have to start Zach Wilson next year if you can't figure this out, right?
*  The Lamar situation was the trap door for the Jets. All they needed to do was go fly down and take a meeting.
*  All they needed to do was present like they had another franchise quarterback option besides Rogers.
*  They were so fast to say, no, we're not interested in Lamar. We're good. We know our plan.
*  And to me, that gave the Packers a good amount of momentum, a good amount of leverage such that they were able to get what's a square price for an MVP quarterback, get a first round pick.
*  What do you think? I just think they blinked like they needed to get this length. I think they had a seizure.
*  Right. Right. I mean, I just think they wanted to get it done before the draft, you know, because they had to go through this whole plan to do what they're going to do in the draft.
*  They wanted to have the quarterback set. And so waiting until after the draft, it seems like it would just like throw everything in upheaval for them.
*  And so and maybe it came down from a pie to like to just get this thing done. Well, that's what it sounds like.
*  It sounds like the owners like, I'm old, go get them. I might be dead soon. I don't have time to wait.
*  There was that reporting that Woody, the owner for the Jets was ready to send a first round pick for Rogers.
*  And then Rogers hopped on McAfee and was like, I was 85 percent retired.
*  And he was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, like, let's not commit this much draft capital.
*  But they went in for a penny and for a pound. Like in March, they committed with Alan Lazard and with the discourse with the Jets, the Packers, excuse me.
*  They committed to this idea of Rogers as a jet. And once their their their pot committed like that, who can squeeze on them?
*  And I think that that's that's that's good work by the Packers front office.
*  It reminded me of succession when Logan Roy, like season three, was like, oh, I just got to get this deal done.
*  And he's just screaming at people and calling everybody a fuckface and telling them to fuck off.
*  They just kind of that. I just don't get it. I would have handled this like I would love to play poker with the Jets.
*  Be like, are you guys in? I'm totally in. I have two aces. I'm in. OK, I'm out.
*  I just thought they should have pretended they like Lamar. This isn't hard.
*  Just pretend you like Lamar Jackson. Pretend you're going to be like, you know what?
*  Going to wait till after the draft. After the draft, maybe we'll make a play at Lamar with our next two first round picks.
*  And then the Packers like, oh, shit, what if they do that or other player like Trey Lance, who's still out there potentially as a trade partner or whatever.
*  Don't let Mike White leave. It's Mike White. But still, you're not. Yeah, you're showing the Packers.
*  The only quarterback we have is Zach Wilson, who everybody here doesn't like the team.
*  All the teammates tweeting immediately after this went through is like, oh, God, that is bad.
*  It's just there was right. There was very little. It was a Tom Brady play.
*  They could have been like, Tom, we're going to pay you a million dollars just pretend for 12 hours.
*  Like there might be some mutual interest in the two of us. Yeah. Well, why are you the money?
*  We'll be good to go. Well, they got them. It's just funny.
*  Like, I just feel like they gave up an extra asset for no reason. Moving back from 13 to 15. Who cares? Yeah.
*  The second round pick. That makes sense. But then the other one is going to be 65 percent of the place becomes a first round.
*  Which is as light of a condition as you'll find in a trade. Yeah.
*  Everybody kind of expected it's got to be tied to performance, pro bowl, playoff performance or in the ideal world for the Jets tie it to twenty twenty four playing time.
*  Ensure that Rogers plays for another season to tie it to twenty twenty three playing time.
*  It's such a low number. Huge win for the Packers.
*  I don't think it's going to be an emotional farewell for from Green Bay for Aaron.
*  You don't think like when he goes back to Lambeau, do they play him though?
*  I will remember you video or whatever. Like one of those.
*  What's the one they play with? What's the one they always play when everybody comes back?
*  Like, oh, I don't even know. I'm coming home. Oh, I'm coming home.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Like, do they even play a video on the screen for him?
*  No, my big packer fans like him. Yeah.
*  I'm going to get booed. Oh, 100 percent.
*  You can't not boo him.
*  In eight, him wearing eight is going to be weird, too.
*  I'm not about that. Like, oh, it's a college number.
*  He can't wear twelve because of Namath.
*  Like, I guess Namath gave him his blessing, but he still wants to wear eight.
*  So that's going to be weird.
*  My main question is just do the Packers draft the first round receiver in the year that Rogers leaves?
*  Well, there's a couple of them right in that area.
*  Kick him out the door. Bye bye. I would love it.
*  Well, there was some indication that they moved up.
*  The Packers moved up in this because they want to get a receiver.
*  They want JSN, Jackson, Smith and Jigler.
*  And so this like helps them get it, which is even juicier.
*  As you know, I only root for the content if it's not one of my teams.
*  And this was much better content for us.
*  Aaron Rodgers in New York on the Jets. Yeah.
*  Incredible content. Jordan Love, is he good or not?
*  The Ewing theory potential of the Packers, which even though they won a title with Rogers, it's been.
*  I don't have to say the past 10 years, there is some Ewing theory potential and they're in a bad division.
*  It would be hilarious if they went like 11 and six and won the NFC North.
*  So many things I can't wait. So I'm glad it happened.
*  I just thought it was weird. OK.
