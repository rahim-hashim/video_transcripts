# NFL Guess the Lines Week 8 With Cousin Sal  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [October 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MweZc4qXCNU)
*  Let's do a little thing we like to call guess the lines.
*  Oh, I've heard about this.
*  Remember this thing?
*  Mm-hmm.
*  What's the record?
*  Four, two, and one, you're winning?
*  Yeah, look at that, you're winning four, two, one.
*  Yeah, there you go.
*  Thursday night, Vikings Rams.
*  Tough spot for the Vikes, man.
*  That was like a pretty hard-hitting playoff game,
*  crazy, intense, and now four days later,
*  you gotta just turn it back on.
*  It's in LA, are you going?
*  Kinda, no.
*  You going or you not going?
*  Not going to that.
*  Am I going to this?
*  I couldn't stay in Dodger Stadium.
*  Vikings Rams, so fine.
*  I wanted to kill somebody, yeah.
*  You kind of lived there too.
*  Did you see the parking for Dodger Stadium today?
*  How much was it?
*  It was $60 when I went on Monday, what was it today?
*  Oh, they jacked it today.
*  It was like for any decent lot, it was 200 bucks.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, and for the best lot, it was like 500 bucks.
*  Wow, what an asshole world we live in.
*  Yeah.
*  God almighty, yeah.
*  They're like 200 bucks or sit in traffic
*  for 100 minutes after the game.
*  Yeah, it's true.
*  They know they have you.
*  They have you.
*  You're going to leave early or you're going to spend
*  two and a half hours in this parking lot.
*  With your eight-year-old kid who needs to pee
*  and is super upset and ate too much sugar
*  and is having to melt down in the backseat.
*  Yeah, and avoid.
*  Or $20 and you can get out.
*  Avoid shady guys who are trying to sign
*  knockoff Otani T-shirts.
*  Thanks.
*  Thanks.
*  I have nowhere to go, but thanks.
*  I have Vikings minus three against the Williams in LA.
*  We both get it and we got it exactly right.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Did McVeigh, he might have played his cards right.
*  Like he rested, he rested Nakua and,
*  because he knew he had this Thursday coming, right?
*  So he rested both those guys and they should be back.
*  Cooper copy Nakua.
*  Try to sneak it out.
*  Smart move.
*  Yeah, it worked.
*  This feels like a stay away game to me.
*  Sure, I mean they're all, almost all of them are.
*  That guy, that guy verse on the Rams.
*  Yeah, it's my guy.
*  What were the defensive player odds for him?
*  Didn't you recommend that?
*  I bet it.
*  It was high, right?
*  It was like over, it was double digits.
*  It was like 10 to one, 12 to one, 14 to one.
*  I have 100 to win, 950.
*  Not, not, plus 950.
*  Yeah.
*  That's it.
*  Well, I think he's in the running.
*  He was really good in the Raiders game today.
*  Okay, Sunday Marquis.
*  Controversial, we don't usually do it this way
*  because this isn't the quote unquote best game.
*  And I'm not even positive one of the quarterbacks
*  is gonna be playing in this game.
*  Baltimore, Cleveland?
*  No, Washington, Chicago.
*  Yeah.
*  So what do you wanna do with this?
*  Because the line suggests pretty strongly
*  one way or another if he's playing.
*  So I don't know if you wanna throw this out
*  or do you wanna?
*  What is out with the injury?
*  What do we know?
*  Nothing?
*  Ribs and being evaluated tomorrow.
*  I think we throw it out.
*  Okay.
*  I would have guessed, assuming Daniels was playing,
*  I would have guessed Washington by three.
*  That's exactly right.
*  Doesn't matter, because that's what I had too.
*  And it's Chicago one and a half.
*  So it seems like they don't think he's playing.
*  But I didn't mind, Mary.
*  I don't know.
*  He was okay.
*  Was there a Jaden Daniels won't get out of October bet?
*  Oh no.
*  I don't know if there was.
*  That was the big fair with him, right?
*  I think we even talked.
*  I mean, he's 140 pounds.
*  I know, he's gotta cover those ribs with something.
*  I only have two watchables this week.
*  By the way, they flexed that game, didn't they?
*  Wasn't that like a 1 p.m. kickoff?
*  They flexed it to 4 p.m. last week.
*  Oh, they did?
*  Yeah, now it's, yeah, they might have moved your guys up.
*  Jets Patriots was four, now it's back at one.
*  They maybe should have done it earlier.
*  Started at seven in the morning.
*  Watchables, Cincinnati home for Philadelphia.
*  I have Cincy by two and a half.
*  You got it exactly.
*  What is it?
*  I thought that was high.
*  It's two and a half.
*  I said one, so.
*  And then.
*  Why is three and four almost a field goal over four and two?
*  It's just power ratings at this point.
*  Are they two and five or three and four?
*  Three and four.
*  Yeah, three and four, yeah.
*  All the ranking stuff likes the Bengals.
*  I think that's right.
*  You talk about two teams I don't trust that everyone wants to
*  talk about in the playoffs.
*  I promise I will not bet on this game.
*  Yeah, if you see this on Million Dollar Picks,
*  you have to assume I'm now hooked on codeine
*  with like Vicodin attached to it.
*  I'm definitely on like hardcore drugs at that point.
*  All right, well that's what I'm moving for then.
*  Oh, Cincy, the Bengals by two and a half.
*  I'll make me do I have like a codeine IV.
*  Here's the other one.
*  Buffalo at Seattle.
*  This is just a good game.
*  This would have been the marquee game
*  if it wasn't the two rookie quarterbacks
*  going against each other.
*  I can't wait to watch this.
*  I think I nailed this.
*  Bills by one and a half at Seattle.
*  Yeah, I mean, this is one, you know,
*  if I think about it for 10, 15 seconds and I don't get it,
*  I go to my favorite one and a half.
*  So we bolted one and a half.
*  It's three.
*  Bills by three.
*  Wow.
*  Now do me a favor.
*  Will you do me a favor?
*  If the bills go down like 10-0,
*  will you and Hench not text me like,
*  I told you the bills to win the division
*  was a little sketchy.
*  We made a parlay with the Bills,
*  Houston, Kansas City, and Baltimore
*  to all win the divisions about even odds.
*  You can still get it about even odds.
*  The Bills, they're fine.
*  They're gonna take time.
*  If they need to win their last five, they'll do that.
*  They're great.
*  You know what I realized?
*  Cause I did my NBA Superboost this year,
*  which I've hit the last two years in a row
*  and I've also hit the last two NFL ones.
*  And I was like, what was the NFL Superboast
*  we did this year?
*  I forgot to do one.
*  Cause Fandl had that parlay booster thing.
*  We never actually did a Superboost.
*  Really?
*  I don't think we ever actually did one.
*  I just forgot.
*  They're giving us friendly names.
*  Token boost and this and that.
*  Yeah, they were doing those parlay,
*  they're throwing tokens at us.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think we would've done Detroit over.
*  I think we would've done Green Bay over.
*  And then I would've insisted on the Pats Under.
*  Although they don't love necessarily doing the Unders
*  with the parlay boost.
*  But I think it would've been something like that.
*  We wanna do a week eight Superboost token.
*  Superboost.
*  Congratulations reward.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I was really mad we didn't do that.
*  Anyway.
*  No break.
*  Fairly Watchables.
*  I got four Fairly Watchables and I have six poop Fectas.
*  Oh, Saruti reminds us, we did do a Superboost.
*  What was it, Saruti?
*  What'd we do?
*  Denver over with Seattle over.
*  Was our Superboost.
*  Oh, that's gonna be good.
*  We're gonna hit that.
*  Denver over was like, what was it, like six and a half wins?
*  Yeah.
*  And Seattle's over was eight and a half wins.
*  Yes, Denver was five and a half.
*  Thanks, Saruti.
*  And then Seattle I think was eight and a half.
*  And Denver has Carolina this week.
*  Oh man, we're gonna be so close right away.
*  Superboost, baby.
*  Kings of the Superboost.
*  I'm gonna do my own voice doing the Superboost.
*  Oh, you're so good at the Superboost.
*  Oh yeah, Saruti says he bet it.
*  I got the Sudafed Superboost of the day.
*  It's the special necklace with Cody and Superboost.
*  Four Fairly Watchables.
*  Packers Jags, it's both Watchable and will be a train wreck.
*  Coach Middleseat going against, with Feeling Good
*  after beating Jerod Mayo and the New England Patriots.
*  He's back, baby.
*  And now he's playing the Packers,
*  the team with the really good defense.
*  And they're gonna be home,
*  and I think Green Bay is gonna be favored by two and a half.
*  All right, I said four, it's four and a half.
*  Oh, Vegas zone.
*  Yeah, they've had enough for Jacksonville, I think.
*  They know.
*  Plus this is a pretty good coach against a
*  not so great traveling coach.
*  You see, he's got one win in the United States, right?
*  Yeah, that's true.
*  He's gonna hang himself with a seatbelt extender,
*  but they're good.
*  Maybe it's because these games are on early in the morning
*  and I know the Pats are involved,
*  and I was mad at how poorly coached we were.
*  But they're showing the Jags on the sidelines,
*  like smiling, excited near the end that they wanna,
*  made me upset.
*  I was in my glasses on my cold medication,
*  on my cold medication.
*  I'm like, fuck you, Trevor Lawrence.
*  I'm mad at him.
*  How dare you laugh at the end of this game?
*  They're coming home.
*  Oh, Bucks Falcons, I know where you're gonna bet this one.
*  I already see this.
*  What's your wise wager this year?
*  You're like five and two, right?
*  Five and two, yeah.
*  Yeah, I think I could see you grabbing the Bucks here.
*  I might, I might.
*  It's in Tampa, and I'm gonna say Bucks by two.
*  Um, do we split this?
*  Yeah, I have three.
*  It's two and a half.
*  Okay.
*  Can I tell you, this is one of the,
*  you know how I get depressed about,
*  forget about the Mets and the Cowboys and everything else,
*  but this time of year,
*  there's different times of the year where,
*  oh no, football's almost over.
*  This is the first week
*  where teams have already played each other.
*  So we saw the Bucks.
*  That makes you sad?
*  It does, yeah, because it makes me think,
*  oh man, now everybody's gonna start
*  having played each other twice in their divisions.
*  This was 36-30 a couple weeks ago on that Thursday night,
*  that crazy game that cousins threw for 500.
*  Well, maybe if you start feeling sad,
*  there'll also be happiness as the Dodgers
*  are beating the hell out of the Yankees,
*  and we can watch the Yankees lose,
*  and you can be like,
*  well, we lost to the eventual World Series champions,
*  which is always really comforting.
*  Yeah, second place, a true second place.
*  And not to put more pressure on the Dodgers,
*  but nobody counts the 2020 title.
*  Like, I know you have a banner.
*  I know you're excited about it,
*  but it was the 60-game season.
*  People are opting out.
*  There are no fans.
*  Like, come on.
*  That was about as fake of a title as anyone's won.
*  So, time to win everyone, guys.
*  The biggest story was Turner jumping in the team photo
*  right after, right?
*  And he had COVID, and everyone freaked out.
*  And everyone's like, oh no.
*  That was a bigger story than the non-parade.
*  I don't even remember who was in that playoffs.
*  Texans, Colts, it's in Houston.
*  It's an AFC South battle.
*  I don't know how much you saw Richardson today, but...
*  Yeah.
*  He...
*  Oh, be nice.
*  I had him on.
*  I had him on winning weekend.
*  He's not accurate.
*  He's not accurate.
*  Very nice guy.
*  Talked about Dairy Queen for a while.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm sure he's a nice guy.
*  His passes just kind of go all over the place.
*  And the other thing that's interesting is,
*  they don't use him like the Cam Newton battering ram anymore
*  because I think they're afraid he's gonna get hurt.
*  So, if you're not gonna play him,
*  unleash this maniac athlete,
*  but now you have kind of an inaccurate pocket passer,
*  I'm not sure that's the best use of him.
*  Yeah.
*  He was the one...
*  I love pointing out which halftime
*  of the 1PM Eastern game quarterbacks is doing...
*  You could always find someone with 30 yards.
*  I think he had 41 at half.
*  And that's probably why our friend JJ
*  almost ran into traffic
*  because they couldn't beat the Colts.
*  But he ran for 56 yards.
*  I mean, he was the leading rusher.
*  I don't know.
*  They didn't have to do much to beat the Stolphins today.
*  You know why JJ didn't run into traffic?
*  Because we beat the Guardians and we beat the Royals.
*  And we're in the World Series.
*  Next time I run into traffic, bro,
*  it'll be the parade in Bronx.
*  And I'll be on a float with Soto.
*  He should have gone in traffic
*  and asked if anyone on the street could name four Guardians.
*  Can you name four Guardians?
*  And not of the galaxy.
*  We're talking the baseball team.
*  Last but not least, fairly watchables,
*  Chiefs at Raiders.
*  And you can tell me...
*  We didn't pick a line for...
*  Oh, we didn't do Texans Colts?
*  My bad.
*  Texans minus four over the Colts, I have.
*  I said four also, it's five and a half.
*  Okay.
*  And that also was a rematch from week one, 29-27, Texans.
*  Yeah.
*  Chiefs at Raiders.
*  There's a little backstory.
*  Didn't somebody on the Raiders talk shit
*  about my home sport of the season?
*  Oh yeah, who was that?
*  Some doofus on the defense.
*  Doesn't sound right.
*  That's what happened.
*  So you gotta factor in with this line.
*  The Chiefs could easily be up like nine
*  with two minutes left and Pierce could be like,
*  we'll take the field goal.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Now we're down six.
*  Yeah, the Pierce effect.
*  This looks better in the newspaper.
*  I have Chiefs by seven in Vegas.
*  You know, I said seven also.
*  10.
*  Whoa! 10 is the number.
*  Oh, that's the first true shocker of the year.
*  That's a good one.
*  10?
*  In Vegas?
*  I think, well, there's a little payback, right?
*  Because they beat them on Christmas,
*  so they're not gonna be overlooked.
*  Or Vegas isn't afraid of them
*  because they beat them last year.
*  That line seems too high.
*  I went to this game three years ago.
*  I'm gonna fuck it up.
*  I'm gonna talk myself into them now.
*  But I went to this game three years ago in Las Vegas.
*  Ton of red, ton of red.
*  So much red there.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know what kind of advantage the Raiders have.
*  But you're right, there could be a piercing.
*  A piercing.
*  Should we call that like a ball piercing or something
*  when you get screwed on the spread
*  because Pierce kicks a field goal?
*  Pierce.
*  Do you think any of his coaches are like,
*  yo, coach, we're still gonna need a touchdown
*  if we kick this field goal.
*  And you're giving up all this field position.
*  Maybe try to get a pass interference or something.
*  Coach, that's four minutes in the fourth quarter.
*  You know that, right?
*  That's not third quarter.
*  That's a four.
*  Coach, it's the second half.
*  It's not pre-season.
*  Coach, it's three hours into the game, coach.
*  Don't be soft, we're kicking a field goal.
*  We're cutting it at five.
*  One stop.
*  And all that we have to do is go 90 yards
*  to get a touchdown instead of just going nine.
*  Oh man.
*  10 points.
*  You know, I was worried that at some point as I got older
*  that the coaching would get smarter
*  and there would be less stuff to make fun of.
*  And it's just not true every year.
*  And it's just not true every year.
*  Every week dumb shit happens.
*  Like Doug Peterson could just go up by 18
*  with 10 minutes left.
*  He's like, nope, fourth to two, let's go.
*  Let's do this.
*  I guarantee ex-coaches or maybe current coaches,
*  who knows, listen to us, maybe.
*  There's gotta be some.
*  And they must think we're assholes.
*  But there's 50 bad decisions a day.
*  And if we paid attention, there'd be 150.
*  What gives?
*  There's a whole aspect of a game
*  that you and I can coach better than these guys.
*  Most of them.
*  My friend Hershey, we were talking about quarterbacks.
*  And he's around our age.
*  And he's talking about the conundrum of Daniel Jones
*  where some Giants fans are like,
*  ah, Daniel Jones, he can do this, he can do that.
*  And he's like, I've been watching football my entire life
*  since I was a little kid.
*  I've been watching quarterbacks week in, week out
*  since the mid-70s.
*  I feel like I know if a quarterback has it
*  or not at this point.
*  It's not one of those talk yourself into it maybe.
*  It's like, you kinda know or you don't know if a guy has it.
*  And it's like, I have five decades of experience
*  now watching the signs for whether somebody has it or not.
*  And he doesn't have it.
*  And I was like, it's a great way to put it.
*  Yeah.
*  Because in some ways, we're getting slower and dumber
*  as we get older.
*  But in other ways, we've watched so much sports.
*  You kinda, you have the veteran experience
*  of just putting our 10 million hours in watching games.
*  Like riding a bike.
*  I see a pothole, I'm gonna go to the left of it.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, just what are you supposed to do?
*  Now, there's some politics involved.
*  Like, Stefanski, I don't wanna fully blame him
*  for this situation because it just cannot be possible.
*  No, there's no way.
*  That he wants to star Watson and nobody else.
*  Now it doesn't matter, but.
*  The poop factor.
*  Jets at Pats.
*  So the Jets somehow get to play the Pats twice
*  in the first half of the season.
*  One of the two worst teams in the league.
*  And I think this is Jets by six and a half.
*  Oh, you dirtbag.
*  I said seven is six and a half.
*  Now, what is the score here?
*  That is a teaser.
*  You're up seven, six.
*  Could be a hard week of practices for the Pats.
*  Gotta get tougher.
*  You think so?
*  I mean, you might just remain soft.
*  Mayo just took over the team.
*  He's gotta make this team tough.
*  Oh no, he's been here the whole season.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, what was it?
*  24-3 on that Thursday night?
*  Yeah, but that was with Berset.
*  Right, right, right.
*  Mayo's good.
*  They have something with May.
*  Now it's like, how do you build around this asset
*  and do you have the right coach
*  and the right front office to pick the right people
*  to put around a genuine asset?
*  And do all of your receivers have agents?
*  This is a catastrophe,
*  because this is so hard to find a quarterback
*  who's actually good, a young quarterback
*  who's actually talented and can move and has good arm.
*  They have the quarterback.
*  Who's the best quarterback, new quarterback,
*  on a team that's not very good
*  and he's been there for three years?
*  Trevor Lawrence.
*  I guess so.
*  That's like your worst case scenario, right?
*  They wanted the vision though.
*  Is there anyone hanging as like nine and eight?
*  Even the Chargers, I would say.
*  Herbert?
*  Yeah.
*  I'm sticking to him as the example, but.
*  Drake May's good.
*  Lions are home for the Titans,
*  and I think this is what you were alluding to
*  at the start of the podcast
*  about how we have some old school Lions.
*  At first, I instinctively put down Lions minus nine.
*  I was like, wait a second,
*  they're gonna jack this up,
*  and I just kept, and I went all the way to 13.
*  I've Lions by 13.
*  All right, I get you here.
*  You went a little high.
*  I said 11 and a half, it's 10 and a half.
*  Oh.
*  Right, let me see, maybe they moved it.
*  10 and a half.
*  It's too low.
*  It's too low.
*  I mean.
*  That's an automatic, automatic three team 10 point teaser.
*  Well, I was gonna say we should invite
*  an old friend into our life,
*  and there's another one we haven't hit yet,
*  but I think we have two so far.
*  I think you're thinking Lions over Titans,
*  and you're thinking Chiefs over Raiders.
*  I'm afraid of that Chiefs game.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah, I'm afraid of that one.
*  I would probably do the Jets as the second one.
*  Well.
*  They're gonna lose to the Pats and go two and six,
*  but they should just lead the team.
*  It's so much fun rooting against them, though.
*  Yeah, you're right.
*  All right, we'll find two teams,
*  but this is a free 10 points to use on a normal team.
*  The Titans stink.
*  This is our super bet boost, 10 point Totem pole boost.
*  Our 10 point Neckl coding boost.
*  Dolphins home for the Cardinals, a truly awful game.
*  Really bad.
*  Well, hold on though.
*  Is this the one?
*  Because our buddy JJ was screaming
*  about how two was coming back.
*  You think he's back for this?
*  I don't know.
*  Well, I'm gonna pick the Dolphins by one and a half
*  over the Cardinals at home regardless.
*  Targeting the gate. Whether he comes back or not.
*  I said two and a half, it's three.
*  No, maybe he's coming back.
*  Are you beating me right now?
*  Oh, dude.
*  Eight, two.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow, I went on a run here.
*  Fuck.
*  Eight to seven.
*  Eight to seven.
*  Yep. All right.
*  Ravens at Cleveland.
*  This is always fun.
*  No, no, if you know this, Sal,
*  but the Browns moved to Baltimore and became the Ravens.
*  What?
*  Was there like a van?
*  Don't tell me it was in the-
*  Long time ago, yeah.
*  No, a long time ago.
*  Was it in the middle of the night?
*  At least they'd had a decency to do it during the day, right?
*  Yeah.
*  I have the Ravens by three and a half.
*  I feel good about this one.
*  Wait a minute.
*  This is your biggest swing and miss of the year.
*  Ravens at Cleveland?
*  The Baltimore Ravens.
*  At Cleveland.
*  I got Ravens three and a half.
*  What is it?
*  It's nine and a half.
*  In Cleveland?
*  Yeah, in Cleveland, where they lose all their games.
*  A team that hasn't gone over their point total all year.
*  That is, that's by far my worst.
*  Well, I told you I'm on drugs right now.
*  That's it, yeah, the drugs are killing you.
*  I had nine.
*  Wait, that line's way too high.
*  The Browns have a pretty good defense.
*  Do you watch the game today?
*  They don't score.
*  No, but they don't ever score.
*  It's important in these games.
*  Nine and a half is a lot.
*  Plus they have a whole week with their new,
*  I mean, just not having Watson's worth seven points.
*  Yeah, and it is a short week for the Ravens.
*  Nick Chubb, my guy.
*  I had Nick Chubb, I have him on all my fantasy teams.
*  You kept him?
*  And each week, like a little baby bird,
*  I just, I gave him little seeds
*  and I poured water in his head
*  and I tried to grow him back to life on all my teams.
*  Didn't wave him, just kept him on, hogged the spot,
*  just waiting for my guy, my favorite fantasy player.
*  He's back.
*  This will be the week.
*  It's Nick Chubb week next week.
*  He doesn't wanna be back.
*  We just crossed his team off.
*  No, he's back.
*  He's doing it for the love of the game, so.
*  Yeah, I think there's,
*  well, they don't wanna get killed on teasers, right?
*  Cause everyone's teasing everybody who plays the Browns.
*  Like the Bengals was easy,
*  even though they covered the Browns.
*  But Bengals on a teaser.
*  I started, I had a must win in our knockout league
*  cause I snuck out a win last week,
*  but I had wide receivers.
*  I had Cupp and DJ Moore weren't playing.
*  So I was scrambling for waiver wire guys.
*  And I started Jerry Judy,
*  who didn't, they traded Amari Cooper.
*  I'm like, all right, Judy.
*  And he had no points,
*  like halfway through the fourth quarter
*  and then he finally caught like an 18 yarder.
*  But, needless to say,
*  you'll be seeing Jerry on the waiver wire on Wednesday night.
*  You're gonna beat me.
*  You're gonna win two in a row here.
*  You're a 71% favorite against me.
*  You're up eight, you're a Baker.
*  What's my win probability?
*  Is that my win probability?
*  You know, it's funny. 71%.
*  This is the one place I kind of rely on it
*  more than anything.
*  Yeah.
*  With these dumb fantasy games,
*  I don't even look at the score, but yeah.
*  71 to 29, that's a win probability.
*  Chargers home for the Saints.
*  Saints trying to lose six in a row.
*  I have the Chargers favored by three and a half.
*  Where is this game?
*  Wow.
*  Billy boy.
*  I said six, it's seven and a half.
*  All right, what is going on?
*  Well, I think you said it, you're on drugs.
*  Why are the Chargers favored by over a touchdown
*  against anybody?
*  I like the Chargers, but I mean,
*  they scored 20 points a game.
*  The Saints were so bad.
*  Like you should have your-
*  They're 10 days off.
*  They've lost five in a row.
*  Fandle taking off your phone
*  if you like the Saints after that performance.
*  That was so bad.
*  I'm falling apart.
*  Well, I'd probably hit this next one
*  because it's Broncos home for Carolina,
*  a team that has to get at least nine points or higher
*  against any team they play.
*  Broncos by nine and a half.
*  You are closer, but yeah, it's seven and a half.
*  I said four and a half, so you get that.
*  Okay.
*  So is that your, what's the three team teaser?
*  You don't trust Bo Nicks yet.
*  No, I don't.
*  You saw that overthrow, underthrow pass.
*  You loved it.
*  I think you tweeted about it.
*  It was terrific.
*  I've never seen anything like it.
*  It's beautiful.
*  Then the two guys like commiserated over it.
*  Like, I just, yeah.
*  Yeah, they quit the team.
*  They turned in their jerseys.
*  I thought he was pretty good in that game though.
*  He's not, he really has flashes.
*  Yeah, again, I don't know what that,
*  that Saints team was just a mess
*  and Peyton had that circled for years.
*  Sunday night, 49ers Cowboys.
*  Oh, this is why we do it, Mike.
*  Are you kidding me?
*  I thought Brady in the second half of that Niners game
*  sounded like if Shan Han called up to the booth
*  and said, could you start next week?
*  He was ready to do it.
*  Yeah, he was like genuinely disappointed by Purdy.
*  Yeah.
*  Interesting.
*  What could he do?
*  So if he owns, could he do all these things?
*  Could he announce and own part of the Raiders
*  and be quarterback of the 49ers?
*  What else could he do?
*  Could he play the big dom role for a team also?
*  How many different hats could he wear?
*  Could he play Silvio in a Sopranos remake?
*  I would love that.
*  Yeah. That'd be great.
*  Brady at the Bing.
*  I hate this game.
*  I hate it.
*  I have 49ers by two and a half.
*  Oh wow, I thought you'd go higher and beat me.
*  I said three and a half and it's five and a half.
*  Good luck.
*  That's too many points.
*  This is kind of, who needs this more?
*  The Niners, right?
*  I mean, I think your team needs every game.
*  You're gonna need 10 wins to make the playoffs.
*  Both of them.
*  I think both of them need it equally.
*  Gotta get to 10 wins.
*  Now it's a wild card battle for these two probably.
*  And shit, if Chicago gets to play Mariota
*  instead of Jaden Daniels, they could be five and two.
*  Yeah.
*  Like Chicago might get to 10 wins.
*  I think 10 wins is the cutoff for the NFC.
*  It's gonna frustrate me.
*  I don't wanna look at it,
*  but something tells me the Bears
*  haven't played the best of quarterbacks in their runs.
*  You know, you're right.
*  Monday night, speaking of not the best of quarterbacks,
*  the Steelers, home for the Giants.
*  And we didn't really talk about the Russell Sontz that much,
*  but he did get it going as the game went along.
*  I have Steelers by six and a half at home against the Giants.
*  I said three and a half, so I'm gonna get it.
*  It is four and a half.
*  Wow, what a demolition.
*  I'm gonna have to drug you with the encoding.
*  Maybe you found the new secret.
*  Just infect me.
*  Yeah.
*  Listen, those lines made no sense.
*  Why wouldn't the Steelers be favored by seven?
*  The Giants suck.
*  The Giants are awful.
*  We're gonna make some money this week.
*  There are some glaring errors here.
