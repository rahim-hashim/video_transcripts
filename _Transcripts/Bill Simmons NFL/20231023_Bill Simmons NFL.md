# The Ravens Will Be the Cool-Off Team in Week 8 | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [October 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c530hmmJttc)
*  All right.
*  So the Baltimore Ravens trend I noticed this year, if you go week by week, who was,
*  who had like the best game of the week and then what happened to them the following week?
*  Remember I was talking about that smoke theory.
*  So week one, it was the Niners.
*  They beat the Steelers 30 to seven.
*  I was like Niners, Niners, Niners.
*  The next week they had that really tight game in the Rams.
*  I don't think they covered, but it was like that back and forth game.
*  And I was like, Oh my God, is my T's in trouble?
*  Week two, Cowboys, Jets 30 to 10.
*  The next week you lose to the Cards.
*  Oh, week three, Dolphins 70 Broncos 20.
*  Oh, Dolphins.
*  Oh my God.
*  This offense, who's going to stop it?
*  Next week they lose to the Bills by 28.
*  Week four, the Bills, Bills 48, Dolphins 20.
*  Oh my God.
*  The Bills, best offense in the league.
*  They lose to the Jaguars next week.
*  Week five, Niners 42, Cowboys 10.
*  Holy shit.
*  Is this the best team in the league?
*  Next week they lose to Cleveland.
*  Week six, I had to struggle a little to find a week 16, but I think it was
*  Lions 20 bucks six because they were the ones where it coming out of week six.
*  People like the Lions.
*  That's a legitimate contender.
*  Stephen A had his, had them number one on his first take NFL rankings.
*  What happens?
*  They lose to the Ravens 38 to six.
*  And now this week it's Ravens time.
*  The Ravens is going to be the story of this week.
*  Lamar, Lamar Jackson is the MVP.
*  Is this the best team in the AFC?
*  Have they unleashed him offensively?
*  All these stats.
*  They're at Arizona next week.
*  They lose to the Cardinals.
*  They're at Arizona next week.
*  I don't care.
*  That's a teaser.
*  That's a teaser for me.
*  Don't care.
*  Well, I've gotten killed on teasers.
*  No, but listen, I think we're all over this though.
*  We're, we're pretty smart about this, right?
*  We like the, we like the Browns over the Niners and then Deshaun Watson screwed
*  up our thinking because he went out like on Tuesday and like, all right, well,
*  the last backup was bad for the Browns, but we're usually on this.
*  I'll say this.
*  I think this was as far as thorough acts, ass kickings from a good team to another
*  good team, I think this is one of two games that Raven's beaten the lions.
*  And the other one I really think was the Bills beating up on the dolphins.
*  And you could say the same about, about the Eagles today, but they had to pick
*  six and they just like on both sides of the ball dominating, you can maybe even
*  throw the Niners Steelers in there now, now that the Steelers are quote unquote
*  good, but those are two of the three biggest.
*  And it makes me think like, definitely don't want to face this Raven's team in
*  January right now, right now.
*  I'm saying that.
*  Well, they had 503 yards against Detroit.
*  Yeah.
*  The game felt over when it was 14 to nothing.
*  It just felt like, Oh, this is, this is the Raven's awesome Raven's game.
*  We've kind of been waiting for.
*  Uh, Dan Graziano said he wrote after the game that Lamar had 246 passing yards
*  when under duress on Sunday is the most yards under duress by any quarterback in
*  any game since Oh nine, when ESPN began tracking quarterback pressures, um, in
*  the first six games of the season, Jackson had 235 yards total under duress total.
*  I think he could sue also if you're under duress completing passes.
*  The reason I'm bringing that up is cause watching it, I, I didn't think, I thought
*  the lions were like getting pressure on him and it wasn't like they were just
*  like killing them, but the lions were actually trying to do shit.
*  Um, they couldn't really block for golf, which I was surprised by.
*  Um, but yeah, I thought Baltimore, it was so great.
*  Does a flowers thing really seems like it's an important, um, and they, you
*  know, they're using more play action and it just like the offense just seems more
*  fluid than it did all the fixes that they did over the years.
*  Um, six pass catchers over 30 yards.
*  They had 146 yards rushing, you know, Lamar went for 357, just perfect.
*  Like, like a one 55 rating and gave up zero sacks from this Detroit, you know,
*  defense and pass rush that just terrorized other teams.
*  And you're right.
*  Golf could not get going at all.
*  He couldn't.
*  He was 18 to one to win MVP golf today.
*  And I think that ship has sailed Lamar is seven to one on Fandl right now.
*  I think those are the best value odds because Hertz is up to five to one.
*  But if you've actually watched the season, I think, you know, my homes is the
*  favorite of plus two 60 and he finally got going today with Kelsey, which we'll
*  talk about in a second two is plus four 20.
*  It feels like it's narrowing a little bit now.
*  I still think it's like a dark horse at 20 to one, just in case the Jags,
*  especially with their schedule, if they just kind of rip off some wins.
*  Yeah.
*  So Lawrence has opposite of what Lamar Jackson has probably in front of him, right?
*  Lamar Jackson probably has a bunch of cold weather games.
*  You'd ever Lawrence has some indoor games in division.
*  So Lamar is going to have, he could be great and have like 160 yards passing.
*  You know, and some of these games coming up.
*  Yeah.
*  He has this kind of sneaky Arizona game.
*  That I'm just saying now, I don't like the smell of it because after that, they
*  have three straight home games, Seattle, Cleveland, Cincinnati, all at home.
*  And then they, uh, they go to LA to play the Chargers and they have a bi-week.
*  So this Arizona thing is like, come on, we'll go to Arizona.
*  We'll take care of business.
*  Then we got three at home.
*  And I really think this was part of the problem with Cleveland today.
*  I think Cleveland thought they just had to go in and I will freaking kill
*  them in shoe and it'll be fine.
*  And they were asleep from the get-go.
*  The only guy who was awake on their entire team was miles Garrett.
*  But, uh, but with the, with the Ravens.
*  So if you go winds by division, remember we were talking before the
*  year in our preview and I was like, could we get four playoff teams from the AFC
*  North? I think we had that conversation.
*  I think we each said there'd be three.
*  Yeah.
*  The angles were off.
*  They're off today and they lost the half game.
*  They lost ground.
*  Yeah.
*  Everybody has the Bengals are three and three.
*  Everyone else has a winning record.
*  AFC North has 16 wins so far, which is the most your division has 15.
*  Do you want to guess what division has the least amount of wins?
*  Uh, are you going to surprise me and say, no, it can't be the AFC West.
*  It's, uh, well, uh, the NFC South.
*  I don't know.
*  It's your least favorite division.
*  The NFC South with 10 wins total.
*  Yeah.
*  NFC North though, with 11.
*  And I gotta say, man, after watching that Packers Broncos game and losing a
*  little money on it today, that NFC North is, yeah, I thought Denver, I thought
*  Denver in the Pats, one of my betting strategies this week was Denver and the
*  Pats are now in a death race for the first pick.
*  Both of them won and both of them had a chance to lose down the stretch and
*  instead zag the other way and went for it.
*  But, uh, but yeah, the NFC, the AFC North clearly, I think the best
*  top, the bottom division.
