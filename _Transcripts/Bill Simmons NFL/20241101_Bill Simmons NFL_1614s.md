# Million-Dollar Picks Week 9 With Joe House | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [November 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI)
*  All right. House is still here. We're going to talk about some million dollar picks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=0.0s)]
*  You weren't on the last two weeks, but only because we did four and a half hours of basketball content together two weeks ago. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=2.88s)]
*  So we gave you a break that one week. Last week I was in town with all the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=8.56s)]
*  LA dudes. Now we're back. We held the fort. We're only uh, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=12.32s)]
*  somehow only won $15,000 last week, even though I thought I nailed the week. Up 178 for the year. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=16.48s)]
*  Bang. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  I think this week's really hard. There's only a couple couple that I liked, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=23.52s)]
*  but give me your favorite coming out of the gate. I want to talk about a bunch of games. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  What was, what was your favorite game of all of them? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=30.64s)]
*  It's it's a tease. I mean this week has incredible tease. I should set that up properly. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=35.68s)]
*  This is tease week. There's there's teases. There's [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=41.2s)]
*  Bill's minus minus six, Eagle's minus seven, Bangle's minus eight and a half, Chief's minus eight and a half. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=44.72s)]
*  There's some going the other way teases. So yeah. Anyway, go ahead. Yeah. I mean, I absolutely love [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=51.04s)]
*  the Chief's, you know, tease them down to two and a half home against Tampa. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=58.0s)]
*  I am today on a Monday night. I love Philly. I really think that Philly is is is going to be coming on here [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=62.720000000000006s)]
*  teasing them from seven and a half [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=68.8s)]
*  down to one and a half. I think it's very viable to tease [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=70.72s)]
*  Cleveland up from from one and a half to seven and a half because like are the Chargers going to win by margin? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=77.12s)]
*  In Cleveland, I don't think so. And then the Saints we'll see what the answer is at quarterback. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=83.52s)]
*  I wouldn't recommend doing anything with them if Rattler is the quarterback, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=89.04s)]
*  but all of the signs seem to be pointing at their card. If their car is the quarterback, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=92.72s)]
*  then we can't continue to miss out on this opportunity of winning money at Carolina's expense. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=96.56s)]
*  Like we can figure out how to do it. It could be a tease. It could be team total stuff. Might have to be first halves. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=102.16s)]
*  I did this last week where I crossed my fingers that Marcus Mariota was going to be the DC quarterback and then of course like [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=107.92s)]
*  Jada Daniels is going to play. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=114.16000000000001s)]
*  All of a sudden I did have Mariota against that Bears defense. So you mentioned the Eagles [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=116.56s)]
*  and they beat the Bengals pretty handily last week. And for me part of it was [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=122.4s)]
*  I actually took the Bengals in that game, but I thought I was getting T Higgins [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  and I thought they'd be able to throw on them all game with Jason Higgins and Higgins doesn't play. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=130.0s)]
*  But that Eagles game might have been more impressive than maybe [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=134.4s)]
*  maybe I gave it credit for in the moment because I was so mad about the Higgins thing. Like maybe the Eagles are pretty good. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=138.72s)]
*  I feel like we've also been down this road before where it's like time to trust the Eagles and then they completely kick you in the nuts. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  But as we talked about with Danny, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=150.08s)]
*  it just feels like this Jag season's over. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=152.4s)]
*  That trade they made traded their left tackle. I know he wasn't playing that great, but that was just really weird. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=155.36s)]
*  They're like, ah, we got some other guys like nobody has other guys sitting on the bench to play left tackle. That's crazy. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=160.08s)]
*  Brian Thomas is hurt. Might not be able to play. ETN has been hurt the whole season. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=166.4s)]
*  Kirk is out. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=171.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, Kirk's done for the year. It just feels like the Eagles and the Tees at home [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=174.16s)]
*  feels pretty safe to me. They're going to be able to run. Maybe Peterson coming back there. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=179.68s)]
*  This would be like the nail in the coffin for that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=184.16s)]
*  So I'm with you on that. And then Chief's Bucks was the other one that it's like that number is nine is eight and a half [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=186.8s)]
*  still so you can get it to two and a half. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  The Bucks with no with no Godwin, no Evans last week Mayfield was still moving the ball because who he was playing but [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=194.88s)]
*  the receivers aren't the same. Their defense is awful. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  And I just don't see are they this is going to be the team that ends Casey's unbeaten season [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  on a Monday night. I don't see it. No, and remember the difference between Baker under pressure and Baker not under pressure. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=209.04000000000002s)]
*  Atlanta can has the worst pass rush in the entire NFL. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  And so Baker was, you know, trying to wheel and deal as best he could. They were competitive for as long as [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=219.52s)]
*  as he could keep them in there. This is this this Chiefs thing is a radically different animal. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=224.56s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=230.88s)]
*  And their defense is bad. Tampa's D. You can move the ball and then you can do whatever all the all the advanced stats on them are bad. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  All right, so we have two. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=240.32s)]
*  I don't trust the Bengals against the Raiders. That was another one I really wanted to put in, but I don't know what's going to happen with Higgins. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=242.48s)]
*  The Raiders feel like they're good for one stupid weird out of nowhere win every eight weeks there to have one against Baltimore. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=249.28s)]
*  They're kind of do I think that's a stay away. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=255.92s)]
*  The Bills against the Dolphins is a possible tease. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=259.52s)]
*  So they they killed them in week two even before two got hurt. They have a much better team. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=263.36s)]
*  Dolphins have had a bunch of injuries already, especially on defense. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=268.48s)]
*  Um, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=272.32s)]
*  And yet something's holding me back on it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=274.48s)]
*  Is this a kitchen sink game for the Dolphins? They're not kind of out of the playoffs yet. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=277.28s)]
*  Somebody's going to make the playoffs at nine and eight in the AFC. Like they're not done yet. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=282.24s)]
*  It probably is a kitchen sink game for the Dolphins, but if um, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=286.4s)]
*  Dopey McDaniel, the the disc jockey is standing at the sink. I don't want any part of it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=291.6s)]
*  Uh, the Bills own the Dolphins. JJ said so on our East Coast Bias program. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=296.24s)]
*  Um, Tua is one in seven against uh, the Bills. The Bills just scheme against the Dolphins [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=302.32s)]
*  wonderfully. The Dolphins don't have any answer for it. Um, and it you know, we'll see they they had no pass rush whatsoever. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=309.34s)]
*  The Dolphins last they were up 10 points against the Cardinals at home and could not get that across the goal line. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=316.0s)]
*  That is that's diabolical how bad that is that you can't hold on. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=322.15999999999997s)]
*  But they couldn't get any any pass rush because the what's his name? Sylert? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=327.36s)]
*  Uh is hurt and I don't know if he's gonna be back this week. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=331.12s)]
*  That's the wrong set of circumstances to go up to Buffalo and try and the line [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=334.56s)]
*  Um has gone from six and a half down to five and a half. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=340.0s)]
*  So some folks are are interested in in Miami. I am not I am not one of the people interested in Miami. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=343.59999999999997s)]
*  And i'm just fine with you know, Buffalo as a money line leg. I don't want to tease, you know through the zero really. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=349.2s)]
*  There's no value there, but you know, um, I think the bills are going to handle their business. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=356.64s)]
*  So if we're looking at teases, it's eagles. It may be just eagles and chiefs and that's it. That'd be fine. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=361.11999999999995s)]
*  I'd be perfectly satisfied with that. Um, some maybe bets. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=367.03999999999996s)]
*  The [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=373.52s)]
*  Colts we talked about earlier plus five and a half against the Vikings and that feels like that should be a three-point game [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=374.88s)]
*  But I also as I said earlier like the flacco going against [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=380.4s)]
*  Flores and that Vikings D also the Vikings two losses in a row [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=384.72s)]
*  10 days rest [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=388.96s)]
*  Um, people seem to think oh now that they flacco's in there with the colts. Everything's gonna be fine, but [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=390.72s)]
*  Something's telling me to stay away from this, but I just wanted to make sure you felt the same way [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=396.8s)]
*  Yeah, I the back door is open and that's the reason to be nervous [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=401.04s)]
*  And so that you know some smart people like i've seen and heard folks making a good argument a compelling argument for taking [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=405.12s)]
*  Minnesota on the first half line, which I kind of like it's like [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=411.52s)]
*  around three or so [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=415.36s)]
*  Uh for them to cover whatever three and a half maybe i'm totally fine with that idea like minnesota coming in after that loss against [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=417.04s)]
*  The ramps with that extra time against this colts team that you know is trying to save its season [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=424.0s)]
*  um, but minnesota showing one again like [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=430.88s)]
*  We're class. We're this is it [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=434.15999999999997s)]
*  We're a class team in the first half and then in the second half [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=435.84s)]
*  Flacco does some of the stuff that flacco does so that would be a reason to stay away from the whole game [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=439.52s)]
*  Yeah [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=444.71999999999997s)]
*  The bears are plus one and a half in arizona and I know they're on they might be on your dnb list [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=446.08s)]
*  But they are I was really impressed by their defense that the the defensive stats with them are great [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=451.28s)]
*  Like they're they're a top six or seven defense by any calculation at this point [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=457.44s)]
*  and [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=463.2s)]
*  Arizona as a favorite just in general arizona with any hint of prosperity makes me nervous [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=464.32s)]
*  Arizona's four and four they barely beat the chargers that that one time right? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=470.56s)]
*  Yeah, that I mean they the chargers really should have won that game, right? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=475.68s)]
*  So that just immediately makes them three and five [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=478.88s)]
*  They had that weird comeback against miami that they somehow won the game. I had taken that off of tv [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=481.52s)]
*  So i'm just not sure they feel like a four and four team to me [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=486.4s)]
*  so [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=490.88s)]
*  Just staring at it going. Ah, i'm trying to talk myself into the bears, but I think you're right. I think they're a dnb [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=492.4s)]
*  Yeah, they're they're wins. They have three wins in our last four games are three in one again [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=498.23999999999995s)]
*  They beat the 49ers by one point [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=504.88s)]
*  They beat the chargers by two points and they beat the dolphins by one point and they got smacked by by the packers [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=507.2s)]
*  they got smashed by uh, the [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=514.48s)]
*  uh [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=517.92s)]
*  The bills well the bills actually [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=518.96s)]
*  Um did it in the second half, but in any event they're too inconsistent [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=521.2800000000001s)]
*  um, I just can't under any circumstances have anything to do with that bears coaching staff because they have shown us without any [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=525.52s)]
*  Uh hesitation or reservation they will snatch the feet right the f out of the jaws of victory. I heard that [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=534.32s)]
*  I heard that eberfluss was um [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=540.48s)]
*  Was uh [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=543.52s)]
*  Working a little background for the yankees during the world series [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=544.88s)]
*  About base running and defense amazing giving them some tips. He was an unpaid, uh consultant [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=548.2399999999999s)]
*  I took a picture of all of the the errors and the base running [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=554.88s)]
*  Miscues and all of that and I and I thought long and hard about sending it to the to the group text to jj last [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=559.5s)]
*  Night and I didn't do it because I love jj. I'm gonna save it for this weekend [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=565.3599999999999s)]
*  I'm definitely gonna send it the yankee fans moved into a weird thing where they they immediately were like I knew this was gonna happen [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=569.04s)]
*  Me fuck where and just they did the finger pointing thing and it's like you [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=575.68s)]
*  You definitely didn't know it was gonna happen when judge homered in the first inning you're up to nothing and you were like, yeah [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=579.28s)]
*  That's right, man our house. We're not going down here [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=583.68s)]
*  Brown's chargers browns plus one and a half at home [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=588.2399999999999s)]
*  Against the chargers and I like the browns a lot more before the defensive injuries [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=592.0s)]
*  I think i'm i'm i've landed as a stay away on this one. I'm with you on it. It'll be fun [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=596.0s)]
*  I'm gonna root for the browns. Um, it will be a good [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=601.04s)]
*  uh measuring [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=604.8000000000001s)]
*  Tape game for the chargers because if we if the chargers are legit then they better go [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=606.32s)]
*  They should be able to move the ball in this game even though the guys are on. Yeah, right i'm with you [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=611.12s)]
*  lions packers packers are plus two and a half at home [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=616.0s)]
*  Oh two and a half [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=619.84s)]
*  Plus two and a half looks like jordan loves playing so that yeah because it was three and a half yesterday [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=621.9200000000001s)]
*  So the line is moving in the direction of like we're we're feeling stronger about the idea that jordan loves going to play [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=626.4000000000001s)]
*  I think he's going to play [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=632.0s)]
*  That's my take knowing nothing and having no contacts in the packers organization [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=633.92s)]
*  And you know these all the teams lie now [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=638.56s)]
*  They wait until they try and get advantages as they should but like you you we really don't know who's playing in any games [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=640.56s)]
*  until 12 55 on sunday [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=646.24s)]
*  I will say this [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=648.56s)]
*  I think we have a better sense now on the thursday friday with the practice and what's released on [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=650.3199999999999s)]
*  What feels doable and not doable like even the daniels thing last week [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=656.4799999999999s)]
*  On thursday, it was like all right. He's not written off yet and they're not saying he's out which makes me think he's probably [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=660.7199999999999s)]
*  Going to play you just have to you're basically turning into matlock trying to figure it out [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=666.8s)]
*  It's it's true. But like who had puka and cooper playing right? Right? That's true [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=672.0799999999999s)]
*  So lions on grass is [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=678.7199999999999s)]
*  The lions on grass outdoors would be the fear [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=681.36s)]
*  The counter would be you're getting the lions under a field goal and they're the best team in the league and why wouldn't you just take that? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=684.48s)]
*  They're going to run the ball all over green bay and do some play action stuff and the counter that would be well no james and williams [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=689.76s)]
*  You know take out st. Brown packers have a good secondary [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=697.52s)]
*  To me, it's a stay away. I want to watch it. I don't I don't think I need money on it [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=701.6s)]
*  Or I can go packers and atis. Yeah, i'm playing [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=705.84s)]
*  Packers money line [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=709.84s)]
*  I'm playing [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=711.9200000000001s)]
*  Packers money line packers entities. Look at the weather forecast [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=713.12s)]
*  What is it? Precipitation right now high of 52 degrees winds 15 miles an hour or more [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=718.38s)]
*  precipitation [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=725.5s)]
*  likelihood 60 percent or higher [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=726.86s)]
*  At game time, you know, I don't like playing in those weather conditions [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=729.6800000000001s)]
*  Jared effing golf, you know, whose first outdoor game of the nfl season [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=734.48s)]
*  Is this coming sunday bill simmons? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=740.48s)]
*  Jared effing golf [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=743.0200000000001s)]
*  You know what the numbers show about jared golf in outdoor games. That's one thing [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=745.44s)]
*  I think he's around a 500 quarterback. All of his numbers are dramatically lower in terms of completion percentages [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=751.9200000000001s)]
*  Accuracy all that kind of advanced stuff put some precipitation in the mix put some adverse weather conditions into the mix [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=758.46s)]
*  Add that filter to the jared golf scenario and then and then see now look you [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=766.0799999999999s)]
*  Can one could make a very compelling case? I would listen to it of detroit trying to run the ball because they have a multi-headed [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=772.3199999999999s)]
*  rush attack and they have an extraordinary offensive line and if you want to make that case i'll listen and and not dismiss it [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=781.1999999999999s)]
*  out of hand, but the [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=789.3599999999999s)]
*  Lions are not going to be able to put pressure [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=792.4s)]
*  On jordan love and the packers that the the the hutchinson thing is really going to be felt this so you're going [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=796.3199999999999s)]
*  You're going bad weather [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=803.36s)]
*  golf outdoors with some some things going against them lambo [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=805.52s)]
*  crazy crowd [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=810.24s)]
*  Crazy crowd, maybe they stuff the lions run a little bit. Yeah lack of a second receiver. All right [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=811.84s)]
*  I'm just talking it. I just want to make sure the considerations are out there [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=819.1999999999999s)]
*  I hate going against the lions, but I understand they're they have the best against the spread record of any team in the last three years [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=822.4s)]
*  We got the t's could be in the way t's the pack up [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=830.64s)]
*  T's the pack up packers minus two and a half is plus 148 [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=834.8s)]
*  Wait what packers minus two and a half is plus 148. Yeah, I want it to be more than that [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=841.04s)]
*  Okay [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=846.88s)]
*  There I want a better price for that straight money line is plus 124. Yeah, okay [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=848.4s)]
*  I to me if the weather is going to be super weird and wonky the over under is out for me [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=854.24s)]
*  Sure. Sure. Yeah, i'm not in here trying to argue for a total one way or the other [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=859.6s)]
*  I think the packers tease two and a half up to eight and a half [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=865.12s)]
*  Even though we know that detroit's capable of winning by margin not in these kind of matchups [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=868.64s)]
*  Not in this matchup not it all depends on love [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=874.08s)]
*  Obviously things can change but if love is a go I like the packers [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=877.52s)]
*  Well, we don't know if love is a go which should be a reason to maybe not do anything with this game [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=882.4s)]
*  What if they decide on sunday that he's not playing and malik willis is somehow in our lives then we we lose money [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=887.12s)]
*  That's what happens [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=892.96s)]
*  Although malik willis, you know in his limited sample size leflore [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=894.48s)]
*  Leflore is incredible. Let's just give him some flowers so that he hears it [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=899.6s)]
*  broncos [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=904.64s)]
*  Are plus eight and a half [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=906.16s)]
*  in baltimore [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=908.64s)]
*  Baltimore is still having some cornerback health issues [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=911.28s)]
*  Sean paten, I heard back doors always open in baltimore lord have mercy the back door is always open [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=915.68s)]
*  Kind of like the broncos [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=923.04s)]
*  Here's the issue I do think marlon humphrey's back I do think the backup um for him that also missed last week is back as well [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=926.4s)]
*  and [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=934.24s)]
*  Even with the issues that that um baltimore has on defense [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=935.44s)]
*  The idea of bow nix going into baltimore and you know the the thing that that denver has done with with great success [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=940.64s)]
*  Is is throw the ball that that kid in his last six games has at least four games over 200 yards passing [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=949.44s)]
*  Uh mate mate and and you know against the panthers now again the the panthers are our d league. That's not um [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=956.88s)]
*  A legit measuring stick but they went away from the run neither one of their running backs [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=964.24s)]
*  I think got to even 50 yards again against the panthers [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=968.96s)]
*  They're gonna have to try and establish the run against baltimore except for baltimore is the best rush run defense in the league [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=972.48s)]
*  um, and then I do think that that even with what we've seen out of baltimore, um in terms of its secondary the vulnerabilities there I [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=979.04s)]
*  I'm I don't know man. I I like I don't not [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=987.84s)]
*  Under any circumstances advocating laying eight and a half because we just can't trust [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=991.52s)]
*  Baltimore to keep that door shut in the fourth quarter, but that's another great teaser eight half down to two and a half for baltimore [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=997.02s)]
*  You don't like that what if I gave you denver up to 11 and a half [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1004.7199999999999s)]
*  With the over adjusted at 38 and a half [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1010.0799999999999s)]
*  And that was plus 103 I love the over the over part of it is not an issue for me [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1014.48s)]
*  Baltimore can win by margin baltimore [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1021.04s)]
*  They that's that's the best offense [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1023.76s)]
*  I think their offense is better this year than last year and they had that offense last year made lamar an mvp [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1027.04s)]
*  We disagree and i'm crossing it up, okay, okay, I think I think both of us could be right [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1035.76s)]
*  I do like sean payton against that ravens team [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1040.24s)]
*  I also could see the ravens just running all over them and the broncos have had an easy schedule and you'd be like god [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1042.72s)]
*  Damn it. Why didn't I realize this was gonna happen? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1047.36s)]
*  All right, my two favorites [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1050.32s)]
*  And i'm probably [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1053.52s)]
*  The falcons cowboys game which now is falcons minus three. Oh, it's moving [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1055.84s)]
*  Yeah move from minus two and a half to minus three and I love the falcons because I think dallas sucks [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1061.4399999999998s)]
*  Wow, I think they stink. Wow [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1068.08s)]
*  And yet this is the perfect team for them to play [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1071.6s)]
*  Because atlanta does have a pass rush [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1075.52s)]
*  Exactly [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1077.76s)]
*  And dac can just throw the ball basically every down he can and hang in the game [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1078.8799999999999s)]
*  He can still think the falcons are going to win [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1084.56s)]
*  Okay, but I also think we're gonna have a lot of points and my question is [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1087.28s)]
*  Is there could you do some chicannery with this one? Where do you stand on the game? First of all? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1092.4s)]
*  um, I agree with the latter half of of your thesis I do think that [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1097.12s)]
*  Uh, the cowboys are going to move the ball and there is with dakota with dac as quarterback coming off of a loss [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1101.44s)]
*  Um, they're very good as underdogs and and they're good as road underdogs his record as as a dog coming off of a loss [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1108.96s)]
*  Is like in the 60 range [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1115.68s)]
*  um under some of these these sort of circumstances that we're [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1118.32s)]
*  We're measuring and are relevant to this. Um, the fact that atlanta can't get home with a pass rush at all [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1122.24s)]
*  And here's the the concern I would have if you wagered on [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1128.8000000000002s)]
*  Atlanta we watched dallas go into pittsburgh on a sunday night game and pittsburgh really couldn't get home [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1132.72s)]
*  Uh at all and dac well, they had they had some injuries they did they back picked that defense apart [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1139.68s)]
*  And it was with a bunch of dudes that coming into that game [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1145.76s)]
*  You know tolbert had the game-winning touchdown with incredible finger strength like, you know terpon factored into that [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1148.64s)]
*  Uh, the second string tight end, you know, I I just think that that it's uh, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1154.96s)]
*  It's a susceptible spot. I do like the idea of points in this game though because cousins, um, and and these weapons really have been [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1161.12s)]
*  meshing [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1168.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, what if I gave you [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1170.6399999999999s)]
*  What what adjusted over under would excite you? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1173.52s)]
*  What do you mean in terms of a total [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1177.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, like what if I was able to get this to 45 and a half? [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1180.0s)]
*  I I mean i'm fine with that over I don't have any issue with that over [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1184.64s)]
*  Because you could do a little adjusted dallas plus seven and a half with the over of 45 and a half [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1188.24s)]
*  Okay, okay, and that's basically even odds minus one. Okay. Yeah good [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1193.44s)]
*  Then we root for points right and dallas to hang around love it [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1198.0800000000002s)]
*  That's a good one. The thing that worries me is atlanta running the ball on them [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1202.4s)]
*  And just like just running the fucking shit out of the ball and dallas never has the ball because atlanta always has the ball [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1206.16s)]
*  Fair enough, I think that was gonna throw I had that pittsburgh game in my head too if you give dac time [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1212.4s)]
*  He just moves the butt. He moves the chains. He finds dudes [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1218.24s)]
*  And that's kind of what you have to do against atlanta [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1221.76s)]
*  That's what everybody that's beating them is just throwing the ball on them and move the ball down the field on them [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1223.8400000000001s)]
*  All right, so dallas plus seven and a half [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1228.72s)]
*  Maybe I could get that over under to [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1232.96s)]
*  I wonder if I could [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1235.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1237.3600000000001s)]
*  You could do a basic tease again, you're not supposed to tease totals [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1238.48s)]
*  But if you tease dallas up to nine and that totaled down to 46 and a half, I mean, uh 45 and a half [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1241.76s)]
*  Yeah [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1248.64s)]
*  Now we do that that's a minus that's a minus [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1250.72s)]
*  Uh 120 tees. It's not the same price as the price that you have at seven and a half [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1254.08s)]
*  That's what you get. That's even odds. That's a better price. Yeah, so we'll do that. Okay [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1259.44s)]
*  So [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1264.24s)]
*  So dallas seven and a half and then we get to root for dallas and get mad if they fuck us [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1265.44s)]
*  Who are sent mad text to cuz and to raheem? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1270.72s)]
*  With the over of 45 and a half [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1274.56s)]
*  And that's minus 108 [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1278.08s)]
*  Great [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1280.4s)]
*  Better than a good one. Yeah, and then we love the rams against the seahawks [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1281.44s)]
*  We need to talk that one out [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1286.24s)]
*  I don't know. I mean it's it's it's cooper cup these nuts [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1288.32s)]
*  On the field like an amazing opportunity for this rams team with their offensive line [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1292.32s)]
*  And seattle's down the vibes are bad. You heard danny [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1298.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you can see they've lost four their last five their defense is 29th against the run [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1302.48s)]
*  and uh [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1308.0s)]
*  This feels very ramsey to puka and and cup these nuts [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1309.84s)]
*  I love that combo. I also like stafford as a road qb [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1314.8799999999999s)]
*  As do I not giving a shit about not not [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1319.44s)]
*  All right, and we're staying away from the bears [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1324.0s)]
*  That's my humble opinion dream is one of his favorite bets I understand the thesis [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1327.6000000000001s)]
*  I just can't be in the situation [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1333.1200000000001s)]
*  Of needing the bears to close out a game and watching those dunderheads. I mean it it like took [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1335.7600000000002s)]

*  Miraculous moronics for for chicago to give that game away [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1347.26s)]
*  The the handoff to the offensive lineman [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1352.0s)]
*  Seriously, one of the the dumbest plays of the decade. I want chicago to lose [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1355.02s)]
*  For the rest of this season so that I can buy them to win the super bowl next year [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1361.2s)]
*  When mike rable is the quarterback? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1365.84s)]
*  I mean the the coach when mike rable comes in with all with his coaching staff [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1367.6000000000001s)]
*  With the talent that the bears have on both sides of the ball that team is talented [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1371.76s)]
*  But those those big dummies and you know, the players hold their coaches in contempt [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1376.24s)]
*  It was hilarious. One of my favorite undercurrents of hard knocks this season was the dumb dumb eberfluss [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1383.4399999999998s)]
*  making uh kaleb williams go sit with him in his office and act like they're having one-on-one conversations and kaleb williams could [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1391.1s)]
*  Barely hide his disdain for for dummy eberfluss. I mean, I just enjoyed it so much [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1400.0s)]
*  But here we are those chickens have come home to roost. Um, he'll be a fine defensive coordinator somewhere by the way good defense [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1405.36s)]

*  On a bunch of stuff which I think is usually a bad sign [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1432.72s)]
*  Um, I do I do wish the tennessee line was like two and a half because I would take them against the pets [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1436.16s)]
*  Ah, I kind of like the past. I can't imagine the past would win two games in a row. I kind of like the paths [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1441.6s)]
*  Well, we'll see if drake may plays around. All right, right. It's time [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uM8Zz_MiI&t=1447.92s)]
