# The Vibes Are Off With the Chiefs | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [December 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rzyV-YYHIQ)
*  Chiefs Raiders, which I gotta be honest,
*  I just thought the Chiefs defense
*  would win this game by itself,
*  and the Chiefs would just kinda have the ball a lot,
*  wouldn't be that fun of a game.
*  It came out at 10 o'clock in the morning West Coast time.
*  Just seemed like your classic,
*  it's nine to nothing in the third quarter,
*  and the Raiders have 50 yards rushing.
*  That's kinda what the game was,
*  except for the Chiefs offense part.
*  The Raiders, what was that stat?
*  When was Aiden O'Connell's last completion?
*  Was it like?
*  First quarter.
*  In first quarter, that was it.
*  But the Chiefs.
*  They had nine completions the whole game.
*  Bizarre game.
*  What did they do?
*  4.2 yards per play for the Chiefs,
*  and I thought the body language was,
*  we're taping this as the Suns are playing the Mavericks
*  right now, the Suns have the worst body language
*  in the NBA right now, have been a good team.
*  The Chiefs body language, I can't tell if it's,
*  we have married couples in our lives who are like,
*  oh, they're fighting again, but it feels like a bit.
*  Deep down, they love each other.
*  And then there's the married couples where you're like,
*  oh man, they're fighting again, this is fucking awkward.
*  I know Bob might be sleeping on our living room couch tonight.
*  To me, the Chiefs have more married couple
*  that still loves each other fighting energy,
*  but the body language is awful.
*  So funny you say that.
*  My wife and I think of that just by looking
*  at the Christmas cards, we could tell.
*  The body language, we didn't have to see them
*  at the party, but.
*  Christmas card body language doctor.
*  Just analyzing the cards, but yeah, you're right, man.
*  They were awful, he's running for his life,
*  he had to make every play work.
*  I thought Romo called a good game,
*  and I was like, he's gonna have to make it work
*  with his legs if they're gonna win this.
*  And yet, the Raiders didn't score an offensive point,
*  and they won that game, didn't complete a pass.
*  If you saw that box score, how much would you have put
*  on the Chiefs' money line?
*  It was one of those where you could have gone
*  and quickly take a shower, and you come back,
*  and the Raiders have 15 more points, or whatever that is.
*  What happened?
*  I've made this point before,
*  but I'm gonna make it more strongly now.
*  This Chiefs team really reminds me of Brady's last season
*  with the Pats, where it all looked the same,
*  structurally it was the same, Belichick, Brady,
*  the Pats had just won the Super Bowl,
*  and we kinda knew something was wrong
*  the entire second half of the season,
*  but didn't wanna admit it.
*  Then they lost the Fitzpatrick game.
*  Pats were 12 and four that year.
*  They lost in round one, 20 to 13 in Tennessee.
*  Casey's nine and six this year.
*  The Pats lost, they went four and four in their last eight,
*  including the playoff game.
*  The Chiefs are three and five in their last eight,
*  which is, I couldn't believe that when I was like,
*  man, they're probably 500 in their last eight,
*  it's worse, they're three and five.
*  The Pats had the crap running backs,
*  it was like Sonya Michelle, Rex Burkhead,
*  the last years of James Waite.
*  Chiefs, same thing, it's just, you know,
*  it's like, oh my God, Isaiah Pacheco's out.
*  This is like a huge thing for them.
*  They had no Tyreek this year.
*  Pats didn't have Gronk, because that was the year he retired.
*  Edelman is kinda the Kelsey of that Pats team.
*  And then the rest of the Pats receivers,
*  it was like Philip Dorsett, washed up Josh Gordon,
*  Jacobi Meyers was a rookie.
*  That was the year they thought they were gonna get
*  Antonio Brown, and it fell through,
*  and it just reminds me of that,
*  where Mahomes had really great moments in the game today,
*  but his receivers are never open,
*  and he's just buying himself eight, nine, 10 seconds,
*  and it just doesn't matter.
*  And to me, it's not an overreaction to say,
*  I just think this team, I just don't think they have it.
*  To me, this is a let's bet against them
*  round one situation, officially.
*  Yeah, I'm with you.
*  I thought going into this week, I'm like, all right,
*  you know, Andy Reid, smart, maybe like Popovich,
*  you know, maybe my basketball talk,
*  but maybe he's like, he knows.
*  I knew you'd bring basketball in.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  By the way, I didn't even know
*  there was a game going on now.
*  Should we postpone it?
*  Should we watch that?
*  I don't have time.
*  Maverick's game?
*  Yeah, no, it's fine.
*  I'm taking it.
*  But no, I was thinking like Andy Reid,
*  maybe he's learned, and it's like, all right,
*  we don't wanna peak too early,
*  which is what some of these teams do.
*  So they'll turn it on today.
*  I thought it was the day they would turn it on.
*  I honestly don't think Mahomes is confident
*  going to any of those receivers.
*  He had a head start with Kaderi's Tony being out.
*  He didn't have to worry about that disaster show.
*  But even so, they did nothing offensively, really bad.
*  The Pats receiving yards that year, Edelman had 1,100.
*  So that's basically where Kelsey's gonna end up.
*  Their second receiver, the 2019 Pats,
*  was James White with 645 yards.
*  Right.
*  Dorsett, 397.
*  Chikopi Meyers, 359.
*  Josh Gordon, 287.
*  And they traded for Mohamed Sanou midseason.
*  He gave them 207.
*  When you don't have the weapons, you don't have the weapons.
*  To me, I was thinking in my head,
*  this is more like the 2006 Pats,
*  where Brady dragged them to the AFC title game with nobody.
*  It feels more like 2019.
*  They don't have it.
*  They had a great run.
*  This is a five-year run, but somebody's gonna beat them.
*  The way that-
*  I still don't really get it,
*  because they won a Super Bowl without Tyree Kill, right?
*  So I don't, it doesn't completely add up,
*  except it all just goes away at once.
*  Well, Kelsey's worse, there's no question.
*  Yeah.
*  He's worse.
*  He's not getting open in the same ways.
*  And I don't know, they just,
*  they seemed a little more banged up on both sides.
*  They've had some injury luck.
*  And I don't think they hit the draft this year
*  the same way.
*  Last year, they crushed a draft,
*  and all those dudes were helping right away.
*  It doesn't seem like they've had the same success this year.
*  You think if you asked Kelsey
*  if he could be himself from 2020,
*  or himself from this year, what would he say?
*  Does he get Taylor Swift this year?
*  No, no.
*  He's himself from 2020.
*  I think he'd probably be in a better position.
*  Oh, you backstabbed.
*  So he doesn't have Taylor Swift in 2020.
*  No Taylor Swift, but he's a good football player.
*  He's super happy.
*  He's a two-time champion, and he's dating Taylor Swift.
*  All right.
*  He's taking right now.
*  I wish I had known that.
*  Man, I don't know how much more I wanna do this
*  when he whipped the helmet down.
