# Are the Pats Setting Another Rookie QB Up to Fail? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [March 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is5cs8dVtXc)
*  So they've been from a spending standpoint, the worst team in the league,
*  the last 10 years for the amount of money that they've spent.
*  Last year, they were 30th and spending at 188 million.
*  The Browns spent 282 million over the last 10 years, according to ESPN's
*  roster management system, they've spent 1.62 billion in players, which is
*  dead last in the NFL and Philadelphia spent 1.92 billion.
*  Now you can twist some of this stuff around because some of the spending
*  stuff, you know, you can miss on free agents, you can guarantee a ton of money.
*  You can push money backwards where eventually you're going to get crushed.
*  Like the Saints did a couple of years ago, like the Denver's getting crushed
*  this year, so it doesn't necessarily mean cut and dry.
*  This team loves to spend money and this team doesn't, but it does say something
*  because they had Tom Brady, who has basically taken a discount every year
*  every year because, you know, he wanted to win, he wanted to put the money back
*  into the team and yet now we have all this evidence they didn't put the money back
*  in the team.
*  They were 31st and spending for seasons in 2020, 2014, and then they were 32nd
*  last year.
*  Then this year they walked into a free agency with just a shitload of money.
*  They resigned a couple of their role player free agents, plus Kyle Dugger
*  and Michael Anwenu.
*  They brought Henry back, Kendrick Bourne, Anthony Jennings and Josh Uche.
*  And then they signed a bunch of like, you know, role player free agents,
*  Antonio Gibson, really good third down back, KJ Osborne, Fun Nav in the Slat,
*  Jacoby Brissette, good stop gap quarterback for a year if you want to go
*  six and 11, on and on and on.
*  They still have like $47 million to spend.
*  And now I'm leaning toward the cheap because Gerard Mayo said the new coach
*  that the Pats would be ready to burn some cash in free agency and they just didn't.
*  And here's why this bothers me.
*  If you want to throw away this year and you want to say, Hey, you know, a year
*  from now we have a bunch of free agents coming up.
*  They got to figure out, pay Christian Barmore and a bunch of people.
*  And it's like, this would be a stop gap year for us.
*  Well, we just had a stop gap year.
*  We went four and 13.
*  That's one thing.
*  The other thing is they're almost definitely going to be a free agency.
*  They're almost definitely.
*  And I want to talk about May versus Daniels in a second.
*  They're almost a hundred percent chance they're getting Drake, May or
*  Jayden Danos as their quarterback.
*  Why wouldn't they want a foundation for those guys to walk into either one of them
*  where you at least have one good receiver, where you have a left tackle.
*  You just have the basic necessities you need to succeed as a rookie
*  quarterback if he's going to play.
*  Now, if they don't think he's going to play as a rookie, whether it's
*  Mayor Daniels and it's Brissette, that's fine.
*  But it just seems like the team's going to suck again.
*  And there were little moves like Keenan Allen.
*  He cost the fourth round pick.
*  Do I think Keenan Allen's going to be in the team seven years from now?
*  No, but at least he's competent.
*  Mike Williams, Tyler Boyd, two really productive receivers who are still
*  available right now, who probably cost eight to 10 million, isn't it
*  worth getting one of them?
*  What scares me is they're putting whoever this quarterback is in a position of
*  fail because it's a new coach with a coaching staff of a bunch of people who
*  were like the eighth to 12th choice that I think they had initially people that.
*  I don't think anybody around the league has been wowed by the coaching hires.
*  And then you're putting them on a team with no weapons and you just kind of have
*  to keep your fingers crossed that it's going to work out.
*  And we have seen this happen with the NFL over and over and over again,
*  like look at fields.
*  We're about to talk about fields with Jason Goff.
*  Like you put somebody who's talented in the wrong spot and it could just backfire.
*  And I think all this team should care about is can we put our franchise QB
*  in a position to succeed?
*  The thing that really scares me is that they might trade out of three for a lot
*  of picks and then they can talk about it.
*  Here's how smart we are.
*  We got two first rounders and first rounder next year and we're going to
*  build from the ground up.
*  It's like, do I trust any of these people to build from ground up?
*  We have a new GM, we have an 82 year old owner and we have a brand new head coach.
*  I just want the franchise QB, which leads to the third thing.
*  May versus Daniel's, which I'm obviously obsessed with because I keep bringing up
*  on pods, but it's so fascinating to me how split it is between the two guys and all
*  the mocks, like the mocks are coming out.
*  Like we have our ringer mock draft.
*  We did Danny Kelly has Daniel's second and May 3rd.
*  Kuyper just put out one.
*  Daniel's the second, May's third.
*  Field Yates, NESPN, Daniel's the second, May's third.
*  Daniel Jeremiah, incredibly well respected.
*  He has May 2nd, Daniel's third.
*  Then Nate Tice puts out his big board.
*  I like Nate Tice.
*  He had May 1A.
*  He basically had May 1A and Caleb Williams 1B as prospects.
*  He had Jaden Daniels 19th and you know, he didn't kill him because he still has
*  him as a top 20 prospect, but he's like, I'm worried about this.
*  I'm worried about this.
*  I'm worried about this.
*  I'm in a position now where I've, I'm kind of landing on Drake May as the
*  guy I want them to get because 230 pounds, the upside, he feels Josh Allen.
*  And maybe I'm worried about Daniel's is going to get hurt, but I also want to keep
*  my options open in case may go second to Washington and we get Daniel's third.
*  And then I have to go, no, I love Daniel's the whole time.
*  All right.
*  This is really wrecking me.
*  I, we haven't had Patriots haven't had a top pick in 30 years.
*  I've just haven't gone through all the, all the stages of talking myself
*  into stuff, getting swayed by mock drafts.
*  Uh, it's been, it's been pretty fun to watch.
