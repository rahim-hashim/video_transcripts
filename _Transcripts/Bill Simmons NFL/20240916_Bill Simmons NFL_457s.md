# Bryce Young Got Benched, And Steven Ruiz Predicted It | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4)
*  Carolina is minus 60 already for the season. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=0.0s)]
*  We have 15 games left. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=3.12s)]
*  They're at minus 60. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=4.2s)]
*  They've scored 13 points. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=5.16s)]
*  Benching Bryce, shout out again to Steven Ruiz on my pod a month ago. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=8.28s)]
*  This was one of his hottest takes that he thought Bryce Young would get benched [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=12.32s)]
*  this season. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=15.4s)]
*  It is time for the number one hottest take from Steven Ruiz. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=16.36s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=19.16s)]
*  What is it? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=19.56s)]
*  Bryce Young gets benched this year. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=20.6s)]
*  And at the end of the season, we all agree that he's QB4 in this class. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=22.64s)]
*  Maybe QB5. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=26.16s)]
*  Or in his class. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=28.48s)]
*  Bryce Young gets benched halfway through this. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=30.36s)]
*  It's that bad where they're just like, we have to get this guy off the field and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=34.28s)]
*  reset and try to figure out what happened here. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=38.88s)]
*  It's the Zach Wilson thing where you frame it as like, we need him to take a [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=40.96s)]
*  step back and be able to see things from the outside in. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=44.16s)]
*  We got Andy Dalton here. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  He's a capable veteran who can kind of show him the ropes. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=47.92s)]
*  Secretly, Andy Dalton was the only quarterback who really performed well [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  when he got to play last year. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=54.16s)]
*  We had the same supporting cast as Bryce Young, but it looked a lot better. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=55.72s)]
*  But I'm writing the quarterback rankings right now. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=59.52s)]
*  I'm doing the blurbs and I saved the young quarterbacks for last because I [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=62.36s)]
*  want to compare how they finished last year to what they're doing in preseason. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=65.04s)]
*  And I watched him and Will Levis back to back. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=68.16s)]
*  And I would not blink if you gave me a choice between those two quarterbacks. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=70.76s)]
*  I would take Will Levis every time. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=73.72s)]
*  I think Will Levis actually showed the traits of a top quarterback. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=75.4s)]
*  With Bryce Young, I didn't see him. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  I'd like, what is the trait? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=81.56s)]
*  What is the thing you've gone on to? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=82.88s)]
*  Like with a lot of these quarterbacks, there's something you could take from [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  their rookie year, like with Josh Allen, he had that bad rookie year, but everyone [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=88.44s)]
*  was like, look at his intermediate numbers from 10 to 19 yards. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  He's one of the best quarterbacks. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  Zach Wilson, it was like over 2.5 seconds. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=95.96s)]
*  If he gets protection, he's one of the higher rated quarterbacks. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=99.0s)]
*  Even like Blaine Gabbard got some of this with Bryce Young. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=101.32s)]
*  There's no split you could do to make his numbers look good. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=103.96s)]
*  In a clean pop. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=107.16s)]
*  It seems like the only case is Dave Canales. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=107.92s)]
*  He's he's he worked magic with Baker Mayfield and now it's going to be Bryce [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=111.36s)]
*  Young. That's the only case I've heard for it other than, Oh, it was a [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=115.24s)]
*  bad year. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=118.28s)]
*  He's learned some stuff and year two. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=118.8s)]
*  And he didn't bring Mike Evans along with him. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=121.4s)]
*  He didn't bring that guy along with him. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=123.24s)]
*  So I don't know how it works out. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=124.52s)]
*  And there has to be a trait you build around. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=127.0s)]
*  Like the comparison before the draft was Steph Curry is the Steph Curry of [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=129.28s)]
*  football. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=132.8s)]
*  What's the equivalent of Steph Curry's three point shooting in Bryce Young's [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=133.68s)]
*  game? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=136.76s)]
*  I think the thing that was shocking to me was that he wasn't as lightning fast [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=138.24s)]
*  scrambling and just, I thought he'd be one of those guys. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=142.84s)]
*  Cause this in college, he was in such control when he moved around and he [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=147.48s)]
*  always felt like he was a half step faster than anyone chasing him. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=151.32s)]
*  And then the pros, he just wasn't. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=153.84s)]
*  So there was that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=155.64s)]
*  And then you get to the pros. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=156.88s)]
*  And I think we just forget this, just how fucking big the linemen are on both [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=158.04s)]
*  sides, you know, and they, he couldn't throw the ball over the middle because, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=162.04s)]
*  you know, that's got six, five here, six, six here, six, seven here. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  So they were trying to like innovate and have them like roll out a little bit or [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  take like a seven step drop. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=173.64s)]
*  And it was pretty ugly. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=175.28s)]
*  I was looking at, I think they're going to be terrible. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=177.0s)]
*  I was looking like, uh, some of their all unders, like they're all under three [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=179.8s)]
*  and a half wins. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=184.4s)]
*  So then we go three and 14 or worse is plus three 30 to go to go four and 13 or [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=185.28s)]
*  worse is plus two of five. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=192.72s)]
*  I think the three worst teams in the league are going to be the Panthers, the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=194.72s)]
*  Patriots, the giants, and I would have Vegas, probably the four, those four. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=198.0s)]
*  I just don't see any path for any of those teams being good. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=204.64s)]
*  Vegas is like the quarterback thing and the coach. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=207.76s)]
*  That's just a mass murder, right? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=210.28s)]
*  Giants, the dimes thing combined with the weird off season they had, that's a murder. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=212.84s)]
*  And then if you're right about Bryce, what's the path for the Panthers? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=219.28s)]
*  They even have first run pick. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=222.04s)]
*  I think even if I'm wrong about Bryce, what's the, what's the path? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=223.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=226.84s)]
*  Like even if Bryce is like the 20th best quarterback in the NFL, the supporting [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=227.68s)]
*  cast is one of the worst in the NFL. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=231.2s)]
*  The defense isn't going to be that good. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=232.84s)]
*  That like, I would put them in their own category almost like with the Raiders. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=235.0s)]
*  I would put the Raiders in there, but at least the Raiders have a defense that [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=239.48s)]
*  looked good last year at the end of last year. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=242.51999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=244.16s)]
*  The Raiders can rush the passer, but that's not going to matter if they're [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=244.4s)]
*  down 14 in the third quarter, like that. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  The big pass rush ain't helping. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=250.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=251.76s)]
*  That's my question. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=251.95999999999998s)]
*  It really, the bigger piece of this would be if he really did suck and got benched [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=252.44s)]
*  this year, now that trade's moving into a whole different category of [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=258.96s)]
*  Caleb's good, right? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=262.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=263.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=264.32s)]
*  And that's, that's the problem. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=264.6s)]
*  We're already seeing some comparisons like Caleb made that one throw where he spun [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=266.04s)]
*  out and threw to his left. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=270.08s)]
*  I saw Panthers Twitter. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=271.32s)]
*  I'm a Panthers fan, so I'm following all those people. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=272.28000000000003s)]
*  They were posting the clips of Bryce Young doing a similar play last year, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=274.40000000000003s)]
*  but it wasn't quite the same. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=277.8s)]
*  But you, you hit the nail on the head. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=279.64s)]
*  Like the pass rushers in this league are big and they're strong and they're fast. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  And Bryce Young is none of those things. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=285.8s)]
*  And you could see him try to work around those defensive linemen is just not there. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=287.68s)]
*  He doesn't have the arm talent to do it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  He can't make the throws to the perimeter. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=293.84s)]
*  And like you said, the middle of the field is kind of cut off to him. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=295.71999999999997s)]
*  There's nowhere else on the field to throw the football. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=298.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=300.2s)]
*  You're just throwing deep outs and stops or screen passers or whatever. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=300.35999999999996s)]
*  Bubble screens. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=305.23999999999995s)]
*  We should have mentioned earlier, you're a giant Panthers fan, so that this is [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=306.84s)]
*  something you've probably put more thought into than any other team and any other [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=310.64s)]
*  take, and you watch Bryce every week. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  And I thought the same thing. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=317.2s)]
*  That was why that one time when he beat the Packers, it was, made me so mad. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=319.44s)]
*  I had the Packers and a tease. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=323.24s)]
*  I'm like, you gotta be fucking kidding me. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=324.48s)]
*  This guy can't do anything every week. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=326.12s)]
*  And now he's torching you. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=328.2s)]
*  But that was the perfect game for him though. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=330.08s)]
*  Cause you face a soft defensive line who does, he's not going to put pressure on [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=331.72s)]
*  the pocket and he's going to play off in the secondary. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=335.12s)]
*  Like that's, that's how he has to play. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=337.64s)]
*  That's the type of defense he has to play. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=339.92s)]
*  You're not going to see those in NFL very often though. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=341.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=344.88s)]
*  And the, the, what is their, let me see what their first four weeks are. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=345.16s)]
*  This is an interesting take with the, and then we'll go. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=349.48s)]
*  The, uh, okay. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=352.16s)]
*  So they start at New Orleans home chargers at Vegas home since he at Chicago. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=354.52000000000004s)]
*  That Chicago game could be a nightmare. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=360.84000000000003s)]
*  If that's week five, if Caleb's awesome and Bryce has like three picks. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=363.12s)]
*  He's somehow, they somehow pulled out the Texans game last year. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=367.72s)]
*  Cause that had the potential to be the disaster because of how shroud look. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=371.84000000000003s)]
*  But if it happens this time, like, especially since they made the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=374.96000000000004s)]
*  like for like trade, like, yeah. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=378.56s)]
*  And with Dave Tepper, it's, it's hard to describe what it's like to be a fan of a [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=380.72s)]
*  team with a bad owner, especially in the NFL, cause it's so easy to [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=386.76s)]
*  hide in plain sight in the NFL. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=389.48s)]
*  You have to be Dan Snyder to get the bad owner rep. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=390.84000000000003s)]
*  We're like in the NBA, if you don't, you know, pay the luxury tax, you're a bad [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  owner and then they'll be, it's very easy. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=397.36s)]
*  Cause there's no salary cap. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=398.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, he's a bad owner. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=401.0s)]
*  He's he's showed it like the hires have been bad, the, the patients, there has [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=402.8s)]
*  been no patients as evidenced by the trade for Bryce Young. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=407.04s)]
*  He couldn't wait one year for Caleb. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=410.24s)]
*  He needed his number one overall pick that year. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=411.76000000000005s)]
*  And he picked a year where the number one prospect was five eight and weighs 180 pounds. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=414.24s)]
*  Well, anytime you fire a coach, you hired during the first season of that coach. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=418.52000000000004s)]
*  It's a pretty rare level to get to as an owner, like to miss that, that [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=423.72s)]
*  badly where you're like, I can't even wait till the end of the year to get rid [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=427.64000000000004s)]
*  of this guy with that, he went the whole off season to hire him. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=430.44s)]
*  And that's how bad it went. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=433.28000000000003s)]
*  He did it with the MLS team too. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=434.84000000000003s)]
*  The MLS, he owns both teams in Charlotte and he fired the MLS manager too within a year. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=436.59999999999997s)]
*  So David Tepper, some people should know in a sports team. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWZP0gLAZ4&t=442.32s)]
