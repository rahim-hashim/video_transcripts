# Jets Optimism Post Saleh? With Sean Fennessey and Peter Schrager | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [October 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4)
*  The Jets. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=0.0s)]
*  They have gone through yet another coach. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1.84s)]
*  So what year were you born? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  1982. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=6.36s)]
*  1982. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=7.72s)]
*  All right. That was the last year of Walt Michaels. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Walt Michaels, Joe Walt and Bruce Coslet. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=12.52s)]
*  We go all the we're going to go through all the Jets coaches. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=14.56s)]
*  But Robert Sala gets fired after five games, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=16.68s)]
*  which was something that probably should have happened in January or February, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=20.68s)]
*  would have been my guess. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=23.92s)]
*  I know you were a little more of a pro-Sala side, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=25.04s)]
*  but if you're going to do this, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=27.36s)]
*  do this with Mike Vrabel and Bill Belichick and Pete Carroll [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=28.8s)]
*  and all these other guys are available. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=31.48s)]
*  Sean, I think you said this. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=33.44s)]
*  You were the most pessimistic Jets fan I knew other than Larry David, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=34.64s)]
*  who actually quit the Jets, doesn't doesn't root for them anymore. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=38.44s)]
*  Why why now? Why not eight months ago? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=42.8s)]
*  What's your take? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=45.16s)]
*  Well, let me just say, as always, I follow in Larry David's footsteps. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=46.08s)]
*  So wherever he goes, I go. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=50.24s)]
*  I've been tracing his career for four decades and I'm proud to follow along with him. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=51.6s)]
*  I just was not sold on the infrastructure of the team. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=55.559999999999995s)]
*  My bigger concern was more that they had not replenish their defensive line [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  and that Nathaniel Hackett was calling offensive plays for the team. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=63.36s)]
*  Both of those things have been problematic at times. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=67.44s)]
*  I think Robert Sala got scapegoated here in a big way, to be honest with you. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=70.64s)]
*  I don't think he was a boat defense. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=73.56s)]
*  I don't think he was the greatest coach in team history, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=75.52s)]
*  but he won seven games in two consecutive seasons with Zach Wilson [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=77.64s)]
*  as his primary quarterback. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=81.0s)]
*  And Zach Wilson stinks. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=82.24s)]
*  So, you know, are we sure Robert Sala was the problem with this team? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=84.24s)]
*  Are we sure? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  Well, he was by the metrics, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  the most successful Jets coach of the last 10 years. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=92.88s)]
*  What was it? 20 and 46? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=96.56s)]
*  20 and 36. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=98.32s)]
*  20 and 36. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=100.08s)]
*  Schrigs has a lot of info. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=101.24s)]
*  You've done some. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=102.64s)]
*  Empty the bag, is that what they say? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=103.52s)]
*  You don't have to give us like 12 minutes, but you can give us like a good three. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=104.72s)]
*  OK, so it's always been an interesting dynamic between Robert Sala [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=108.36s)]
*  and Ambassador Woody Johnson. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=112.84s)]
*  That was in the press release. Ambassador Woody Johnson. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=115.24s)]
*  Forgot. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  It's always been an interesting dynamic because Christopher, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=118.6s)]
*  who is the younger brother by about 15 years, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=120.92s)]
*  he's the one who hired Robert Sala, and he did so when Ambassador Johnson [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  was over in London serving under President Trump. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  So he comes back. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=132.6s)]
*  But Sala was a hot hire. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=133.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah. No, look, Sala had. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=135.4s)]
*  Sean was like semi excited. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=137.44s)]
*  Well, sure. I saw him running up and down the sideline in San Francisco. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  Very cool. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=142.68s)]
*  Detroit native. And they went with Dan Campbell instead. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=144.2s)]
*  He interviewed with Philly and they ended up hiring Nick Sirianni instead. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=146.8s)]
*  It was that year where it was like, OK, is it Mike McDaniel? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=151.24s)]
*  And they ended up hiring Robert Sala. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=153.72s)]
*  Jeff fans were fine with it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=155.16s)]
*  Woody comes back and it's this pressure of like, OK, we've got to perform. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  Now, Rogers, they all go out to Malibu last year, the whole crew. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=160.88s)]
*  They all pitch Rogers. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=164.84s)]
*  They get Rogers in the house and then Rogers goes down. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=166.68s)]
*  So it's almost like a mulligan. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=169.16s)]
*  This year, there was so much optimism after the Thursday night win against the other [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=171.72s)]
*  the building among the sidelines for the game. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=176.52s)]
*  Rogers is in a great mood. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=179.0s)]
*  Sala's in a great mood. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=180.36s)]
*  And no less than two weeks later, one of them's out of a job completely. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=181.72000000000003s)]
*  And I will tell you, there was so much frustration after the Denver loss. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=186.0s)]
*  And then to lose the way they did in London. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=190.20000000000002s)]
*  And Rogers is like taking blame. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=193.28s)]
*  And I understand that he threw three interceptions, but to fall in that hole [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=195.08s)]
*  early and to not be able to bring it in that first half and to again, fall behind [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=197.56s)]
*  early, that was a great frustration of ownership. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=202.96s)]
*  So here's the timeline. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=205.12s)]
*  Monday, they all get in there and like, there's a tension after this flight [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=206.52s)]
*  that like something's going to go down. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=211.48000000000002s)]
*  Like they all know something. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=212.88s)]
*  Oh, so it's like a grim. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  What is that? Six hour flight? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=215.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's about an eight hour flight. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=216.72s)]
*  But like an hour and a half to get to the airport. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  And you've got to get your bags. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  It's not easy. Yeah. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=221.96s)]
*  And then everybody's pissed. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=223.12s)]
*  Monday morning, you walk in. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=224.36s)]
*  And from what I gather, it was like you could hear a pin drop, like, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=225.56s)]
*  what's going to go down, what's going to go down? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=227.84s)]
*  They ended up like, all right, let's. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=229.16s)]
*  So people think it's going to be Hackett. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=230.60000000000002s)]
*  Yes. Something. Hackett will be the scapegoat. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=232.16000000000003s)]
*  Something major is happening. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=234.44s)]
*  Rizal's career is over. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=235.36s)]
*  Everyone's looking over their shoulders. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=236.36s)]
*  22 targets for 80 yards. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=237.84s)]
*  Everyone's looking over their shoulders and they start game planning. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=240.16000000000003s)]
*  And it's like, OK, is nothing going to happen? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=243.04000000000002s)]
*  So then Salah decides and I don't know if this is breaking news and we could put it on your [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=245.96s)]
*  But like there was a conversation with Hackett that moving forward, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=249.51999999999998s)]
*  Todd Downing is going to be calling the place. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  So he tells Hackett that on Monday. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=256.84s)]
*  Hackett was made aware that this was going to go down and that this is the conversation. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=259.15999999999997s)]
*  Plot thickens. And Hackett says to him, dude. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=263.08s)]
*  All good, like all good. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=266.64s)]
*  I'm hurt. I'm heart. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=268.71999999999997s)]
*  Like, it sucks. This went down this way. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=269.8s)]
*  But like whatever it takes for the team to get out of this rut, like we're in this together. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=271.2s)]
*  He's not losing his job. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=275.0s)]
*  He's like, I'm all right. Like, let's do this. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=276.28s)]
*  There were conversations Wednesday. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=279.24s)]
*  They leave the building Wednesday night or Monday. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=280.92s)]
*  I'm sorry. Monday night. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  Now, Roger said on McEvee, he spoke to to Johnson, but it was more about like his ankle and all that stuff. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=284.76s)]
*  I'm sure they talked about the team. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=290.2s)]
*  But I will tell you, there was no code red. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=291.28s)]
*  And as juicy as that is that like Rogers, like on the phone with the owner. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=293.84s)]
*  So he talked to the owner on Monday night after it was decided that his handpicked guy, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=297.4s)]
*  Nathaniel Hackett, would no longer be calling the place. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=302.32s)]
*  Yes. At least for this week. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=304.88s)]
*  OK. Nothing to see there. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=306.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you for expressing some concern about that fact, Bill. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=308.0s)]
*  I appreciate it. We are dubious in Jets Nation, Peter, I will say. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=311.32s)]
*  Yeah. OK. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=314.76s)]
*  So, OK. Tuesday morning, Salah comes in. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=315.71999999999997s)]
*  He's told, you know, just come and sit down. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=319.12s)]
*  And Joe Douglas isn't the one calling him in. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=321.0s)]
*  It's both Johnson brothers and maybe a couple of the people on the highest of levels. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=323.15999999999997s)]
*  And it literally took 10 minutes, maybe even less. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=327.84s)]
*  And it was thanks for your service here. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=330.64s)]
*  We need to spark. We don't like the way the team's playing. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=332.47999999999996s)]
*  You're done. And there'll be no contract extension, which was [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=335.4s)]
*  the hope that if they'd won, he would get a contract extension going into this year. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=337.96s)]
*  And you are no longer the head coach. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=341.35999999999996s)]
*  And Jeff Ulbrich, who ironically also is a defensive coach, is going to take over. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=342.68s)]
*  And the reason that was given to Salah and the reason that's been said publicly, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=347.12s)]
*  they just needed a spark. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  And that Ulbrich is one of these rally around the guys, galvanize the whole thing. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=352.96s)]
*  So Ulbrich talks to Hackett on Tuesday is like, look, this all just fell in my lap. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=357.67999999999995s)]
*  Like, I didn't expect this to happen either. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=362.0s)]
*  No one was manipulating this behind the scenes. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=363.32s)]
*  I think we're going to go with Todd, as was the plan to call plays [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  Hackett again, and it sounds like he's some noble guy. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=370.84s)]
*  And I know the memes are hilarious of him as like the office space dude or whatever it is. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=373.59999999999997s)]
*  Like, what does he do as the offensive coordinator who's not calling plays? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=377.84s)]
*  But Hackett is just like, whatever you guys need, I'm here. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=381.08s)]
*  I just let's let's. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=383.03999999999996s)]
*  He's not like an offensive designer. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=384.64s)]
*  Like he designs the plays, he just doesn't call them. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=388.08s)]
*  He's like, hey, I've designed a run sweep. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=391.28s)]
*  Suggestions welcome. Right. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=394.48s)]
*  So, hey, I was thinking about I was thinking about wide receiver passes. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=395.92s)]
*  I laid out a couple options. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=400.6s)]
*  That's it. So Hackett, who's been the ire of Jets fans for multiple years, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=402.6s)]
*  takes a backseat. Todd Downing is inserted. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=407.36s)]
*  Now, Downing was an OC in Tennessee. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=410.32s)]
*  He made a major mistake, lost his job in Tennessee. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=412.44s)]
*  And his major mistake. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=415.72s)]
*  He he had a DUI. Oh, after. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=417.2s)]
*  Oh, that kind of flight. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=420.04s)]
*  They they came back. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=421.44s)]
*  You're going to say he like ran. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=422.40000000000003s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=423.8s)]
*  But he paid, you know, he paid for that. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=425.36s)]
*  And he's been very open and apologetic about that situation. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=427.56s)]
*  And he's now the offensive coordinator. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=430.64s)]
*  And what's going backwards? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=433.04s)]
*  Or do you have more? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=434.8s)]
*  I just really quickly like and I would love Sean's thoughts. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=435.48s)]
*  Like it went from. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=439.24s)]
*  After the Denver game, everyone wanted Hackett fired, they actually. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=441.24s)]
*  I mean, I hack it. Yeah, hack it. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=444.0s)]
*  And Salah Salah actually gets fired and fans like what a circus. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=445.16s)]
*  The Mets suck. The Jets suck. We're such a circus. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=448.16s)]
*  And then now, like 48 hours later, they talk to Jets fans are like, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=450.52s)]
*  all right, we made the changes. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=454.28000000000003s)]
*  I like this old brick. He's kind of cool. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=455.40000000000003s)]
*  OK, new play color. All right. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=456.92s)]
*  And Roger's ankle is actually better than we thought. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=458.12s)]
*  All right. And if we win on Monday, we're three and three like they're optimistic again. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=460.2s)]
*  Like it's totally half. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=463.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's half full. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=465.68s)]
*  And it's like there were there were necessary changes made, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=466.96000000000004s)]
*  whether or not we love Salah or we don't. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=470.96000000000004s)]
*  But like the Rogers piece, I'm told he was as shocked as anyone. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=473.48s)]
*  I know that's going to be with rolled eyes and maybe I'm carrying water. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=478.0s)]
*  If you think from what I know, from my reporting, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=480.92s)]
*  everyone was knocked on their ass by this. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=483.20000000000005s)]
*  And a lot of the players were actually very upset that Salah was let go. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=485.04s)]
*  You want the floor shot? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=488.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, I'll just say, I think honestly, this just seemed like it happened [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=490.20000000000005s)]
*  one week earlier than expected. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=492.92s)]
*  Most people who follow the team closely felt like if they lost against Buffalo [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=494.72s)]
*  with this opportunity to move into first place, despite these two sad [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=498.8s)]
*  yeah, experiences in another national game for the team. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=501.96000000000004s)]
*  If Salah is on the sideline once again, crossing his arms, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=505.0s)]
*  staring into the black abyss of nothingness and got fired, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=508.52000000000004s)]
*  no one would be surprised. It just felt one week early. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=512.72s)]
*  He's not been successful as a head coach. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=515.44s)]
*  He seems like a wonderful guy. And you hear that all around. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=517.0s)]
*  You say the same is true for your boy, Nat Hackett. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=518.88s)]
*  He seems like a nice guy. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=520.88s)]
*  I got nothing against him personally, but both he and his father [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=522.12s)]
*  have been terrible play callers for the New York Jets in my lifetime. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=525.28s)]
*  And it's been very painful to deal with that. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=528.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm glad Hackett is not calling plays. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=531.0400000000001s)]
*  I feel bad for Salah, but he had a long stretch of time here to turn it around. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=533.52s)]
*  And he was not able to do it. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=537.4s)]
*  I think what you said is right, Peter, which is that honestly, if they win [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=539.0s)]
*  and Ulbrich fires them up and we've seen the new coach bump, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=541.8s)]
*  Antonio Pierce is coaching on a new contract because of the new coach bump, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=544.52s)]
*  then that would be fantastic. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=548.16s)]
*  They have a good enough roster to be a playoff team. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=549.52s)]
*  Everybody knows it. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=552.0s)]
*  And that's going to crush Salah. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=553.0799999999999s)]
*  Like, I know the guy like he is fully convinced that this team is a playoff team [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=554.28s)]
*  and can still do it. Who cares about Salah? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=558.28s)]
*  I understand like we move on in this world, but like it's [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=559.68s)]
*  I think they're going to win Monday night against the Bills. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=562.52s)]
*  They're going to be three and three. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=564.68s)]
*  They play the fourth easiest schedule from here on out. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=565.92s)]
*  Ten of their games are on the Eastern seaboard. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=568.9599999999999s)]
*  Moving forward in their first four games, the schedule was insane. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=571.64s)]
*  It was started off Monday night, then had a short week playing in Tennessee. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=575.36s)]
*  Three and eleven. Eleven days, right? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=579.04s)]
*  Yeah. Three. And then that Denver game in London. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=581.04s)]
*  Horrible weather game. And then they went to London. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=583.24s)]
*  And, you know, the offense. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=585.36s)]
*  Roger's big question for me is like Breeze Hall and Wilson were considered [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=587.44s)]
*  two of the biggest fantasy assets heading into the season, especially Breeze Hall, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=591.48s)]
*  who was just a complete zero like that alone. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=596.4s)]
*  It's like somebody's got to pay. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=598.84s)]
*  The backup was playing more than Breeze Hall was. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=601.08s)]
*  I say this as somebody who has Breeze Hall. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=603.6800000000001s)]
*  I think on two of my three teams. Yeah, it's painful. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=605.52s)]
*  It hurt my feelings. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=608.48s)]
*  Well, it's a lot of people thought that Braylon Allen [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=609.72s)]
*  should have gotten more touches two weeks ago. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=611.96s)]
*  And then he got more touches last week. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=614.2800000000001s)]
*  And I wouldn't say it was significantly better than Breeze. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=615.6800000000001s)]
*  The issue is an offensive line issue. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=617.64s)]
*  They have an I don't know what it is, but the scheming in the run game [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=619.44s)]
*  is weak right now. Predictable. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=622.76s)]
*  I thought Dan Arlovsky did a really nice job identifying some of the issues [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=625.2800000000001s)]
*  on fourth down on Twitter this week. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=628.24s)]
*  The play calling's been bad. It's been really bad. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=630.48s)]
*  Will a new play caller just make Breeze look better? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=632.8s)]
*  I don't know. Maybe you will. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=634.92s)]
*  You get Morgan Moses back, who was really good those first few weeks, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=636.16s)]
*  and they were worried at the Patriots game. They lost him. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=639.8s)]
*  And then he and Vera Tucker are to the best at what they do. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=641.6800000000001s)]
*  And the thought is maybe we can get the run game kickstarted again behind them. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=644.16s)]
*  But all the Jets fans are accurate in that this has been a great [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=646.92s)]
*  disappointing, a great disappointment through five games. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=651.92s)]
*  I had them as the number one seed in the AFC. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=654.64s)]
*  And Rogers is my MVP. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=656.76s)]
*  Based on being there this summer and doing a preseason game. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=658.6s)]
*  And this goes back to our discussion before week one when we were like, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=662.64s)]
*  is being there good or bad? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=666.76s)]
*  100%. I can't watch the scheme and the rain against Denver [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=668.28s)]
*  when it's August on a beautiful day. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=672.2s)]
*  I can't see them trying to stop Bo Nix. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=673.52s)]
*  So Salah went 20 and 36. He was 22 and 34 against the spread, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=675.4s)]
*  which I thought was incredible. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=680.88s)]
*  Sean, I'm a results guy. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=682.16s)]
*  I look at Adam, Adam Driver's last six movies. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=684.84s)]
*  How dare you? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=688.36s)]
*  Last Duel, Brooklyn Guy, Sean, House of Gucci, White Noise. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=690.44s)]
*  Yep. 65, Ferrari, Megalopolis. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=695.52s)]
*  Say that again. Megalopolis. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=701.76s)]
*  God, I like that. I love that word. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=703.9200000000001s)]
*  The trailer was great. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=706.6s)]
*  Sean, I see the Robert Salah of A List Actors. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=707.72s)]
*  What was that? Salah Have a Girls? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=710.24s)]
*  I like four of those six movies, to be perfectly honest with you. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=712.16s)]
*  Which two did you like? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=715.72s)]
*  I think they're bold choices in his career. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=716.72s)]
*  And I admire Adam Driver. Adam Driver is an artist. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=718.08s)]
*  Robert Salah is a coach. He's a manager. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=720.5600000000001s)]
*  And we need results as managers. I'm a manager, Bill. You know that. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=723.36s)]
*  But Adam Driver, you know, he does something a little bit different. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=726.8s)]
*  And I will not compare him. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=729.64s)]
*  But yeah, Ferrari is good. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=731.64s)]
*  Is it on the planes? Yeah, I was thinking that's a perfect plane movie. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=733.08s)]
*  Like it's a perfect plane movie if you want to sleep on a cross country flight. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=736.08s)]
*  Because it's so slow. Please support the cinemas. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=739.6s)]
*  You know, go to the theater. I'm begging you. 100 percent. I will. I will. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=741.8800000000001s)]
*  I want to see the Pharrell Williams Lego movie in the theater with my kid. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=744.8000000000001s)]
*  I will see that. Piece by piece. That's the speech. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=748.1600000000001s)]
*  I will see that. Peter, do you believe in the new coach theory? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=750.48s)]
*  I do. I think in the NFL, there is a definite bump. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=753.7600000000001s)]
*  The question is, can you sustain it over, you know, this length of time? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=756.36s)]
*  What's interesting is no coach has been fired this early in the season [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=760.48s)]
*  since Matt Ruhl was and Steve Wilkes in 2022 filled in. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=763.96s)]
*  And they went five hundred the rest of the way. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=767.8s)]
*  But like, I think if you if you hire a coach with like four weeks left in the season, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=769.4399999999999s)]
*  they can often go three and one and finish the season. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=773.64s)]
*  They still have so much football left to play. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=776.3599999999999s)]
*  And you had all summer of Robert Sala and so on. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=778.9599999999999s)]
*  I think Ken Ulbrich just come in and fire up the guys like I've known Jeff for a while. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=781.88s)]
*  Like he is a fiery coach. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=786.0799999999999s)]
*  He is everything you thought Sala was going to be when he was running up [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=788.1999999999999s)]
*  and down the sidelines at San Francisco. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=790.64s)]
*  That's this guy in the building. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=792.5999999999999s)]
*  Does that translate as the head coach over the course of three months? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=793.9599999999999s)]
*  We'll have to see. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=797.2s)]
*  I had the data and I think I accidentally deleted it from my iPad. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=798.2s)]
*  So that's just an old guy moment for me. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=802.0400000000001s)]
*  But Jeff Saturday, that was the most famous one. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=804.0s)]
*  New coach. I mean, that was his only good one. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=809.4000000000001s)]
*  But last year we had Brandon Staley got fired. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=812.2s)]
*  New guy came in for the Chargers and they I think were plus 12. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=815.2s)]
*  OK, against maybe it was the Bills and they end up losing. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=819.84s)]
*  They were down about 56, nothing against the Raiders. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=822.9200000000001s)]
*  Carolina, they covered the first the first week. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=825.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So anyway, in my research, it was the last four have all covered. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=828.3199999999999s)]
*  Covered or one Antonio Pierce was another one. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=834.12s)]
*  Yeah. The last one that didn't was when Matt Ruhl got fired after week five. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=836.56s)]
*  So it's Wilkes the week six game. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=841.28s)]
*  Ransby lost. But then they got better with 500 as the year went along. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=842.8s)]
*  So there's some first there's some new coach blood. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=847.36s)]
*  I've always believed this, but I could see the Jets are getting two and a half [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=851.0s)]
*  against Buffalo. That spoiler is going to be a million dollar pick for me. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=854.72s)]
*  Yes. That just seems like a classic. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=858.76s)]
*  We've responded. Oh, my God. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=861.24s)]
*  Breeze Hall had 20 carries for 138 yards. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=863.4s)]
*  And it's just because we fired the coach. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=866.6800000000001s)]
*  I'll go to this game. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=868.64s)]
*  I'll tell you. Yeah, I'll go to this game. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=869.64s)]
*  And I will tell you that, like, if they hadn't fired solid or demoted Hackett [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=871.6s)]
*  and Sean, you know this, the second there was a three and out, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=876.24s)]
*  it would be boo birds. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=879.84s)]
*  I think the vibe has changed. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=880.96s)]
*  It's like, all right, they made the changes. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=882.4s)]
*  Now let's root for the team. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=884.32s)]
*  I think that's how Jets fans feel going into this weekend. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=885.5200000000001s)]
*  But Sean, you were the most down on the team of anyone I knew. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=887.6400000000001s)]
*  Well, you even have a tweet that you happily reposted. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=891.5200000000001s)]
*  You're a reposter if you're right about something. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=894.84s)]
*  I am. You were you were super skeptical. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=897.0s)]
*  You didn't understand. I had the Jets win in the division. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=899.48s)]
*  He had Roger's MVP and you were completely out. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=902.12s)]
*  So what's changed? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=905.5200000000001s)]
*  Well, the Mets, the Mets have changed. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=907.4000000000001s)]
*  Maybe it's optimism. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=910.24s)]
*  The Mets is spilling over. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=911.48s)]
*  I'm not optimistic about the season. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=913.24s)]
*  I mean, I think they have the talent on the roster to be a playoff team. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=915.28s)]
*  I think they've put themselves now in a very difficult position by being under 500 [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=918.96s)]
*  and losing, in particular, the Broncos game, I think is going to come back [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=923.12s)]
*  to haunt them in a big way. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=926.44s)]
*  That's not a game you want to lose. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=927.52s)]
*  And it's not a game that they should have lost. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=928.72s)]
*  So that feels terrible. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=930.8s)]
*  You mean when they made history by losing a game or the other QB through for [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=932.92s)]
*  less yards in any win than Eli Manning in 2007? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=939.12s)]
*  That was incredible. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=942.64s)]
*  If Zerline makes that field goal. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=943.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=944.9599999999999s)]
*  If Zerline makes the field goal, Salah probably has a job. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=946.1199999999999s)]
*  Here's the the other thing about the firing Salah that is interesting [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=948.68s)]
*  is the Jets defense has given up two touchdowns total in the last three games. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=952.1199999999999s)]
*  Right. They're still doing what they always do. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=956.5999999999999s)]
*  They bend sometimes, but they never broke under Salah. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=959.0s)]
*  And that's why I say I think he was scapegoated here. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=962.4799999999999s)]
*  Now, obviously, Ulbricht is the person calling the plays for the defense. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=965.0s)]
*  But man, they put together a good unit. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=968.0799999999999s)]
*  They developed a lot of good players. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=969.7199999999999s)]
*  Quincy Williams is like a top 10 linebacker in the NFL now. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=971.0s)]
*  He was a cast off at the beginning of their administration. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=973.92s)]
*  He's a really good defensive coach. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=976.36s)]
*  So we will see what happens. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=978.08s)]
*  I'm skeptical because I think there are a couple of choices that they had to make [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=979.96s)]
*  to bring in Hassan Reddick that just totally backfired on them. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=983.48s)]
*  And I feel like they're very weak. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=986.48s)]
*  Johnson made a plea on the conference call. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=988.16s)]
*  He's like, please, Hassan, the owner, come. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=990.04s)]
*  Doors are open. Let's talk. Let's get here. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=992.32s)]
*  Hassan Reddick is like, yeah, pay me more. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=995.16s)]
*  If Reddick signs, it's a different thing to me. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=996.56s)]
*  If Reddick signs, I think they're actually a different team. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=998.8s)]
*  I think they're a much scarier team. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1000.96s)]
*  A lot of Jets fans are looking back in hindsight and saying, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1002.32s)]
*  we drafted a sixth offensive lineman in Olu at a Penn State when Brock Bowers was on the board. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1005.52s)]
*  Where do you stand on that? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1010.72s)]
*  Would you have wanted Bowers or the offensive line? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1011.64s)]
*  Because everyone says, well, the offensive line sucks. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1013.36s)]
*  They got an offensive lineman. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1014.8000000000001s)]
*  But it's kind of a swing tackle in his rookie year. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1015.96s)]
*  Yeah. Well, Tyron Smith looks a little old right now, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1017.9200000000001s)]
*  so I don't feel so bad about that pick. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1021.4000000000001s)]
*  If Olu is going to be the long term left tackle, I feel OK with it. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1023.0s)]
*  He's a rookie. What can you expect? He got thrown into this. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1025.96s)]
*  I don't feel too bad about that. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1028.1200000000001s)]
*  Brock Bowers does look nasty and I've got him on two fantasy teams. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1029.52s)]
*  He's pretty good. Jets defense, first in yards per play, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1032.6s)]
*  second against the pass, seventh and first downs, fifth scoring, sixth red zone. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1036.6s)]
*  Like they've been really good for years. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1042.8s)]
*  And that's kind of Sal's calling card was the defense was always good [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1044.76s)]
*  and always overachieving, but nothing else seemed to work. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1048.84s)]
*  But he's not the defensive coordinator. He's the head coach. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1051.28s)]
*  Someone needs someone needs to take the fall. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1053.24s)]
*  Unfortunately, he's the one whose blood is shed. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1055.0s)]
*  But here's the thing. If that that stupid running into the kicker thing [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1057.56s)]
*  didn't get called in a 17 nothing, Rogers is looking toward the blue 10. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1061.52s)]
*  It looks like Rogers is like, I think I'm out. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1065.0s)]
*  I'll see you guys back in America. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1067.12s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, they had a first down. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1069.0s)]
*  It's like, I'm back in. And he's he's running back in. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1070.52s)]
*  I'll say this about Rogers. I'm happy to go on the record. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1072.96s)]
*  There's no way they didn't tell him what was happening with the coach. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1076.24s)]
*  I just don't believe it. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1078.4399999999998s)]
*  There's a lot of few good men. I'm so tired. Parallels here. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1079.4399999999998s)]
*  Kyle, turn the camera on that's directly pointing at me. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1082.8799999999999s)]
*  When the star of the team always knows what's going on. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1086.68s)]
*  Period. End of story. I don't care if it's bad. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1090.0s)]
*  Like, Janis, oh, my God, I had no idea the Drew Holiday trade was happening. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1092.24s)]
*  I just don't believe it ever because you have to be a fucking idiot. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1096.72s)]
*  If you own a sports team and you're paying somebody 50, 55 million, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1100.04s)]
*  or in Rogers case, you built this whole team around him [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1104.76s)]
*  and you're just not going to tell him you fired somebody, that's insane. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1107.4s)]
*  I disagree. Nobody would do that. I disagree. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1110.04s)]
*  I think they honestly had a conversation. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1112.1200000000001s)]
*  They slept on it overnight and the owner is like, I'm not going to put this on Rogers. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1114.1599999999999s)]
*  That's his, you know, he and he and Sal have a good relationship. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1117.7199999999998s)]
*  All that stuff. There's so many interpersonal relationships. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1120.56s)]
*  I think Woody Johnson is a 77 year old owner who's like, I don't want to watch this anymore. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1122.8s)]
*  I need a spark. I'm making a move. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1127.56s)]
*  Counter. What's the upside? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1129.6s)]
*  What else are you going to say? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1132.9599999999998s)]
*  You like, yeah, we talked to Aaron. He knew. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1135.32s)]
*  Like, you can't. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1138.6399999999999s)]
*  You're just going to fall on the sword every time for the star. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1139.8799999999999s)]
*  That's what the NBA teams. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1142.12s)]
*  This has been like you think about people like LeBron. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1143.8799999999999s)]
*  Like you think for the last 15 years of his career, they weren't running every move by LeBron. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1147.32s)]
*  It's like, yeah, we got to trade Russell Westbrook. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1152.6799999999998s)]
*  Let's not tell LeBron. Like they're fucking telling him. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1154.56s)]
*  I mean, the irony of all of this and Bill, I tend to lean more in your direction on this one [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1157.6799999999998s)]
*  is that Aaron Rogers wasn't good on Sunday. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1163.6799999999998s)]
*  I don't know if he was exactly the reason that they lost, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1166.4799999999998s)]
*  but he had never thrown two picks in the first quarter of a game in his entire career. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1169.16s)]
*  One of the reasons why they fell behind so badly is because they were turning the ball over. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1173.16s)]
*  In that in the fourth quarter, if he hits that throw to Garrett Wilson along the sideline, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1177.24s)]
*  they're walking off and winning that game. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1181.64s)]
*  So Mike Williams won the next time we're through the pick. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1183.4s)]
*  Yeah, he's not moving the same either. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1185.56s)]
*  He heard his ankle significantly. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1188.44s)]
*  Like he was banged up and I think the Jets fans are surprised he's, you know, actually, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1190.2s)]
*  you know, as good as he is right now. But I hear you guys. I'm not dumb. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1194.52s)]
*  Like I know how any company works and they all flew out to Malibu and sat in his house [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1197.1599999999999s)]
*  and begged him to come there and explain. I get it. I'm not dumb. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1201.24s)]
*  At some point, you're you reach the consultancy stage of stardom with a team. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1204.76s)]
*  And I think he's there would be my guess. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1211.0s)]
*  But like my homes is like if the Chiefs did anything in there and my home's like, yeah, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1214.04s)]
*  no idea. Like, I'm sorry. I'm just never believing that there's no way they're not running stuff. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1219.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we traded Travis Kelsey. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1223.8s)]
*  You're putting me in a tough spot because I sound idiotic saying that he did. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1225.8s)]
*  I think there is a reality where they talked about, you know, just the game, whatever. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1229.48s)]
*  And then Woody says on his own, you know what? Like Rogers doesn't seem thrilled. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1234.12s)]
*  We're not thrilled watching this. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1236.68s)]
*  Make a change. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1238.36s)]
*  He at least asked him like whether he told him he was doing that. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1238.68s)]
*  He that's a tough spot to put on Rogers. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1241.8799999999999s)]
*  I think like Woody, how's the coaching? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1244.12s)]
*  I think that's really I don't think the owners, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1245.96s)]
*  I don't think they would put that on him in that responsibility. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1247.8s)]
*  I don't think they want you're putting anything past Woody Johnson as a maniac. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1249.96s)]
*  You think he's rational? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1255.8799999999999s)]
*  Sort of in Peter's defense for what he's saying. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1258.44s)]
*  I think what is happening right now is obviously Johnson, when he was the ambassador to the UK, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1260.36s)]
*  was away from the team for a few years and things really went downhill when he was away from the [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1263.72s)]
*  team. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1267.6399999999999s)]
*  I suppose when he was really involved, it was going so great. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1268.12s)]
*  It wasn't. It wasn't. But there was a time when he was the owner in the Rex period where things [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1271.6399999999999s)]
*  looked good and it seemed like that was going to be a good ownership group. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1276.2s)]
*  And they are now mired in the longest playoff drought in North American sports history. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1279.48s)]
*  13 years they have not been to the playoffs. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1283.32s)]
*  So I think there's a case to be made that Woody is like, I got legacy stuff on the line here. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1286.04s)]
*  Aside from my family business, this is something I will be remembered for if I turn out to be [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1293.48s)]
*  a world-class bad sports owner in New York. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1297.88s)]
*  That's not something you want to be. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1301.24s)]
*  So he's James Dahl, it's like cold my beer. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1302.52s)]
*  But look, that's another team that were a guy backed away. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1305.24s)]
*  And all of a sudden, they're a very interesting proposition in the city. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1308.2s)]
*  And also honestly, the Mets and the Yankees and the Knicks all being exciting and the [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1311.48s)]
*  Jets being a tire fire is terrible. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1317.0s)]
*  And that's something you feel when you live in New York. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1319.0s)]
*  So I wonder if some of that is contributing to him. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1321.32s)]
*  He's never fired a coach this early into the season like this. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1324.28s)]
*  This is something he's never done before. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1327.48s)]
*  So it's a rare thing in general. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1329.08s)]
*  It is. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1331.32s)]
*  It's like once a year maybe. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1331.96s)]
*  And I honestly think the fact that he did not hire Robert Sala, it's like this is not [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1333.72s)]
*  my handpicked guy. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1339.16s)]
*  This team is built to win right now with this quarterback right now. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1340.44s)]
*  If this can salvage the season, this is my sign to the fans that I'm actually doubling [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1344.6000000000001s)]
*  down on this team and saying, I know we're not winning a Super Bowl as it is right now. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1348.52s)]
*  I know we're not winning Super Bowl with Sala as our head coach. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1353.96s)]
*  I'm going to do this. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1357.0s)]
*  I'm going to do this. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1358.6000000000001s)]
*  And I will create this atmosphere that, okay, same old Jets, we're idiots. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1359.8s)]
*  But if that's what it takes to salvage this thing, I don't just want to watch the season [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1364.28s)]
*  go down the tubes with a guy that I didn't pick that I don't think is going to win us [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1367.24s)]
*  a Super Bowl. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1369.88s)]
*  So explain to me pro football why they couldn't just get Mike Vrabel 10 hours after they fire [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1370.68s)]
*  Sala. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1376.1200000000001s)]
*  You can. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1376.44s)]
*  Vrabel's under contract. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1377.24s)]
*  People are like, oh, it's so hard for a coach to come in during this. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1378.5200000000002s)]
*  I'm like, is it that hard? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1383.0s)]
*  I actually had conversations about this because I didn't think Vrabel. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1384.44s)]
*  I thought Belichick. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1387.48s)]
*  Is it possible? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1388.68s)]
*  He hates the Jets. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1389.3200000000002s)]
*  I don't think he'll ever do it. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1390.68s)]
*  I was just thinking hypothetically. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1391.24s)]
*  And the only situation that that's been done off the couch, not a coach, not with the team, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1393.0800000000002s)]
*  midseason was Saturday. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1399.4s)]
*  And that was because that's Ursay's guy. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1400.68s)]
*  And he did it. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1402.6000000000001s)]
*  But Saturday was on ESPN. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1403.0800000000002s)]
*  He's like, midway through the season, having never coached before in the NFL, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1404.0400000000002s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1407.8000000000002s)]
*  And then I bet against any one. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1408.52s)]
*  It's still crazy. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1409.5600000000002s)]
*  They beat the Raiders. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1410.44s)]
*  They beat the Raiders. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1411.24s)]
*  It was a terrible loss. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1412.1200000000001s)]
*  It's still crazy that they did that. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1413.16s)]
*  Then I was thinking, well, I'm watching Belichick. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1415.5600000000002s)]
*  He's following the game as close as anybody. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1417.16s)]
*  And the Jets, he despises the Jets and doesn't like the Johnson family. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1419.0s)]
*  And so he wouldn't go there. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1422.76s)]
*  But hypothetically, if another coach was fired midseason, could a Belichick come over? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1423.8000000000002s)]
*  Like a Pete Carroll. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1429.0s)]
*  Just come in and have a great, have a lot of energy. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1429.96s)]
*  Another coach with a lot of Jets history. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1432.6s)]
*  Yeah, Pete Carroll, sure. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1434.52s)]
*  Fired after a year. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1435.6399999999999s)]
*  They could, technically, they could. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1436.76s)]
*  It's just, you don't know those coaches. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1439.8799999999999s)]
*  You don't know that offense. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1442.44s)]
*  You don't know that even. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1443.56s)]
*  It would be more than anything, just a rah rah guy, usually. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1444.2s)]
*  And just, hey, I'm here to change the spots. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1447.0s)]
*  I would have gotten Vrebel five minutes later. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1448.44s)]
*  I think that guy's like a top center coach. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1450.84s)]
*  And he would have to, I mean, obviously Tennessee. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1452.2s)]
*  Tennessee's paying him a ton already. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1454.52s)]
*  Cleveland has him on staff. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1456.76s)]
*  I'm sure Cleveland would let him leave to go be a head coach. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1458.4399999999998s)]
*  I guess the tough thing would be taking over another coaching staff. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1460.52s)]
*  Because I know Doc, Doc even talked about that publicly. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1463.2399999999998s)]
*  You're inheriting all these people. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1465.8s)]
*  And it turns into Game of Thrones with all the assistants. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1467.8s)]
*  Quickly, Jets are plus 310 on Fandl to win the division right now. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1470.52s)]
*  The all win total for the Jets on Fandl is over nine and a half is plus 235. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1476.28s)]
*  And then eight and a half is the over. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1486.0400000000002s)]
*  Do you have, okay. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1488.44s)]
*  Do the Jets go nine and eight? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1489.0800000000002s)]
*  I think that they can. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1491.24s)]
*  I don't know if they will. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1492.68s)]
*  I will say historically this division is usually a bloodbath. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1493.8000000000002s)]
*  And the Jets are typically at the bottom. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1497.64s)]
*  So if we're in a year where the Jets are like a nine, 10, even 18. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1499.4s)]
*  You think the Pats are awful and Miami's awful. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1502.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1504.92s)]
*  That's my point. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1505.4s)]
*  You haven't even played the Pats yet. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1506.3600000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1508.0400000000002s)]
*  And the Bills have. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1508.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't know how they don't get to the right game. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1509.24s)]
*  They beat the Pats week three. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1510.44s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1511.48s)]
*  Have they played the Dolphins? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1512.0400000000002s)]
*  They have not played the Dolphins. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1513.48s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1515.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1516.2s)]
*  They have three games left against those two. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1516.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1518.2s)]
*  They're plus one, 10 over eight and a half. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1518.36s)]
*  Which is more of a reason. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1520.04s)]
*  I think that there was an urgency to get this done. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1521.08s)]
*  All right. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1523.16s)]
*  So the Jets have been in my life really since I started watching football with Jim Plunkett, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1523.4s)]
*  1974, a little kid, pretending I was Randy Batajo in the backyard. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1529.64s)]
*  And then the Pats were good in 76, 77, 78. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1533.96s)]
*  And the Jets were kind of parallel. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1538.12s)]
*  They actually had a couple of good moments too. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1541.0s)]
*  And then we kind of both settled into just being the black sheep of the AFC simultaneously. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1542.76s)]
*  But I can start to really remember football around the mid 70s. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1548.52s)]
*  Lou Holtz was the Jets coach in 76. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1551.64s)]
*  Coached 13 games and then got fired or quit. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1554.36s)]
*  Three and 10. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1557.48s)]
*  But then they brought in Walt Michaels. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1558.6s)]
*  And Walt Michaels presided over I think the 82 Jets, which made the, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1561.16s)]
*  they lost to Miami 14-0. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1565.96s)]
*  So I started researching this. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1568.84s)]
*  Walt Michaels, that was his last game. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1570.9199999999998s)]
*  They lost the AFC title game 14-0. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1572.9199999999998s)]
*  And this is in the research. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1576.1999999999998s)]
*  The day after that game, Michaels did not show up for the Jets final team meeting. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1577.4799999999998s)]
*  17 days later, retired saying a break, saying he needed a break. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1582.28s)]
*  The New York Times reported that during Michael's last meeting with Leon Hess, the Jets owner, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1586.52s)]
*  he was told to resign, given a $400,000 financial package and encouraged to seek treatment for [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1591.0s)]
*  alcohol abuse. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1596.52s)]
*  He accepted the terms. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1597.4799999999998s)]
*  And then coached in the USFL three years later and that was it. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1599.0s)]
*  He was replaced by the one and only Joe Walton. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1602.12s)]
*  Joe Walton, I was going to say. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1605.4s)]
*  So my high school buddy, Jim Grady, diehard Jets fan. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1606.2s)]
*  And we got to know each other in the mid 80s. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1610.44s)]
*  And Joe Walton was our favorite because the camera would always catch him picking his nose [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1613.0s)]
*  on the sidelines. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1617.24s)]
*  The insight you come for. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1619.24s)]
*  He would just be like, kind of like one knuckle deep every time they showed him. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1620.44s)]
*  But we thought it was the funniest thing. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1623.96s)]
*  There was some good Jets years. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1625.4s)]
*  I mean, there was that Richard Todd year, the sack exchange. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1627.4s)]
*  And then Kenny O'Brien had some years where they would actually win games. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1630.2s)]
*  They did. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1633.0s)]
*  They were favored in the Pats playoff game when the Pats won the Super Bowl. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1633.8000000000002s)]
*  Anyway, he lasted through the 80s. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1637.0s)]
*  I looked up his New York Times obit and the headline of it was Joe Walton, giant star [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1639.3200000000002s)]
*  who found futility as Jets coach, dies at 85. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1645.88s)]
*  That was the headline. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1649.48s)]
*  That's some dig. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1650.52s)]
*  The headline of an obituary. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1651.48s)]
*  Give him a little bit of flowers here. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1652.76s)]
*  So then next was the immortal Bruce Coslet. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1654.76s)]
*  Is that the first coach you remember or no? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1657.96s)]
*  It is. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1659.96s)]
*  I was telling you earlier, Bill, that one of my first sports memories, probably my first [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1660.76s)]
*  football memory, because I was a baseball fan and I remember the Mets being good in [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1664.76s)]
*  88. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1667.96s)]
*  But in 90 when Coslet came in, my father despised Bruce Coslet. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1668.76s)]
*  He coached. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1672.76s)]
*  Bowl haircut and really bolder glasses. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1674.76s)]
*  Starter jacket. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1676.76s)]
*  I remember that. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1677.8s)]
*  He looked like an SNL character. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1678.84s)]
*  That orangey hair color. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1680.84s)]
*  He was a very stoic figure, but he coached eight NFL seasons in full and never had a [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1682.84s)]
*  winning season. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1688.84s)]
*  So he was kind of Robert Sala before Robert Sala. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1690.04s)]
*  He was wildly unsuccessful. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1692.04s)]
*  Was it Bengals first and then Jets? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1694.04s)]
*  It was Jets then Bengals. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1696.04s)]
*  Jets then Bengals. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1698.04s)]
*  Four years, no winning seasons for the Jets, replaced by Pete Carroll. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1700.04s)]
*  One year. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1702.04s)]
*  One year and done. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1704.04s)]
*  And then I forgot because I was researching this. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1706.52s)]
*  It was the fake spike. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1708.52s)]
*  It was 94. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1710.52s)]
*  It was the famous year. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1712.52s)]
*  They're like six and five. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1714.52s)]
*  I watched that game when it happened. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1716.52s)]
*  Marino does the fake spike. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1718.52s)]
*  I was there. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1720.52s)]
*  I was there with my friend Matt and I and my friend Josh Levin. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1722.52s)]
*  We all went and they were like six and four maybe at the time. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1724.52s)]
*  Six and five. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1726.52s)]
*  Then they lost every game the rest of the season. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1728.52s)]
*  And it was like, I guess he had to go. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1730.52s)]
*  And that was Mark Ingram's dad. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1732.52s)]
*  So they bring in Rich Cotite. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1735.0s)]
*  From the Eagles. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1737.0s)]
*  Who was four and 28 in two years. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1739.0s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1741.0s)]
*  And then there's a whole, I didn't get fired, I quit. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1743.0s)]
*  And he was like, well we were about to fire you and you quit. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1745.0s)]
*  That was when they got Neil O'Donnell. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1747.0s)]
*  This is my favorite version of the Jets. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1749.0s)]
*  They signed Neil O'Donnell from the Steelers. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1751.0s)]
*  And he had the press conference. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1753.0s)]
*  And I was living with my buddy Jeff Gow at the time. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1755.0s)]
*  And Neil came in. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1757.0s)]
*  Vikings fan. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1759.0s)]
*  I'm a listener. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1761.0s)]
*  And then he's like, I was brought here to win games. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1763.48s)]
*  He talked like Francesa. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1765.48s)]
*  I'm a winner. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1767.48s)]
*  The Jets are winners. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1769.48s)]
*  And we were like, this is amazing. The Jets definitely aren't winners. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1771.48s)]
*  And he was terrible. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1773.48s)]
*  Replaced by Bill Parcells. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1775.48s)]
*  That was fun. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1777.48s)]
*  That's the best Jets coach you ever had, right? [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1779.48s)]
*  By far. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1781.48s)]
*  Three years of Bill Parcells. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1783.48s)]
*  And Belichick on staff. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1785.48s)]
*  Yeah, painful test of early injury that colors this period. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1787.48s)]
*  Because otherwise this could have been a great team. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1789.48s)]
*  You know, I think I bet on them in the AFC title game. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1791.96s)]
*  Against the Broncos. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1793.96s)]
*  They were up 10-0 in that game. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1795.96s)]
*  At halftime it felt like they were going to win. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1797.96s)]
*  They were up. Keith Byers. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1799.96s)]
*  A bunch of weird shit happened. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1801.96s)]
*  Alright, so replaced by Al Groh. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1803.96s)]
*  Went 9-7 and then resigned to coach the University of Virginia. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1805.96s)]
*  Went to college. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1807.96s)]
*  So Al Groh, during this season, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1809.96s)]
*  bear in mind I'm a die hard Jets fan in college. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1811.96s)]
*  Or in high school at this time. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1813.96s)]
*  One of my close friends in high school starts dating Al Groh's sister. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1815.96s)]
*  And he's like, I'm going to go to college. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1817.96s)]
*  And he starts dating Al Groh's son the year he starts as the coach. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1820.44s)]
*  And when I met his son, who was a really nice guy, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1822.44s)]
*  I was like, brother, there's a lot riding on this hire. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1824.44s)]
*  Your dad better not fuck this up. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1826.44s)]
*  And he bailed in like 12 weeks. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1828.44s)]
*  He did. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1830.44s)]
*  And went back and went to UVA. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1832.44s)]
*  You know, I knew his brother, Wayne Groh. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1834.44s)]
*  Who, um, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1836.44s)]
*  He was, he was, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1838.44s)]
*  He was working with the crew and things went wrong. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1840.44s)]
*  We should have known. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1842.44s)]
*  And Al Groh wasn't to be trusted. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1844.44s)]
*  So then there was the best part. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1846.44s)]
*  So then there was the Belichick never actually hired. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1848.92s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1850.92s)]
*  Herm Edwards. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1852.92s)]
*  So I'm writing my column at that point. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1854.92s)]
*  And people like Herm Edwards. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1856.92s)]
*  Just content. Just filler. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1858.92s)]
*  One of the worst game management people [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1860.92s)]
*  who ever lived just seemed completely [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1862.92s)]
*  confused. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1864.92s)]
*  Like if they had all the stuff they had now [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1866.92s)]
*  of the analytics, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1868.92s)]
*  whether you should punt or got, Herm Edwards would have [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1870.92s)]
*  like, like broken the nerds. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1872.92s)]
*  He would like punt from his, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1874.92s)]
*  from the 34 yard line. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1876.92s)]
*  First year though of Herm. Did they not go to the playoffs? [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1878.92s)]
*  I think they might have. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1880.92s)]
*  He jumped to Kansas City. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1882.92s)]
*  Well, he went like 4 and 12. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1884.92s)]
*  Yeah, they were going to fire him. He jumped to Kansas City. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1886.92s)]
*  So he's gone. And you hire the man genius. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1888.92s)]
*  You hire Belichick's protege. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1890.92s)]
*  Who's really only [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1892.92s)]
*  legacy was he starts [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1894.92s)]
*  Spygate. Blows the whistle on Belichick. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1896.92s)]
*  Starts his Belichick blood feud. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1898.92s)]
*  That now is [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1900.92s)]
*  paying off against you because Belichick [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1902.92s)]
*  probably would have taken over the Jets if that never happened. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1904.92s)]
*  But Sean hates Belichick. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1906.92s)]
*  So he's fine. Belichick's like 300 [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1908.92s)]
*  years old. That's alright. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1910.92s)]
*  Man Genie, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1912.92s)]
*  I remember being really happy [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1914.92s)]
*  during that period and I feel like he got kind of [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1916.92s)]
*  short shrift. And I don't really fully [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1918.92s)]
*  understand what happened there. There were some good moments [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1920.92s)]
*  and then of course the brush off of the handshake [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1922.92s)]
*  with Belichick is legendary. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1924.92s)]
*  And then I know this sounds so [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1926.92s)]
*  wringer and like, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1928.92s)]
*  the soprano scene was a huge [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1930.92s)]
*  deal. It was a huge deal. When Artie Bucco [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1932.92s)]
*  was like, the man genius. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1934.92s)]
*  And they entered and it was like, he was in, it was like [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1936.92s)]
*  a crossover event. Like oh my god. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1938.92s)]
*  And everyone was like, oh we hate that coach. And they're like, we love that guy. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1940.92s)]
*  After one year. He was [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1942.92s)]
*  awesome with the Jets and then [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1944.92s)]
*  as it goes. So why, so he never worked [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1946.92s)]
*  again. No he went to Cleveland. He was the head coach [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1948.92s)]
*  with the Browns after. Oh that's right. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1950.92s)]
*  I had him on the podcast and I was still kind of pissed [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1952.92s)]
*  about Spygate. We talked it out. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1954.92s)]
*  I was about as [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1956.92s)]
*  I'm not, never adversarial [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1958.92s)]
*  whatever podcast guest that one. I was like, I had [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1960.92s)]
*  to. Yeah. And how did he handle it? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1962.92s)]
*  It was good. He actually was a pretty good guest. Does he talk about it openly? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1964.92s)]
*  Because I know he's on FS1 a bunch. I see him on like the first thing first. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1966.92s)]
*  But he still talks about it. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1968.92s)]
*  I think we talked about it a little bit. Yeah. Okay. Bill wait [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1970.92s)]
*  I have a question for you. Have you reconciled the fact [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1972.92s)]
*  that your six Super Bowl rings are built on a pile [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1974.92s)]
*  of Y's? And that you cheated your way [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1976.92s)]
*  to the top? You know what? They changed the rules in 07 [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1978.92s)]
*  and Belichick forgot. And it was [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1980.92s)]
*  just one game of cheating. And [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1982.92s)]
*  you know, we paid the price. First round pick. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1984.92s)]
*  What about the air pressure in those balls? [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1986.92s)]
*  Was that an issue? I seem to recall there was another controversy. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1988.92s)]
*  That was [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1990.92s)]
*  all the evidence is that [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1992.92s)]
*  they were full of shit on that one. Anyway. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1994.92s)]
*  I have a question. Sean, I know you're the [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1996.92s)]
*  movie guy, but I'm sure you've seen the clips. And Bill [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=1998.92s)]
*  any thoughts on the clips [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2000.92s)]
*  that have gone viral from the Aaron Hernandez [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2002.92s)]
*  television show of some of these acting [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2004.92s)]
*  bits of the Bronx guy? Are those real? They're real. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2006.92s)]
*  It's real. So Ryan Murphy's just [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2008.92s)]
*  never seen a football game before? [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2010.92s)]
*  It doesn't appear to be the case. He seems to be [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2012.92s)]
*  really comfortable with serial murderers [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2014.92s)]
*  and portraying them. Dumber he's on! [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2016.92s)]
*  For whatever reason, football players not working. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2018.92s)]
*  Wait, a couple more coaches. Rex [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2020.92s)]
*  Ryan's your second best. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2022.92s)]
*  That worked out great. Some great times. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2024.92s)]
*  Foot fetish scandal and then just kind of went [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2026.92s)]
*  sideways. He saved his job with a win [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2028.92s)]
*  the final game against Miami. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2030.92s)]
*  Brought back one more year after [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2032.92s)]
*  the... And then that year was like done. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2034.92s)]
*  Went into Belichick's house and beat him [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2036.92s)]
*  and talked all kinds of shit. No doubt. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2038.92s)]
*  That was a real thing. Probably the greatest [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2040.92s)]
*  jet moment in my life. Coach Buffalo. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2042.92s)]
*  Oh yeah, he went to Buffalo. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2044.92s)]
*  Todd Bowles [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2046.92s)]
*  went 10-6 [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2048.92s)]
*  in 2015. Missed the playoffs with Ryan [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2050.92s)]
*  Fitzpatrick as quarterback and they just [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2052.92s)]
*  missed the playoffs. Jets have been victims of this a few [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2054.92s)]
*  times. They were 11-5 [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2056.92s)]
*  the Castle year where I think the [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2060.92s)]
*  Dolphins... They all went 11-5. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2062.92s)]
*  And then this year they went [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2064.92s)]
*  10-6 and it's like they couldn't do anything in the [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2066.92s)]
*  postseason. So he was 10-6 in 15 [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2068.92s)]
*  and then the wheels came off just for the Jets [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2070.92s)]
*  in general. You're like 43 and 93 [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2072.92s)]
*  cents. But he was 9 and 23. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2074.92s)]
*  I remember in Jets Nation [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2076.92s)]
*  and we knew each other by [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2078.92s)]
*  then. People felt like the [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2080.92s)]
*  team... Like he wasn't that bad. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2082.92s)]
*  It was just the quarterback situation [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2084.92s)]
*  was such a disaster. The GM McHagman was [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2086.92s)]
*  like the great ire. Everyone had some. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2088.92s)]
*  They both lost their jobs. The Jets fans weren't [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2090.92s)]
*  like, God, get this guy out of here [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2092.92s)]
*  though, were they? I don't remember that. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2094.92s)]
*  I think by the end they were but that first [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2096.92s)]
*  season was the year when [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2098.92s)]
*  Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker were on the outside [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2100.92s)]
*  as their receivers. And they were [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2102.92s)]
*  incredible. That was the most exciting [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2104.92s)]
*  offensive team that they had. They had an over time win [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2106.92s)]
*  over the Patriots where Decker has a touchdown [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2108.92s)]
*  and Fitzpatrick hits him and it was like [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2110.92s)]
*  alright, this could work. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2112.92s)]
*  Then Adam Gase. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2114.92s)]
*  Who I don't even think is coaching [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2116.92s)]
*  anymore, right? Gase was [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2118.92s)]
*  living down in [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2120.92s)]
*  Alabama for a while. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2122.92s)]
*  I'm not sure what he's up to now. He's on the [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2124.92s)]
*  33rd team. He's an advisor. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2126.92s)]
*  He's not even coaching high school? He was making [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2128.92s)]
*  money from both the Dolphins and [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2130.92s)]
*  the Jets for many, many years. I think those contracts [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2132.92s)]
*  have probably expired but at one point he was double [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2134.92s)]
*  dipping with both teams having been fired [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2136.92s)]
*  by both teams with years left on both contracts. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2138.92s)]
*  And he's the worst of all of these [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2140.92s)]
*  coaches, right? Have you had a worst [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2142.92s)]
*  coach than Adam Gase? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2144.92s)]
*  He was wildly [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2146.92s)]
*  inept but he also was at [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2148.92s)]
*  a time when those rosters were really [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2150.92s)]
*  bad too. That was [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2152.92s)]
*  the tail end of the McHagman era. It was right [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2154.92s)]
*  before Joe Douglas came in for his last season. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2156.92s)]
*  You know, we haven't said [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2158.92s)]
*  have we even said the name Joe Douglas [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2160.92s)]
*  to this point? He's been there for four years. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2162.92s)]
*  Sixth year of his contract. Yeah. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2164.92s)]
*  If you look at his record, his record is actually a lot worse than [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2166.92s)]
*  Robert Salas though he did inherit an absolute [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2168.92s)]
*  disaster in that first Gase season. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2170.92s)]
*  But just honestly [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2172.92s)]
*  I'm not passing judgment. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2174.92s)]
*  It just seemed like there was something wrong with Adam Gase. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2176.92s)]
*  It was impossible to tell [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2178.92s)]
*  what convinced Christopher Johnson to hire him [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2180.92s)]
*  in the first place. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2182.92s)]
*  He had that famous press conference [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2184.92s)]
*  where he just seemed loopy. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2186.92s)]
*  He was a disaster from the [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2188.92s)]
*  very beginning. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2190.92s)]
*  And then Salas and then Ulbrich. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2192.92s)]
*  The Salas one is interesting because [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2194.92s)]
*  of that year and the way [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2196.92s)]
*  the coaches were all being interviewed. And I remember [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2198.92s)]
*  talking to you and I believe it was [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2200.92s)]
*  House at the time and you guys were all like, Salas [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2202.92s)]
*  of Detroit, right? And I remember saying [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2204.92s)]
*  maybe he's a local guy there but I know he's going to [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2206.92s)]
*  have other opportunities. And they hired [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2208.92s)]
*  Dan Campbell even before that. And everyone's like, Dan [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2210.92s)]
*  Campbell. And the irony is, here's Dan [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2212.92s)]
*  Campbell. Of all that crew, I wish we had the whole [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2214.92s)]
*  list but I think it was like [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2216.92s)]
*  Mike McDaniel, Robert Sala [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2218.92s)]
*  and then I remember Kingsbury [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2220.92s)]
*  interviewed with the Jets. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2222.92s)]
*  But Michael Bidwell had a plane waiting [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2224.92s)]
*  for him out there [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2226.92s)]
*  right afterwards. And it was like, if he gets on that plane [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2228.92s)]
*  he's going to Arizona. And Cliff [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2230.92s)]
*  went and took the Arizona job and [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2232.92s)]
*  had to get out of USC. But like that was [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2234.92s)]
*  a crazy year of who's going [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2236.92s)]
*  where. And Sala, I think a lot of Jets fans were happy with it. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2238.92s)]
*  Here's an all business, tough [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2240.92s)]
*  nose defensive coach and I think [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2242.92s)]
*  four years later it's over. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2244.92s)]
*  So, top [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2246.92s)]
*  three. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2248.92s)]
*  Top three Jets coaches. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2250.92s)]
*  Parcells won. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2252.92s)]
*  Yes, although [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2254.92s)]
*  Rex Ryan's too. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2256.92s)]
*  Rex got farther more consistently. I mean, Rex [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2258.92s)]
*  won two consecutive AFC championships. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2260.92s)]
*  And beat Peyton Manning and Tom Brady in playoff games. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2262.92s)]
*  Parcells changed the culture [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2264.92s)]
*  of the team. Parcells went and got Curtis Martin [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2266.92s)]
*  from the Pats. Like he, the Jets [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2268.92s)]
*  were a laughing stock and it felt like he fixed it. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2270.92s)]
*  Those Parcells teams were awesome. Like Richie Anderson. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2272.92s)]
*  Keith Byers. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2274.92s)]
*  They definitely had identity. Yeah, a lot of old school. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2276.92s)]
*  So who's the third best Jets coach of [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2278.92s)]
*  your lifetime then? This is sad. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2280.92s)]
*  Is it Al Groh for one year? [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2282.92s)]
*  I mean, he's the only one with a winning record, right? [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2284.92s)]
*  He went on in seven. That name means [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2286.92s)]
*  nothing to any Jet fan. It's like one year. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2288.92s)]
*  Is he the only one with a winning record aside [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2290.92s)]
*  from Parcells and Rex? [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2292.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2294.92s)]
*  So it's got to be Al Groh. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2296.92s)]
*  Can I ask you, you as a Jet fan, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2298.92s)]
*  because already fans, all my Jet fans, fans [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2300.92s)]
*  are texting me and it's like, do you want to go [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2302.92s)]
*  Vrabel Belichick style [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2304.92s)]
*  or would you want young, hot shot [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2306.92s)]
*  Ben Johnson, Cliff Kingsbury [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2308.92s)]
*  or hot shot college coach? Like [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2310.92s)]
*  where's your head now coming off the Sala era? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2312.92s)]
*  Well, this is complete [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2314.92s)]
*  wish casting. But I saw [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2316.92s)]
*  somebody pitch the idea of [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2318.92s)]
*  Mike Vrabel as head coach and Kevin [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2320.92s)]
*  Stefanski getting fired and [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2322.92s)]
*  coming in as the OC. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2324.92s)]
*  Now that is something I would love. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2326.92s)]
*  See, that is something I would love. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2328.92s)]
*  If Stefanski was available, I would put him on the Vrabel [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2330.92s)]
*  level. Yeah, it's fancy great. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2332.92s)]
*  By the way, the Stefanski thing, we're going to talk about [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2334.92s)]
*  it after Sean lose, but it's a little [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2336.92s)]
*  similar to Sala with Zach Wilson last year [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2338.92s)]
*  where you're playing the guy [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2340.92s)]
*  that they told you to play. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2342.92s)]
*  Yeah, like he clearly didn't have [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2344.92s)]
*  a choice. He didn't want to keep playing Zach Wilson. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2346.92s)]
*  I'm a big Kevin Stefanski [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2348.92s)]
*  fan as far as [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2350.92s)]
*  knowing how he operates in that building and how [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaxSVeqVvp4&t=2352.92s)]
