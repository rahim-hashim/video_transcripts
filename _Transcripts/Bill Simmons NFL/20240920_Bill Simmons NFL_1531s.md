# Five Favorite Hottest NFL Takes After Two Weeks With Steven Ruiz  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7BLRRbp7sw)
*  Alright, so you're here for your
*  your
*  Five hottest takes two weeks into this season. We're gonna go in reverse order. We're playing five favorites
*  Your five favorite takes number five is what?
*  I'm gonna go Jalen hurts isn't a top ten quarterback dot dot dot in the NFC. I
*  Don't think he's a top ten quarterback in the NFC now. I am I will say one thing
*  I am reaching a little bit here because the tenth guy
*  I don't really know if he's better than Jalen hurts, but I'm like 85% confident in this take that he's not a top ten quarterback
*  Wow, so who did who did you have against him for the tenth spot that was on the bubble Baker Mayfield?
*  I'll throw Kirk in there too because I don't know we don't know what Kirk is
*  We still don't know what Kirk's gonna be coming back from the injury
*  But I think if like Kirk gets back to 95% of what he was last year before the injury
*  I think he's he's definitely better than Jalen hurts at this point
*  But Baker is the one that I kind of I have a hard time putting them over hurts and only because hurts
*  Provides as a runner and we saw that on Monday like when the the offense was totally neutered
*  He couldn't do anything in the pocket. He couldn't do anything in the passing game, but he could scramble
*  So he always has that like trump card he can go to I don't think Baker has that and I think when Baker tries to
*  Play that trump card
*  That's when you see the worst of Baker when he tries to do too much
*  But all these other guys like I'm confident saying that they're better than him every quarterback in the NFC West
*  I would take over him right now and I'm not a Brock Purdy guy as everyone knows not a Brock Purdy guy
*  but I think he allows you to run a certain style of offense that hurts just doesn't allow you to run at this point and
*  I'm trying to think of the other guys where I kind of you know, it's 50-50 for me like Jared Goff
*  I feel like is definitely better than him Jordan love definitely better Dak definitely better Derek Carr
*  I think it's easier to say now after the first two weeks, but I probably would have thought about it before
*  Yeah, that's
*  Well, let me say this. What does he do better than Derek Carr? That's my one thing
*  I don't think he's a better thrower than him
*  I think I I think Jalen hurts is one of the more overrated throwers because he's so good at running the football
*  We assume that he's also good at throwing on the run
*  But when you like look at his stats and you watch the tape
*  He's one of the worst throwers on the run that like in the league
*  He's very stiff as a as a he's almost like an action figure where his joints can only move in certain directions
*  And I think you need some like hip flexibility to be able to throw on the run and he doesn't have it
*  The short yardage stuff with him is great
*  Two years ago. I thought he was good enough that my
*  2023 fantasy strategy was just to try to get as many Eagles as possible and then watched him all last year
*  And it just seemed like he was off and it's like well, he must have been hurt
*  Yeah, I watched this week and it's like alright, he's moving a little better
*  But it doesn't explain some of the pocket stuff and then you pull out one weapon and they were just struggling to do anything down the field
*  I mean they I
*  It's a team that I certainly am excited to think about going against this week
*  the cousins thing is interesting because the Eagles never touched him and
*  I still don't know if it's there's two Kirk cousins. It's like Kirk cousins with protection
*  Her cousins under duress I still Kirk cousins under duress. I would have below her
*  No, I agree with that, but I think like Jalen hurts puts himself under duress
*  More often than Kirk cousins puts himself on under dirt like Kirk
*  Huns is gonna stand in the pocket for two seconds
*  And if there's if there's no pressure before that the ball's gonna come out
*  Jalen hurts is gonna stand in the pocket for two seconds
*  Look at one read and then start to look around and see where he can exit the pocket and then he runs into pressure
*  You don't have to worry about that with Kirk, but there's also like a downside to that
*  He's not gonna create anything out of structure. He's not gonna scramble
*  He's not gonna throw on the run outside of the outside of structure
*  So it's really an artist from who would you take for fist pumps cousins had a great one on Monday night?
*  Cuz when I got to go ahead touchdown or the close to whatever the late touchdown and he did the he does the stare at the
*  sidelines
*  Because he's a contrived leader. I'll say that I think he's the only quarterback that pre writes his pregame speeches
*  You know how like the quarterbacks do the pregame?
*  Performs I think he performs them in the mirror like I think his wife's like let's know what's working
*  What's not working what he has to switch out? Yeah, take that second graph out
*  I just think you just go from the first graph the third go
*  I think Kirk does that I know for a fact that Russell Wilson does that like I don't have any inside information
*  But I know he uses chat bot whatever chat chat GbT
*  He's in uniform when he when he practices it too, so I mean obviously these are hottest takes I
*  Find it hard to push back against this hurts thing unless he starts playing better
*  Because they've given him
*  This year the line isn't as good as it was last year, but he's always had a good line. He's always had weapons
*  He's got Barkley this year who's I still think one of the five best running backs
*  Just seems like a team that should be able to score points and Atlanta had them pretty flummoxed anyway alright. What's number four?
*  All right number four I'm gonna have to explain this one because it's gonna sound crazy off the top
*  Andy Reid is no longer a top five play caller in the league right now I
*  Think that's what he's known for I still think he's a little bit of a my feet. Okay. Let's hear it
*  They're at 12th and EPA since last year
*  They have not figured out how to throw the deep ball even though they have one of the most talented quarterbacks
*  We've ever seen that throwing the deep ball over the last like three years. I think it went away
*  Tyreeks final year and now we're on year two without Tyreeks, and they still don't have a reliable explosive passing game
*  Yeah, the run game is up and down the screen game is up and down
*  And then one thing that I think he's lost that I don't know if anyone's caught up to it yet is you remember when he
*  Would ask Andy Reid off the buy was always like the scariest thing any read? Oh, he never loses off the buy
*  They always you know put up a bunch of points off the buy the last three years
*  They've won two of the games, but one of those games they went to overtime against Malik Willis's Titans and scored 22 points
*  And then the other game they scored 20 points against Teddy Bridgewater's Broncos and barely won that game
*  Those were two struggle wins and then last year they scored 17 to Philly. I watched the tape and I'm never thinking like oh
*  He's making Patrick Mahomes job easier. Like oh he created that wide open guy running down the seam
*  Oh, he created that wide open crosser running down the seam. It's usually Mahomes kind of
*  Overcoming the weaknesses of the the person all around them. They haven't had two good offensive tackles in years
*  They haven't had like a strong receiving core in a couple years
*  Kelsey has been good, but I don't think he I think he's been kind of washed the last couple years
*  I think it's all Mahomes right now, but I will say this
*  I think any read is still a top five coach, but it's more about like the program
*  Like the CEO infrastructure. Yeah, yeah, like like the ramp up to the season. They played their guys in preseason
*  They're never cold to start the year
*  They get off to a hot start and that kind of gives them a buffer
*  And then also the other thing is like the freedom he gives Mahomes and Kelsey and those receivers to kind of improvise in between plays
*  And like take ownership of the offense
*  I think it's like the opposite of Kyle Shanahan on the other side of the spectrum of Kyle Shanahan
*  And I think that kind of makes the Chiefs offense as good as it is despite
*  the lack of structure we've seen the last couple years, so I do give them credit for that
*  I'm taking guys like Sean McVeigh, Kyle Shanahan, Ben Johnson, Shane Stiken even in terms of just like play calling
*  Who's the guy on the headset sending in the play to the quarterback? I'm taking all those guys ahead of him
*  I think reads kind of lost it in that area. Can I zag on your take?
*  Yeah, maybe regular season Andy Reid is not a top five play caller anymore, but I still feel like he's a top five player
*  Yeah, maybe regular season Andy Reid is not a top five play caller anymore
*  But I still feel like he saves stuff for the playoffs because he knows they're gonna be there
*  And it's almost like a stand-up comic who's going to the Comedy Store and he's doing his bit
*  But he knows the Netflix specials coming and that's gonna be his best hour
*  So I feel like he's more in workshop mode. They know they're gonna win 12 or 13 games
*  Right, right, you know, I have a take off your take about play calling
*  So I've noticed this with offensive coordinators that have a lot of smoke blowing up their asses like Ben Johnson did last year
*  that that week to performance which house and I talked about earlier a million dollar picks with the
*  with throwing 55 times with Jared Goff and it was almost like oh
*  Look at all those injuries on Tampa. Oh, I'm gonna do this instead
*  And I I actually thought that was a really badly called game because all they had to do was just run the ball
*  And I don't think Tampa would have stopped them and sometimes the Lions are built to run the ball run the ball run the ball
*  Play action and that's who they are
*  I don't know what would make you think you should throw the ball 55 times. It was like Tampa Jedi mind trick them
*  To do that and then they did it and and they lost so I don't know. I'm at ben johnson's on my watch list
*  I think that's fair for him to be on your watch list
*  I think anytime you are an up-and-coming OC and it's only been two years since you've been considered like a great one
*  But I'm trying to show it. Yeah, the best yeah
*  I think that's part of it and I think the best ones are the ones that like they start out good
*  They hit a wall and then they bounce back they find an adjustment like we've seen that with Sean McVay
*  I think we've seen it with Kyle Shanahan to a certain extent
*  You don't really know about a play caller until that second act until they have to yes until they get beaten down and they
*  Come back like of course the play calling is gonna be good two years in a row
*  He's working with the same personnel like he still has that offensive line
*  That's that's always a funny thing to me is like like even a guy like Purdy and I'm not trying to shit on Purdy right now
*  But he's just the best example like people are like alright if Purdy does it again like he's proven
*  He's the guy well
*  He's still in that office and he still has those superstars around him and he starts gosh and calling play like he's not really proving
*  Anything differently than he did like I expect him to have a big year again
*  So I think you could say the same thing about Ben Johnson
*  Who is working with the best offensive line in the NFL?
*  Which I think like if I'm an offensive coordinator outside of quarterback
*  That's the first thing I want is like the offensive line that allows power to do anything
*  I think one thing that bothers me with play cars
*  You saw this the other night the Eagles lose that game because they run
*  What seemed to be the perfect screen pass to Barkley and then he drops it?
*  it's like well the play was there the play was the right play and it's like
*  Yeah, was it because you were running the ball really for whatever you wanted
*  You're throwing a Barkley in the flat and if you talk to literally any Giants fan
*  They'd be like used to drop that pass all the time as great as he is and he's an awesome running back
*  But it's not there's three things that can go wrong in that pass right it get tipped the quarterback can fuck up the throw
*  Barkley can drop it. It's so there's real variable even if the guys open there's still variables
*  Yeah, but running the ball twice on third and three where you know
*  You have the tush push to which they haven't stopped all night, and you're keeping the clock going I
*  Think I'm top of like a drop screen pass stop the clock
*  So there's that actually was a horrible call and I couldn't believe people were debating it the next day no no
*  It was actually the right call. He was open so no
*  I wasn't I agree with you like the problem the result was ultimately good like
*  Saquon Barkley wide open if he catches it's a first down, but like the process going into it
*  I agree with you
*  It was not like the sharpest process and like if if the defense at the Falcons have a guy in the flat there
*  Then then what happens that plate looks a lot worse than they were questioned like right?
*  Why the hell would he give Jalen hurts the opportunity to hold on the ball and take another sack and you know I just don't
*  Want I don't want any scenario?
*  Where the clock might stop when there's a minute 40 left the other team doesn't have any timeouts, and I'm already up three
*  I'm not taking any chance stop in the clock. I was they don't lead into the tush push thing enough like I'd be right
*  I agree. It's two yards a play. Why not three? I'd run it. I don't I don't understand that
*  What do you got for number three all right?
*  The ring India Reid one was I there's gonna be some angry Chiefs fan, but that's that's the whole point of hottest take
*  I don't mind alright. This one's gonna get a fan base angry Gino Smith is better than Joe burrow right now I
*  Mean his his late game stuff speaks for itself
*  As any quarterback been better in the last in the fourth quarter of games in the last year plus two games
*  And I'll take it a step further like Gino Smith is the quarterback that people want you to believe Joe burrow is like
*  Stylistically and you watch them back to back your your Patriots fan you watch them back to back you watch Joe burrow and Gino Smith
*  They're running the same style of offense which is like yeah get in the gun spread things out. We're not gonna call play action
*  We're not gonna run the ball. You just got to read things out like you're like prime. Jubre's are 2007 Tom Brady
*  It's not working in Cincinnati and hasn't been working for the last year
*  It's working really well in Seattle right now, and you watch those two games back-to-back I
*  Think like the environment is the same in terms of protection in terms of receivers getting open the differences Gino
*  Smith is making throws into tight windows downfield like anticipating throws and being a quarterback the field general quote-unquote
*  That you want to see whereas Joe burrow is kind of checking down early
*  He's not holding on to the ball. I think he's making bad reads that we didn't see him make before
*  I think he's kind of pressing and trying to be this guy that he's been built up to be and it's not working without the
*  Support without T Higgins out there meanwhile Gino Smith has been placed in that same situation that I think he's thriving
*  No weapons for the Bengals other than chase
*  I'm just saying for these first couple games
*  Yeah, I agree on the burrow part like they they had the ball the chance to just close out KC in the fourth quarter that
*  game right and they didn't get a first down they had to give back to them and
*  I
*  He hasn't jumped off the screen like he did a couple years ago
*  But my thing is like he took a team in the Super Bowl
*  he's won huge games in places like Arrowhead and
*  I'm not willing to panic yet, but he has had a couple injuries at this point
*  And that that's the part that makes you think like
*  It's definitely like it's a concern
*  Especially when like you came into the league without like these like great physical gifts like I don't think his is you know
*  Athleticism was bad his arm was bad, but like you talked to GM's and maybe this is old-school thinking
*  But the reason why they love big quarterbacks they compare it to like car insurance
*  But you get a big car big SUV like the insurance
*  It isn't as expensive you get a small sleek sports car. You have to pay a lot of insurance. It's the same thing with quarterbacks
*  Some of these quarterbacks they take a hit and it affects them for five years a guy like Josh Allen
*  Like you know, he takes a hit and he's fine. He continues to play but he gives the hit. Yeah, like we saw
*  Just a calf injury what it did to Joe burrow last year like it turned him into 40 year old Ben Rothenberger
*  I don't mean that as a compliment and then you TV 12 diet might be in his future
*  Yeah, yeah, man that might be next step for him. Yeah, and like Tom Brady is like the
*  The guy that you look to if you're one of these like lesser athletes because Tom Brady got better as an athlete as his career went on
*  I think he needs a witch doctor Alex Carrero. Maybe we need to hire him bring Alex Carrero in in Cincinnati
*  I don't think Mike Brown would pay for that though. That's the I liked I actually liked coming out of that
*  I talked about this Sunday night, even though they're Owen too
*  I like their situation a little more than the Ravens because I like that. They talk shit all week
*  I think they still carry themselves like they're good. Yeah
*  They still have good pieces the Higgins thing like when he comes back all the sudden the team looks different
*  But I agree with you burrow doesn't seem exactly the same. What's your number two?
*  My number two is Bill Belichick is gonna be coaching the Jaguars next season and we'll know it by New Year's
*  Like it won't be official
*  But it will be the worst kept secret in the NFL that Joe that Bill Belichick is gonna be the next coach of the Jaguars
*  the Jaguars, okay, my mind
*  Okay, why well first of all, I know some beat reporters down in Jacksonville and I think you know
*  There's already whispers there. I'll start with that
*  But I'm not gonna
*  I'll go somewhere else with to prove it
*  I think like the way shot Khan is kind of ramping up his coaching hirings
*  Like he starts with like the no-name GM who are no name defensive coordinator and Gus Bradley that doesn't work out
*  No, no talent defensive coordinator
*  What are the worst?
*  What are the worst?
*  He goes with Doug Morrone. He goes the other side another, you know assistant and then he goes for the splash hire
*  He goes with Irvin Meyer the guy who's won, but he hasn't won at this level
*  But he hasn't won at this level. Yeah, then he goes to Doug Peterson splash. That was a body overboard being thrown off a boat splash
*  Yeah, that was that was awful. And then the next one is Doug Peterson the guy that's won at this level
*  But hasn't done it consistently the one who hasn't like done it again
*  I think next to line is is Bill Belichick and then my the real reason why I believe this
*  Is because like we talked about earlier like shot Khan is a hands-off owner. I
*  Don't think he's gonna get spooked like Atlanta did when Bill Belichick comes in and goes
*  I want to run the organization like this. I want to have GM powers. I want to be able to hire my own coordinators
*  I want to be able to like
*  Decide the the direction of this franchise. I don't think he's gonna get spooked by that. I think he's gonna like that
*  I think he's gonna want it and then if if Belichick comes in and he throws those rings on the table
*  I think that's enough. I think shot Khan needs a proven winner
*  Someone where he can't get blamed for hiring the coach where it doesn't fall back on him because if you hire Belichick, it doesn't work out
*  It's like yeah, he's the greatest coach ever. Yeah
*  He's like mad that you hired Bill Belichick. So first of all, I forgot how many coaches the Jaguars you've had
*  That was that was a pretty great list
*  Second they're a bottom three worst coach team of the of the first
*  Two weeks. I it's just stunning that they lost both of those games and how stupid they were over and over again
*  It really made me mad third
*  Belichick taking a job from Doug Peterson
*  There's a poetic justice to that since Doug Peterson's soul is Super Bowl and fourth
*  Old guy moving to Florida it adds up. It's perfect. It's like
*  This is old people go to Florida. It's a Belichick just goes there. I had him go to the Giants though
*  I thought that that one in my head made the most sense because he's you know, that's where he made his bones
*  He won his first Super Bowl
*  The history of the Giants. Yeah
*  He's always talked fondly of them Lawrence Taylor Phil Sims the whole thing
*  Yeah
*  When he goes back there, I think there was like an NFL film thing like following him throughout the season he went back there
*  He's like getting emotional and tearing up. Yeah
*  He loves the Giants and it feels like that's gonna be a complete reboot reall after this year
*  But if you have Trevor Lawrence in place you have the quarterback there
*  You just have to develop him and make sure like he's not surrounded by
*  Just terrible coaching and then you compare that to the Giants quarterback situation, which is like what do we do?
*  We're drafting should or Sanders are we drafting Carson Beck like I
*  Think like that is the deciding factor. I don't know if this is the week to say they have Trevor Lawrence in place and
*  I have the most Trevor Lawrence stock right now. I have bets on him. Don't four thousand yards
*  I have my two fantasy teams. I bet on him two straight weeks. I have a lot of concerns
*  I know I'm gonna be like I thought this is gonna be the breakout year and it's been the opposite
*  It's been my face is breaking out from betting on him. I know I'm gonna be like the tape guy
*  They'll like take my word for it. Like you gotta wash the tape
*  It's like oh, it's terrible for him. He's actually playing. He's actually playing well, but like I don't know what to say
*  I watch it and I'm like, it's not his fault like the no one's open and when they're open
*  They drop the pass and when and when they do get open the the pass rush gets there and like it's just a poorly coached
*  Team I think it really constructed team to like Trent Bocke. I don't I don't know how he survived the urban minor situation
*  That's insane to me. He's he's like the cockroach of the NFL. You'll be happy to know a million dollar picks
*  We took the Jaguars for the third straight week week after after we had rants on Sunday night
*  I'm ranting about how stupid they are. I hate myself. I'm never taking them again. And now the line in Buffalo's
*  I had I had them in my survival pool last week. So I'm with Jesus. All right, your number one hottest take is
*  This isn't my hottest take but it's it's something like everyone's been talking about
*  I don't know if you saw Mel Kuyper talking about banning too high or whatever because the scoring down but like I think the most obvious
*  Explanation for why the scoring gap the scoring is down is because all the good offenses are being wasted on mediocre to average
*  Quarterbacks and all the good quarterbacks are stuck in mediocre to average offenses. I think that's the biggest explanation
*  We have Jalen Hurts wasting
*  Philadelphia supporting cast we have Baker Mayfield in Tampa Bay where he has Mike Evans and Chris Godwin and one of the better play
*  Callers to start the season. We have golf wasting that that offensive line. Sometimes we have Brock Purdy
*  I think he's playing well, but if you put Patrick Bahomes in that offense, they're scoring 50 points a game and scoring is right back up
*  We have two in Miami
*  Darnold is in Minnesota with that supporting cast and then you look at the other side look at the top of the league like Josh
*  Allen is throwing a Khalil Shakir. He's his best receiver
*  Patrick Bahomes best receiver is a fourth like a 38 year old tight end and his second best receiver is fate facing eight felony charges
*  They just signed Kareem Hunt to help out the writing game has been dead for three years
*  Yeah, they're they're they're great. Hope is Hollywood Brown coming back. Yeah, Justin Herbert another bad situation Trevor Lawrence
*  We just talked about another bad situation Burroughs got one receiver Burroughs got one receiver and he's hurt all the time Jack Prescott like that
*  Mike McCarthy is I can't believe he's getting away with this for a second straight year
*  Especially as the play call now that he's the play caller and we can like evaluate what he's bringing to the table
*  I'm surprised Jerry Jones didn't move on from last our last offseason, but Jack Prescott
*  He's been put in a bad situation
*  So we have like these top quarterbacks kind of overcoming their environment
*  I'm gonna cause an effect that we're always because like you're paying so much for your quarterback. It's not like you can then
*  Get 70 weapons for him, you know, you're the the biggest most expensive quarterbacks. They're 40 or 50 million bucks a year
*  So now you have to like try to patch it together and grab Curtis Samuel and Shakir and that's those are your receivers
*  And hope you get lucky with James Cook
*  I do think that's part of it, but a lot of these guys just signed their deal
*  So it hasn't really taken effect and like a lot and some of the other guys like golf is making 50 million
*  To a million Baker Mayfield's making 35 million
*  Like these other guys are getting paid to the Derek Carr is making 30 million and he's benefiting from a great supporting cast right now
*  So I think that's really the issue and I think there's other issues that obviously factor into it
*  I think the O line thing like the O lines aren't good anymore. I think that has to do with it
*  I do think like playing more too high coverages and not selling out to stop the run that also helps
*  But like that's been a thing for the entire NFL like the 70 Steelers were the original cover to you
*  You know that the thing that's changed the most is the preseason in the practice time which just doesn't exist anymore
*  They got I couldn't believe this because I don't follow the preseason
*  They nobody plays but that Bryce Young really only played like one series in the preseason
*  How do you not have that dude out there for three quarters a game trying to build his confidence up against four stringers
*  But you're just saving him for the season. He hasn't done anything
*  Well, it turns out he's a four stringer too, but it's like Michael Penneck's not playing is just right mind
*  But that's anymore that's a more sinister though. I think they yeah
*  Yeah, they didn't want a situation where he was awesome in preseason
*  They'd obviously seen Kirk at that point and that he couldn't really move and it's I think
*  That was like let's leave Caitlin Clark off the Olympic team because everybody's gonna be talking about her the whole time
*  Even though she probably belonged but I think that's the biggest reason
*  I don't think it has to do with like this too high coverage thing because like people have been playing those coverages forever
*  Like yeah, he was playing it. Let me Smith was playing it like that's not what it is
*  It's I do think like the post 2011 CBA is a different league than it was beforehand. No question
*  You can feel it when you watch all the games the timing just seems off
*  Constantly like constantly in every game you're watching. It's like oh that guy fucked that up. Oh that seemed up up false start
*  Oh that guy jumped too soon
*  And it just feels choppy and look at the talent at the quarterback position. We have like I don't I don't know if
*  Just name a random
*  I don't know if Jack Prescott is better than whoever was the fifth best quarterback in 1995
*  But like the quarterbacks didn't have this
*  Well rounded skill set even even the top guys like Peyton Manning wasn't doing what Lamar Jackson is doing for his team
*  Yeah, could it be the run game? He couldn't scramble if you the thing on Brady was like if you get pressure up the middle
*  He's cooked like you can't step up in the pocket
*  He's no long you get you you get pressure up the middle on Patrick Mahomes. It doesn't matter
*  He just you know, he rolls out and he finds an open guy anyway
*  And I think that's more common now and we don't see as much as like the limited skill set like even Brock
*  Purdy I'm gonna give Brock Purdy some credit the reason why he's better than Jimmy G
*  Is he's not a statue like he's willing to make a play and he makes plays out of structure all the time
*  If Jimmy G was in that Lions NFC title game, they lose that game
*  Well, that's why I can't wait when the Pats finally unleashed the Drake May monster in week five, which I'm hoping
*  His ability to escape a pass rush create extra time. We I don't know if we've had that as a Patriots fan. I
*  Don't know if I've ever had it because even like blood so he couldn't really move around Brady could buy time in the pocket
*  But he wasn't a rollout. I'm gonna do side. I've just never rooted for somebody who could do that
*  So yeah Brady actually hated that stuff. There's like a coaching clinic
*  You don't want to get hit Bill O'Brien was like, yeah
*  We we could have done this stuff with Brady was like I don't want to do this
*  So we you know, you catered Tom Brady's Tom Brady
*  But yeah, that's it just wasn't a thing back in the day
*  Like you didn't have these guys that could be so much of your offense and maybe that's part of it too
*  Like we're putting so much on these quarterbacks and expecting them to like patch up all this other stuff
*  That's why we're paying them so much money. It's just hard. It's a 53 man roster. It's a 22 man sport. It's really hard
