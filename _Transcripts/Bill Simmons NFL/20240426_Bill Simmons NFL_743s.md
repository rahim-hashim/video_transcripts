# What Are the Falcons Doing Drafting Michael Penix? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [April 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kw7DsHoheQ)
*  The Falcons took Michael Penex with the eighth pick in the draft.
*  Every once in a while, the NFL draft reminds us no matter how many mock traps you do,
*  no matter how many experts you listen to, something fucked up is going to happen.
*  This was a fucked up thing because they just spent all this money on Kirk Cousins.
*  It feels like a team that's pretty close to really competing in the NFC with a couple moves.
*  And now they spent the eighth pick on a backup quarterback.
*  I don't get it.
*  It's a drama factory.
*  You have a guy in the league, veteran, a proven quarterback.
*  Not an elite quarterback, but a proven quarterback.
*  And you think you're tooling up to make a go at it, and then you bring in youth.
*  And we're all sitting here, we're watching the draft, and no sooner is that pick made
*  than you start to hear rumblings that he's actually, I think the word is stunned.
*  Stunned.
*  That they went for Michael Penex.
*  Disappointed, I think, was the other word.
*  And so this is the thing.
*  You wonder with a pick like this, number one, with a player like Michael Penex who
*  has all the talent in the world, had a really strong combine and pro day,
*  if they just fell in love with him so much for whatever reason that they had to draft him,
*  no matter how it would shake their organization up, and despite, obviously,
*  the huge medical concerns that he has.
*  You love Michael Penex.
*  Love him.
*  So make the case that this was actually a great move to do this.
*  Because by the time he actually starts for them after Cousins is
*  out, which would be a couple years from now, Michael Penex will be 34 years old.
*  Well, he is older.
*  He's yet another one of these transfer guys.
*  And look, he's had significant, significant medical issues.
*  Two torn ACLs, same knee, shoulder surgery.
*  You guys have seen it all.
*  They ran it down on the draft.
*  But look, if there was a world where you could say Michael Penex is going to be healthy
*  and he's not going to have any injury problems, and obviously that's a huge conjecture
*  given his past, yo, he can just fucking ball.
*  He can throw the ball down the field beautifully.
*  He puts the ball in pockets and in windows with amazing touch and accuracy.
*  He's like a Drew Brees type of quarterback.
*  While he was at Washington in college, he just it's almost like he's handing the ball
*  off down there.
*  Anticipatory throws a hole nine.
*  And then plus all of that, his knees seem to be holding up.
*  His legs seem to be holding up.
*  His body seems to be holding up well enough for him to go four or five at the combine,
*  which I think shocked everybody.
*  But he doesn't really run as a quarterback, though.
*  So what do I care if he runs for six?
*  If you're not actually running, he's not running.
*  But the fact that he can still move.
*  Yeah.
*  And the fact that his body is functional and working, I think that explosion and that
*  type of speed was surprising to a lot of people who had heard that he was essentially held
*  together by thumbtacks and chewing gum throughout his college season.
*  You know, well, he tore the same ACL on his right knee twice.
*  That means the second one was a cadaver ACL, maybe bad cadaver.
*  Or maybe it's like rookie of the year.
*  Remember when rookie of the year when he got hurt and then all of a sudden that made
*  him throw harder than anybody right there.
*  It just got stronger and better.
*  Stronger is like they put the rookie of the year ligament in there.
*  Now he's like the man.
*  But look, here's the thing.
*  If their plan is to not play him for a while, make sure that his body can take the load
*  of an NFL season, give him a look-see for a couple of years and then turn it over to
*  him, it's a very smart draft pick.
*  The reality is that it's one of the riskier draft picks that I can remember somebody making
*  right now.
*  Like would a new QB coming in and with the team as close to continuing as you said.
*  And one of the funnier draft picks.
*  Nobody thought it was gonna happen.
*  I love when there's though, and I said we were watching with a couple of people and
*  they showed him like three, four minutes before the pick.
*  And I immediately got suspicious because I thought the Falcons were in trade out of
*  that.
*  They were such a logical trade candidate for somebody to come up and get JJ McCarthy.
*  And instead they were staying put.
*  And then they're just showing him in his living room with his family and you want to
*  talk about the families later.
*  You have some thoughts.
*  I have some theories.
*  Tough night.
*  But it was like, I was like, I think they're gonna take Penex.
*  But I said it the same way you would say, like if you're at a bar and one of your buddies
*  was talking all night to somebody, we're like that that lady's 25 years older than him.
*  I think he's going to go home with her.
*  I think she just paid the check.
*  Right.
*  And then that was it.
*  They took it.
*  You hate the Falcons.
*  We should mention this.
*  Yeah.
*  With the seeding white hot passion.
*  So this must have delighted you.
*  They wasted all their cap on Kirk Cousins and then they
*  spent the eighth pick on a backup quarterback.
*  So here's the thing.
*  This is why the draft is sometimes tough for huge college football fans.
*  Yeah.
*  It's tough because you get connected to the players and their stories over three or four
*  or in the case of both Knicks, 12 seasons that they've been playing.
*  Then all of a sudden they get drafted to your moral enemy.
*  Yeah.
*  I want to see Michael Pinnix do well because it's just such a fantastic story.
*  You even defending his performance in the playoff game, which was not good.
*  So look, he played against in Michigan, what I believe to be a top three, if not the best
*  defense in college football.
*  And they had them schemed up.
*  They played them really well.
*  It was a hard hitting, very physical defense.
*  He didn't.
*  Well, he diced Texas up, bad secondary, but he diced Texas up.
*  Okay.
*  And all throughout the year, except for a couple of games where he just kind of led
*  them to victories and didn't really dominate.
*  Michael Pinnix was the offense for Washington.
*  Obviously he had some great guys on the outside, but he was the engine of the whole team.
*  He played fantastic football.
*  He played fantastic football.
*  So like he made me a believer in college.
*  He's a long time.
*  Like a lot of guys, all of these guys are all the fourth, 15th, six years, 25 year old
*  rookies, the whole nine.
*  That's the way the world now, Bill.
*  Can you walk us through a couple of years here in the city of Atlanta where you have
*  Kirk Cousins as the incumbent and Michael Pinnix as the backup, how that might play out?
*  So I want to walk you through it, but I can't do better than a meme that I saw.
*  Okay.
*  What's that?
*  There's a little movie called even any given Sunday.
*  And this is where Dennis Quaid played cap.
*  The old veteran QB who had led the team to glory in the past.
*  You know, this was the first rewatchable we ever did after heat.
*  True.
*  Any given Sunday.
*  Any given Sunday was a one.
*  Any given Sunday, some shocking locker room scenes there.
*  Some shocking drug use.
*  Shocking drug use.
*  Some shocking all kinds of things.
*  So you're going to say that Cousins is cap.
*  And Pinnix is Willie Beeman.
*  And that that I mean, we're not there yet because we haven't seen Pinnix like
*  outperform and like take his job, but that type of locker room animus,
*  especially if Cousins is already there.
*  Now look, Kirk Cousins has a decision to make.
*  He can either try to nuke this kid in an Aaron Rodgers, Jordan Love type of way.
*  He's too nice of a guy.
*  I don't see him doing that.
*  I don't see him doing that.
*  However, the choice to, I guess, talk about or discuss or lead to the media,
*  your displeasure at the pick is an interesting one.
*  If you wanted to go with the flow and not rock the boat too much,
*  you would think that you would stay away from any public criticism of the pick itself.
*  Not saying that he came out and went on a record,
*  but obviously if it got out how he felt about it, he knows that it got out.
*  So he can't you can't win with any scenario of your Kirk Cousins.
*  If you're like, no, I think it's a great pick,
*  but I can't wait to work with Michael.
*  People are like, you're full of shit.
*  Yeah, I mean, who are you kidding?
*  But to me, it's just sometimes you tell the lies that you have to tell.
*  Hey, I can't wait to show this kid how to be a great pro.
*  I can't wait to get in there and make sure Michael Pinnix has.
*  We know that he doesn't mean it, but letting people know now
*  that he's not feeling okay with it makes it a story going into mini camps
*  and going into OTAs and going into training camp in the summer.
*  So the city of Atlanta, you gave me on the one hand a Dennis Quaid character
*  and then you gave me a Jamie Foxx character.
*  Where do you think the city is going to lean?
*  Let me tell you something.
*  I wonder how it's going to play out.
*  Let me tell you something real quick.
*  Atlanta loves a winner.
*  Okay.
*  And I think that's going to be a problem for Kurt Cousins.
*  Kurt Cousins is a good QB, but he's a nine and seven, nine and eight guy.
*  He is a 10 and seven ranger.
*  He is the cream of the crap, the best of the worst.
*  Now, I'm not hating on him because he's had a great career,
*  but I don't think anybody is looking to Kurt Cousins to take you to the promised land.
*  Now, if he goes in there and he has problems figuring out a little bit,
*  there are going to be people that want to see the new kid.
*  That's the thing.
*  And not just because he is culturally, should I say what Atlanta is looking for,
*  just because he just came off a fantastic college football career.
*  The Netflix series really helped Cousins.
*  I've been saying that for a while.
*  It made people forget that he's just a, basically it's slightly over 500 quarterback.
*  Who doesn't really do well in the playoffs and the Minnesota thing was fine.
*  Coming off an Achilles to boot, maybe wonder if they think he's going to be 100% healthy.
*  Maybe they wanted insurance.
*  Maybe they were worried about something.
*  The question is, is Kurt Cousins a quarterback?
*  I think everybody knows the answer now that you think you can win with
*  or is he Gardner Mentschew plus?
*  Meaning a quarterback that's a stop gap that comes in.
*  Or is he Dak Prescott?
*  Well, I mean Dak Prescott.
*  A stop gap.
*  Well, Dak Prescott, they built the whole fucking thing around him.
*  They think they're the same guy.
*  I've been saying this for years.
*  You think Prescott and the same guy, same level of success, same stats.
*  Yeah, true.
*  It's just one guy plays in Dallas and the other guy was on Minnesota and a couple other teams.
*  I think the only difference with Dak Prescott is he really put the team in a real bind to where
*  he fails just enough to ruin your franchise.
*  Yeah.
*  If you commit that type of money and make that type of commitment to obviously a guy,
*  I'm not like rewriting or saying anything profound here to a guy like Dak Prescott.
*  You almost have to win and he just hasn't demonstrated that at all.
*  Kurt Cousins was different.
*  It's one of the more unique careers ever.
*  A bunch of different franchise tags.
*  There wasn't a real commitment to him.
*  Kept betting on himself, making a shitload of money.
*  Kept betting on himself, making this shit.
*  But he never asked the team to commit long term.
*  So there was still some type of flexibility that other teams didn't have.
*  So he was odd in that way.
*  But you never thought that you could put a team around him that was going to win a championship.
*  And they, and I don't think anything's changed now, you know?
*  So to sum up the Falcons off season, they decided not to hire Bill Belichick.
*  They kept their hole in their circle in place that had done all the other stuff.
*  They tampered with Kurt Cousins and are probably going to get penalized with some sort of something
*  at some point down the road when they get more info.
*  And then after tampering with Kurt Cousins and paying for him,
*  even though they don't know if he's going to be healthy for the start of the season,
*  then they spend the eighth pick on Michael Pennant.
*  They drafted his successor.
*  The only thing I actually think for he Morris, I actually liked that coaching.
*  I would have been way more fun if they had hired like the guy Carolina hired
*  like Dave Canales, like, oh man, you didn't hire belt.
*  But I actually do think for he Morris could be a good coach.
*  But at the same time, they passed on Bill Belichick, the greatest coach of all time.
