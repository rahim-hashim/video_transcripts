# NFL MVP Still Up For Grabs? Plus Bad NFL Owners and Surprise Coaches | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [December 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds)
*  Peter Strager is in our New York Spotify Ringer studios looking super snazzy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=0.0s)]
*  It just fits. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=6.84s)]
*  It's the most professional we've felt in a while. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=7.92s)]
*  Really weird stretch of the schedule right now. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=9.68s)]
*  We have two Saturday games with teams that are also all going to be playing on Wednesday. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=11.88s)]
*  Do you think the league will ever do anything like this again? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=17.32s)]
*  Is this a one-time thing? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=19.72s)]
*  I think they're hoping to do this every year. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  It's unprecedented in how it all worked out, Bill. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=22.92s)]
*  So when they first thought of this Christmas Day extravaganza, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=25.32s)]
*  they were like, we'll have two games and we'll give it to a high bidder. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  Netflix got involved, obviously, and gave a lot of money. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=32.28s)]
*  And it was like, all right, we know we have a Wednesday game and they're going to be, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=35.32s)]
*  you know, premier teams because Netflix is paying top dollar. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=39.16s)]
*  But how do we account for player safety the best way we possibly can? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=42.0s)]
*  Like, well, you can't play Sunday than Wednesday. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=45.32s)]
*  Let's make it Saturday than Wednesday, which means now four of these teams in the AFC, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=48.32s)]
*  who just so happened to be four of the top seven teams, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=54.68s)]
*  are playing three games in 11 days in late December. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=58.04s)]
*  Unheard of. And the way it worked out, and we're recording this on Thursday, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=62.84s)]
*  and it doesn't matter who wins tonight. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=68.2s)]
*  But originally it was supposed to be Bengals versus Browns on Thursday night football. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=70.32s)]
*  And Amazon has the ability to ask to flex out. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=75.24s)]
*  And a month ago, they went to the league and said, can we flex out of Bengals-Browns? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=78.6s)]
*  That's a terrible game. Can we get out of that? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=82.2s)]
*  And the league said there's no game to really put there. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=83.72s)]
*  The only option would be Chargers-Brancos in L.A., but we can't do it because of league bylaws. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=86.56s)]
*  The Broncos have already played one road Thursday night game. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=93.64s)]
*  And one of the major rules was you will never play two Thursday night road games. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=96.84s)]
*  So they go to Sean Payton and they say, look, you're going to say no, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=101.32s)]
*  but we're going to present it to you. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=104.72s)]
*  And Payton was like, fuck it. Put us on Thursday night. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=106.0s)]
*  We want to be on primetime. We want to go into that building. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=108.6s)]
*  I want to play them on a Thursday night. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=111.52s)]
*  Now, the result of all that a month later is six of the top seven teams in the AFC [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=113.16s)]
*  are going to be playing two games on five days rest. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=119.92s)]
*  And three of the and four of the top six teams in the AFC [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=123.16s)]
*  are going to be playing three games on 11 days rest. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=128.16s)]
*  Meanwhile, there's a team up there in Western New York, the Buffalo Bills, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=130.6s)]
*  who play the Patriots on a Sunday, the Jets on a Sunday and the Patriots again on a Sunday. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=134.56s)]
*  And already looking at that playoff run. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=140.04s)]
*  Well, and then you have it works out for the Broncos because he's like, yeah, yeah, fuck it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=142.24s)]
*  Let's go. We'll go right in. And meanwhile, the charges are all banged up. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. So you're giving them three less days to to heal, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=150.24s)]
*  which I thought probably was an unintended consequence. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=154.16s)]
*  Yeah. Over and over again, it just seems like everything's working out great for the Bills. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=156.8s)]
*  This is I don't know how they pulled it off. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  But the KC, the whole Mahomes goes down. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=164.28s)]
*  Then Netflix is worried about their Wednesday game. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  But then Mahomes, I heard Raheem say this on the Ringer gambling show today, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=170.44s)]
*  where Mahomes is like LeBron, where he gets these injuries and it seems like he's going to be out for six weeks [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=174.12s)]
*  and then he's fine two days later. He's just one of those guys. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=179.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think he's going to play. I think he's going to play Saturday against Texans. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=181.68s)]
*  Like, you know why we know he's going to play because the line moves six points. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=184.24s)]
*  Did it really? All right. Yeah. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=187.4s)]
*  That's been the word out of that place all week that the one seed is very important to them. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  They're not going to fake it and say, well, Mahomes is safety. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=193.84s)]
*  Like they want that one seed and they want that week off. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=195.92s)]
*  And I've spoken to multiple sources in that building that, you know, if Pat says he can go, he's going to go. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=198.6s)]
*  He has earned that from from the coaching staff and they're not looking to protect him physically. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=204.56s)]
*  I remember a couple of years back in the divisional round against Trevor Lawrence, he bangs up the ankle. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=209.04s)]
*  Everyone's worried. What's he going to do? What's he going to do? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=213.76s)]
*  He he doesn't finish the game, but then he does play against the Bengals in the AFC Championship game [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=215.48s)]
*  and he runs for that first down and he just hobbled through it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=220.2s)]
*  But he got through it. I thought we might get a very Carson Wentz Christmas. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=223.24s)]
*  I think the NFL and Netflix would not have been thrilled. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=227.28s)]
*  I don't know if Beyonce and Mariah Carey and the rest would have enjoyed it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=229.52s)]
*  Burt Kreischer and Nate Bregazzi and the rest. I don't know. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=233.08s)]
*  But in this case, it looks like you're getting Mahomes and you're going to get all the the fixings with it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=236.04000000000002s)]
*  And it's going to be Chiefs versus Steelers with with Mahomes. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  And the stakes couldn't be higher because there's one other. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=244.32000000000002s)]
*  I think it matters. One other stake beyond the one seed and all that stuff. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=247.52s)]
*  It's Mahomes kind of lost his spot in line this season, you know, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=250.8s)]
*  and now he's turned into this. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=255.72s)]
*  Well, when the playoffs come, he's going to turn it on. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=257.44s)]
*  But I think from just from an entertainment standpoint and from. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=259.52s)]
*  Honestly, a ceiling standpoint, Alan and Lamar Jackson have just been better. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=264.96s)]
*  Even Burrows been more fun to watch and Mahomes is just grinding these games out. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=268.72s)]
*  It always looks like he has seven injuries and he's having one of those seasons [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=272.96000000000004s)]
*  you have when you're 37, but he's still in his 20s. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=277.08s)]
*  And he's he's played, you know, a lot more games than probably some other quarterbacks [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=281.16s)]
*  the last few years, and the weapons have been in and out. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=285.4s)]
*  He the tackle situation has been dicey. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=288.32s)]
*  I get it. But it's just interesting. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=291.64s)]
*  Like, I just think Alan and Lamar have have blown him out of the water [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=293.88s)]
*  during this regular season. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=297.59999999999997s)]
*  But you also feel like we're going to play off some. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=298.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's just probably going to yank it back. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=301.67999999999995s)]
*  And I think that's why the number one seed is so important. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=303.76s)]
*  Give us an advantage. Give us something over these teams. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=306.0s)]
*  Remember, the Bills beat them head to head. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=308.47999999999996s)]
*  So if they were to lose, you know, two of the next three games, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=309.84s)]
*  then they succumb and they have to go on the road and they don't want to do that. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=314.24s)]
*  They want the one seed. They want the week off. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=317.16s)]
*  They think it's important. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=319.08s)]
*  The offensive line has been a disaster. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=320.24s)]
*  And they put D.J. Humphries in there for one game. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=321.96s)]
*  He lasted one game. And then Joe Tooney, a guard, is playing left tackle [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=323.88s)]
*  for a team that's the one seed in 13 and one. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=327.52s)]
*  It's it's pretty incredible. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=329.4s)]
*  And, you know, the numbers weren't crazy sack wise, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=331.48s)]
*  but he was under pressure the entire game last week against Cleveland. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=334.32s)]
*  And you look at what Houston's bringing this weekend. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=337.0s)]
*  And between Daniel Hunter and Will Anderson, they have the second most sacks [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=339.56s)]
*  in the NFL. That's in Christmas. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=343.4s)]
*  You know, you have this one on Saturday. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  Then on Christmas, you think T.J. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=347.91999999999996s)]
*  Watts going to play, you assume Kam Heyward and all those guys are out there. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=349.32s)]
*  Like he's going up against two of the best defensive front sevens [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=352.59999999999997s)]
*  in the league over the next two weeks. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=354.56s)]
*  If they win both of those games, though, they get a bye [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=356.2s)]
*  and they can rest week 18 and the next week during the wild card round. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=358.84s)]
*  So I was I did a thing on Sunday with Sal about [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=362.79999999999995s)]
*  the year Allen's having and how actually it's a bad sign for both [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=367.28s)]
*  Super Bowl hopes when you have these teams with the awesome quarterback [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=371.08000000000004s)]
*  having the MVP year combined with a defense that can't really stop anybody. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=375.16s)]
*  The signs are bad. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=380.0s)]
*  Like you went through the list. I heard. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=381.76s)]
*  Yeah, I think just in general. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=383.08000000000004s)]
*  But then this this week, Aaron Schatz had a tweet. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=384.64000000000004s)]
*  What's he got about? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=388.16s)]
*  Basically, in the last 30 years, 11 teams went nine and five [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=390.8s)]
*  and then made the Super Bowl. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=394.88s)]
*  And the reason he did it was because for DVOA, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=396.76s)]
*  which has been an essential part of kind of studying falling football [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=399.48s)]
*  most of the century, the Ravens are nine and five. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=403.48s)]
*  They're shoved aside a little bit right now, I think, especially as Buffalo's [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=407.0s)]
*  got nothing, but 11 out of 30 teams have made the Super Bowl and some good teams [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=410.96000000000004s)]
*  like 2016 Atlanta was nine and five. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=415.36s)]
*  The 2002 Raiders, you know, on down the line, 2023 Casey last year. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=418.16s)]
*  And I don't know the fact that they're number one in DVOA [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=423.48s)]
*  and not being talked about. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=427.76s)]
*  They have this Pittsburgh game coming up this weekend. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=429.08s)]
*  There's six and a half point favorites against Tomlin and the Steelers [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=432.52s)]
*  when Lamar has struggled against them, you know, for his whole career, basically. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=435.8s)]
*  But I do wonder if they're starting to get a little sleepy. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=439.68s)]
*  Like I was looking at their their title odds, their AFC odds, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=442.52s)]
*  and maybe they're the undervalued team because everyone's on Green Day now [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=446.64s)]
*  in the AFC. That was I was a week late on that one. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=450.08s)]
*  Maybe it's Baltimore and the AFC. What are your Baltimore thoughts? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=452.68s)]
*  I love Baltimore this year. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=455.44s)]
*  I think they got the perfect bye week. They needed it more than ever. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=456.6s)]
*  They got it. They come out. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=459.36s)]
*  They beat up on the Giants last week where Lamar throws five touchdowns. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=460.24s)]
*  And now they're getting healthy. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=463.92s)]
*  And it's look, the eight of nine, it's real. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=465.08000000000004s)]
*  And, you know, the last Ravens quarterback to beat the Steelers was Snoop Huntley. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=468.52000000000004s)]
*  And a lot of those games. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=472.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And a lot of those games were were decided by one score less. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=474.92s)]
*  And the Steelers just found a way at the end, even the last time they played. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=478.40000000000003s)]
*  You remember that Peyton Wilson interception on the sideline with Justice Hill? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=481.44s)]
*  They still had a chance at the end with the two point conversion, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=485.2s)]
*  but there was so much confusion. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=487.44s)]
*  Lamar afterwards is furious on the sideline. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=488.91999999999996s)]
*  And it's like, all right, well, if you can't beat them in close games, like, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=491.32s)]
*  how do we have our faith in the Ravens? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=495.4s)]
*  I think since that game, they have gotten healthier. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=497.64s)]
*  And I think the bye week was important. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=500.67999999999995s)]
*  What I think is going to be very interesting on Sunday, which, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=502.12s)]
*  I mean, you're talking about the greatest sports viewing day. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=505.55999999999995s)]
*  If you're a football fan ever, is this is this Saturday? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=508.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's right there, smack dab in the middle. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=511.59999999999997s)]
*  430 Eastern. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=513.68s)]
*  You got Brady and Burkhardt on the call. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=515.0799999999999s)]
*  Justin Tucker is going to have to make a kick here. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=517.4399999999999s)]
*  And Justin Tucker is going to have to come through. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=519.8s)]
*  And last week he made one and they had a lot of field goals [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=522.0s)]
*  and a lot of touchdowns and it was fine. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=524.64s)]
*  But like Justin Tucker is going to have to make a kick or two [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=526.4799999999999s)]
*  in some inclement weather against the Steelers. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=528.52s)]
*  And I think it's important that Justin Tucker gets right, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=531.2399999999999s)]
*  because that's how they play football, and especially against the Steelers team. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=533.28s)]
*  It's always a one score game. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=535.92s)]
*  Going against the guy who now has the Justin Tucker championship. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=537.3199999999999s)]
*  He's got the belt. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=541.68s)]
*  Chris Boswell headed for 200 fantasy points. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=542.32s)]
*  Yeah. So Baltimore's first in offense, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=546.0400000000001s)]
*  Pittsburgh's seventh in defense for DVOA. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=549.7600000000001s)]
*  And yet Pittsburgh got their asses kicked by Philly last week. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=552.32s)]
*  And I thought it was a more alarming game than usual loss, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=555.1600000000001s)]
*  because they lost in ways that I wasn't. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=558.88s)]
*  I just weren't on my bingo card like them just getting manhandled, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=562.0400000000001s)]
*  them giving up a 22 play drive to basically finish the game. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=565.5600000000001s)]
*  But if you're a Steelers fan, you look at it and you go, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=569.08s)]
*  well, we got screwed on that penalty where there was clear video after of the guy, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=572.32s)]
*  Daris punching our guy. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=575.7600000000001s)]
*  Darnell Washington, yeah. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=577.2800000000001s)]
*  And then they're driving down. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=578.32s)]
*  It seems like they're going to maybe tie the game and Najee fumbles. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=580.2800000000001s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, a little closer than you thought. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=583.08s)]
*  I thought they got pushed around and manhandled and beaten up. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=586.5600000000001s)]
*  And now they're heading into these next two games. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=589.36s)]
*  Saturday, Wednesday. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=591.8000000000001s)]
*  This just feels like this all flipped at the worst possible time. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=592.84s)]
*  What are your Pittsburgh feelings? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=596.48s)]
*  I think your instincts are right that they have dominated in the trenches [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=598.1600000000001s)]
*  and Russell has not made mistakes. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=601.12s)]
*  And like in this game, Cooper Dejean has the fumble. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=602.5600000000001s)]
*  Hertz makes the early mistake. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=605.2s)]
*  You're like, OK, here come the Steelers. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=606.4s)]
*  And then they just couldn't close that gap. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=607.72s)]
*  And then, like you said, in real time, it felt like two hours at the end of the game. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=609.68s)]
*  It was just and like it was such a long drive that like Brady and Burkhardt [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=613.2s)]
*  are doing banter about Belichick during it. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=617.0s)]
*  Right. Like they're talking college. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=618.72s)]
*  Yeah, you snuck in like empty the bag. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=620.88s)]
*  We have to find something to talk about because this game is in hand right now. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=623.48s)]
*  That's worrisome if you're the Steelers, because their whole mantra has been [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=627.32s)]
*  keep the game close. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=630.64s)]
*  Russell will make a play at the end and will run the ball down your throats [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=631.72s)]
*  and will stop you on defense. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=634.72s)]
*  And they couldn't do that against a more physical team in Philadelphia. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=635.96s)]
*  But there is a mental edge here. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=639.08s)]
*  Like Tomlin's coming into this thing. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=640.32s)]
*  Like we've won eight of nine with we've won games with everyone [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=641.64s)]
*  from Duck Hodges to Mason Rudolph to whoever. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=645.04s)]
*  Like we can beat the Ravens. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=647.48s)]
*  We have no fear going into this building. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=648.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, part of me wonders. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=652.12s)]
*  And I've been right to them the whole time. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=654.36s)]
*  Part of me wonders if they outkick their coverage a little bit this season, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=656.04s)]
*  just in general, you look back at some of the games they won, some of the schedule stuff. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=659.52s)]
*  Their most impressive win was probably that first Baltimore game just for. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=663.88s)]
*  Yeah. Really pulling it out and see me. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=667.28s)]
*  But that it just shouldn't matter this much that George Pickens is hurt. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=669.0s)]
*  I like George Pickens. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=673.04s)]
*  He's their biggest threat, though. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=674.1999999999999s)]
*  I know. But it just it shouldn't be just an absolute deal breaker to be able to, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=675.68s)]
*  you know, because then they're running the ball all the time, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=679.8s)]
*  but they're running it for three yards of carry because everyone [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=681.92s)]
*  to their point knows they have to run the ball. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=684.76s)]
*  Let me. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=687.08s)]
*  Because my thought is, like, I wonder if this is. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=688.1600000000001s)]
*  A Lamar. Oh, I can't be. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=691.4s)]
*  No doubt. Here we go. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=694.52s)]
*  And he had great. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=696.84s)]
*  It loses again. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=697.96s)]
*  And it's like, holy shit, Pittsburgh's in a test. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=699.48s)]
*  I'm trying to think of whatever narrative comes out of that game. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=701.64s)]
*  And that feels like a likely narrative to me. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=703.72s)]
*  And then it's a quick turnaround because four days later, Lamar's got to go play the Texans. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=706.0s)]
*  It's like this crazy round robin. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=710.12s)]
*  But Kyle Brant and I on Good Morning Football, we always, you know, talk about the [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=711.44s)]
*  most valuable player industrial industry complex like we've been this thing [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=716.36s)]
*  like starting in week two. It's like, who's the MVP? Who's the MVP? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=720.64s)]
*  And I put it to bed last week, maybe a little premature. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=723.64s)]
*  And I was like, Josh Allen's done. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=726.1600000000001s)]
*  Like, it's over. Like, why are we even let's not just do this for the sake of a segment. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=728.6s)]
*  And the amount of feedback I got from people around the league, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=732.24s)]
*  not fans of being like, slow down. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=735.4000000000001s)]
*  Lamar's got better numbers and Lamar's games are all showcase [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=738.2s)]
*  games over the next few weeks. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=742.12s)]
*  So on Saturday, when everyone's watching, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=744.16s)]
*  Lamar's going to be able to have that showcase game. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=747.72s)]
*  And then on Wednesday, on Christmas, when everybody's watching Christmas afternoon, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=749.6s)]
*  Lamar can have that showcase game. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=753.32s)]
*  And by the end of it, we're not going to see Josh Allen on national television [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=755.04s)]
*  for the last month of the season. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=758.5600000000001s)]
*  And you might say, well, who gives a shit about national TV? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=760.28s)]
*  The people who vote are writers who are usually in press boxes [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=762.84s)]
*  and just looking at box scores afterwards. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=766.16s)]
*  But on Christmas Day and on a Saturday, they will be watching. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=767.76s)]
*  And if enough hysteria gets going and Lamar can finish this thing out, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=771.36s)]
*  it is not over yet. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=775.16s)]
*  Lamar could steal this and get his third MVP. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=776.24s)]
*  On Fandl right now, Allen's nine to one. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=778.64s)]
*  Basically, he's a nine to one favorite. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=780.84s)]
*  And Lamar is plus 650. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=783.36s)]
*  And that feels out of whack to me because Lamar having an awesome game against Pittsburgh. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=784.88s)]
*  And then what you said, everything else he's doing is going to be like major games. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=790.24s)]
*  Josh is going to be on like my top right multi view for the Pats [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=794.12s)]
*  Bills game. And that's about it. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=799.36s)]
*  Like he's just going to be in witness protection. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=800.92s)]
*  With that, with all that said, there is another scenario where the Mars [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=804.04s)]
*  sucks against the against Pittsburgh again. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=807.68s)]
*  And Pittsburgh wins 18 to 16 and Justin Tucker misses a couple field goals. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=809.7199999999999s)]
*  The whole thing. Speaking of awards, I wanted to ask you this. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=814.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I hate when people do interviews and they say I wanted to ask you this. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=817.28s)]
*  I should just ask you. My bad. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=821.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm still trying to get better at this. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=822.76s)]
*  Forgive me. Now you'll get there. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=824.1999999999999s)]
*  Coach of the year. Oh. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=825.7199999999999s)]
*  Do you know the favorite is? Have you looked at this? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=827.72s)]
*  I haven't. I would imagine I'm going to give it to you. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=831.08s)]
*  Twelve and two Kevin O'Connell is probably the favorite right now. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=833.36s)]
*  So he is. He's the only one with minus odds. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=836.0s)]
*  He's minus 190. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=838.4s)]
*  Dan Campbell dropped a little bit because his entire team got hurt. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=839.76s)]
*  Apparently, it was his fault. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=842.6800000000001s)]
*  But but hell of a locker room speech at an interview in ninety seven one in Detroit. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=844.0s)]
*  I guess the pregame speeches only go so far. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=847.64s)]
*  Sean Payton, six to one. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=849.5600000000001s)]
*  Dan Quinn, ten to one. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=851.48s)]
*  Tomlin, fifteen to one. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=852.72s)]
*  McDermott, thirty to one. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=854.1600000000001s)]
*  And then you have to press the see rest of the bets link [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=856.3199999999999s)]
*  to go unfunded to go to Sean McDermott, thirty to one. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=860.56s)]
*  Sirianni, Bulls. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=863.92s)]
*  Where's Andy Reid? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=865.68s)]
*  There's Andy Reid at thirty five to one. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=866.64s)]
*  So thirteen and one. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=869.6s)]
*  Is this like a Belichick thing? He's not allowed to win. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=870.76s)]
*  He's done. He's three wins away from three hundred wins in his career. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=873.16s)]
*  And no one has even mentioned that they're thirteen and one. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=876.0799999999999s)]
*  All they do is. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=878.8s)]
*  I would say not the number two guy to be able to bet. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=879.6s)]
*  I just don't understand that. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=882.92s)]
*  He succumbed any any respect for any of that. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=883.9599999999999s)]
*  And then we'll see him and Jane. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=886.12s)]
*  Like it is it is it is amazing how this award is given out. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=887.28s)]
*  Usually it's a first year guy who gets his team into the playoffs [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=891.44s)]
*  and it's like a quick bump. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=894.16s)]
*  And we've seen that from McVeigh and from Matt Nagy and from Stefanski. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=895.08s)]
*  It could have been Harbaugh this year. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=898.88s)]
*  They could have been 11 and five or 11 six. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=900.24s)]
*  Brian Dable was that this year. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=902.8s)]
*  I think the O'Connell thing is happening because people are just like [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=904.76s)]
*  they keep on winning. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=907.84s)]
*  And if you look at their team, it's a bunch of castaways, whether it be [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=908.64s)]
*  Darnold, Aaron Jones, Jonathan Grenard, like you go right down the list. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=912.4s)]
*  It's all guys who are with other teams last year. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=916.56s)]
*  But let's not let's not underestimate just what Andy Reid is doing. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=918.28s)]
*  Their roster every week. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=922.88s)]
*  We are underestimating it because it's the 10th best odds on Fandle right now. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=924.44s)]
*  And apparently nobody's betting on them. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=929.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I don't get it. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=930.92s)]
*  Amazing. We're going to go through the coaching hires and Spags [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=932.76s)]
*  is not going to get a single look again. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=935.68s)]
*  I'm just telling you like it is. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=937.08s)]
*  No one's going to interview Matt Nagy and their GM is going to remain. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=938.08s)]
*  And the number two GM is Mike Borghansi. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=941.4s)]
*  I think he's excellent. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=943.64s)]
*  I don't even know if he's going to get one of these GM jobs. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=945.0799999999999s)]
*  So it's going to be like, all right, they do it again. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=947.12s)]
*  And they're just going to bring everyone back next year. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=949.24s)]
*  It's this fine, well-oiled machine and they don't get poached. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=950.8s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=953.36s)]
*  You think like all the weapons they lost, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=954.3199999999999s)]
*  the fact that they had they had the bullseye on them all year, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=958.0s)]
*  all the close games they played that they had to pull out. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=961.16s)]
*  I think he would be my number two choice. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=964.56s)]
*  I actually think what O'Connell's been doing on Minnesota, that team is so well [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=966.36s)]
*  coached, so well prepared, salvaging Darnold and turning him into a guy [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=969.88s)]
*  that's now probably a 30 to 35 million dollar a year guy in the open market. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=974.04s)]
*  He's made it a real a real decision for them. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=978.56s)]
*  And I would also say, you know, I work on the Sunday kickoff show on Fox [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=981.2s)]
*  and like early on in the season, Michael Vick, my colleague, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=985.92s)]
*  who's now the new head coach of Norfolk State. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=988.2s)]
*  Shout out to Norfolk State. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=990.12s)]
*  Michael Vick was like, you know, Darnold's kind of like a game manager. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=991.4399999999999s)]
*  And then he goes on this run where he threw five touchdowns in a game. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=994.08s)]
*  He had to take them 90 yards outside in Chicago in overtime. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=998.2800000000001s)]
*  Did that. Yeah. He also said a few fourth quarter. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1002.48s)]
*  Like they need the drive. He's come through. Yeah. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1006.72s)]
*  That's not game manager. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1009.44s)]
*  That is OK. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1010.8000000000001s)]
*  We're going to put the ball in Sam's hands and like let's let him lead us the way. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1012.08s)]
*  Interesting one this weekend in Seattle. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1015.88s)]
*  I would think they would win. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1017.88s)]
*  And then they finish up the season with the Lions and the Packers. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1019.32s)]
*  And that's where it's at. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1021.5600000000001s)]
*  It's like, all right, everyone's waiting for that. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1022.4000000000001s)]
*  And those are the two games to end the season. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1024.0800000000002s)]
*  But if the Vikings went out, Bill, they are the number one seed in the NFC. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1025.56s)]
*  And that's incredible. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1029.32s)]
*  If the Vikings went out, regardless of what happens to anybody else. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1031.0s)]
*  Yeah, they are the one seed. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1034.84s)]
*  They would have all the tiebreakers. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1036.12s)]
*  I mean, Detroit probably needs that one seed more than any team [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1039.6s)]
*  has needed a one seed in a while. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1042.76s)]
*  I don't know how much it's going to help. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1044.6799999999998s)]
*  Right now. I don't know, man. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1046.04s)]
*  Would you say that somebody had the graphic of all the people on IR by each team? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1048.1599999999999s)]
*  Detroit had 22 guys. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1053.52s)]
*  I have it here. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1056.1599999999999s)]
*  Detroit. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1056.76s)]
*  Detroit had 22. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1058.2s)]
*  Then the next team was the Browns at 18. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1060.44s)]
*  Yeah. And the Dolphins and Giants at 15. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1064.96s)]
*  So the Lions had basically, if you go to like the fifth most IR team, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1068.2s)]
*  they have almost, you know, 60 percent more than like the fourth place. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1072.32s)]
*  I've never seen anything like it. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1076.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't even know. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1078.1599999999999s)]
*  Do like I know you have some Lions connections. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1079.08s)]
*  Do they even have an explanation for how they can have this many injuries? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1081.6s)]
*  No, it's it's it's it's it's like, do you look at the training staff and go, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1084.84s)]
*  what are we are we doing something wrong? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1089.08s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1090.52s)]
*  I you know, I remember the 20, 20 Niners had something like this [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1091.32s)]
*  where like just early on in the season, it was like Bosa's out and then Garoppolo's out. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1094.24s)]
*  And like, but the crazy thing is, they're still finding ways to put up points. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1098.12s)]
*  Now, the David Montgomery loss is real. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1101.6799999999998s)]
*  That one sucks. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1103.9199999999998s)]
*  Like Montgomery's very important to them. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1105.0s)]
*  That was when I closed the door on my Lions one seed bet. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1107.24s)]
*  It might be it might be done the Buffalo where they just outscore everybody. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1110.68s)]
*  But now, but what really made them special was that Montgomery Gibbs combo. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1114.16s)]
*  I know it was a top three running back situation anyone had. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1118.4s)]
*  Now they don't have it. I know. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1121.76s)]
*  And we had you're going to love this. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1123.16s)]
*  We had Taylor Lautner on our show. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1126.96s)]
*  Good Morning Football, Taylor Lautner of Twilight Saga, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1129.64s)]
*  who, by the way, is a great dude and loves the NFL. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1132.4s)]
*  He has a podcast with his wife who appropriately is also named Taylor. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1135.52s)]
*  And they had Aiden Hutchinson on as their guest because he's a diehard Lions fan. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1138.96s)]
*  And we're promoting it. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1142.3600000000001s)]
*  And like Hutchinson's like, if we make the Super Bowl, I'm back. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1143.48s)]
*  If we make Super Bowl, we're back. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1146.28s)]
*  And that came out the same exact day as Dan Campbell's riveting radio interview. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1147.48s)]
*  And it's like on paper, it makes no sense that this team that is down 22 guys, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1152.44s)]
*  most of them on defense and are using third and fourth and fifth string players [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1157.64s)]
*  in key positions down the stretch should compete. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1161.4s)]
*  And then you talk to anyone there and it's like, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1163.92s)]
*  why can't we just be one of these teams of destiny? [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1166.6000000000001s)]
*  Why can't we be one of these magical teams? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1168.6s)]
*  And who knows if you get to the Super Bowl somehow, you get Aiden Hutchinson back [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1170.6399999999999s)]
*  and suddenly you find yourself in New Orleans and you got a bunch of crazy [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1175.04s)]
*  Lions fans who haven't seen a world championship game since 57. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1178.28s)]
*  The Pats had a year like that where [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1182.6799999999998s)]
*  like Troy Brown was playing Nickelback and just it just felt like everything [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1185.56s)]
*  was going wrong the whole year and they still almost made the Super Bowl. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1189.36s)]
*  But they had the Brady Belichick infrastructure. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1191.76s)]
*  It's a little different. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1194.3999999999999s)]
*  Jared Goff has never won a Super Bowl and Campbell's, you know. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1195.84s)]
*  Yeah. But we've seen like teams, the Colts had years where [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1199.76s)]
*  it just felt like their defense had passed the point of no return. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1203.84s)]
*  And they were somehow in the AFC title game. Yeah. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1206.56s)]
*  And that one rule them out. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1209.12s)]
*  But I got to say, the Montgomery thing, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1210.24s)]
*  that was the one that made me go up. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1213.3999999999999s)]
*  It's a defense sucked anyway. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1215.48s)]
*  Like they were going to have to win like Buffalo's going to have to win [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1216.84s)]
*  that Colts team. I think it was the 06 Colts team that won the Super Bowl. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1219.9199999999998s)]
*  They had the worst defense in the league and they'd given up like [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1222.88s)]
*  250 yards to Ron Dane and Dominic Davis and the Houston Texans, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1226.5200000000002s)]
*  like the last week of the season and then playoffs come and it's like, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1231.2s)]
*  we need to win three games. Can we string it together? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1233.8000000000002s)]
*  And they did. And the home field always, always matters when you can get it. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1236.16s)]
*  So if Detroit can find a way to just hold serve and maintain home field, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1240.2800000000002s)]
*  if they went out, they're the number one seed. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1244.1200000000001s)]
*  So you know, it's been lost, though. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1245.92s)]
*  I think if they're healthy, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1250.16s)]
*  I really do think they win the Super Bowl and they're the best team. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1251.6399999999999s)]
*  I think starting the year for what whatever their talent was in this [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1255.3999999999999s)]
*  situation and the guys at the points of the careers they're at, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1258.6799999999998s)]
*  I think they had the best team. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1261.56s)]
*  And I think that's why it feels so wide open now, because sometimes you just [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1263.6s)]
*  remember there was that year that the year Brady got hurt, 08. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1267.84s)]
*  Yeah. When all of a sudden we just ended up at that weird Pittsburgh, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1271.1599999999999s)]
*  Arizona Super Bowl. It's like, what the fuck is this? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1274.76s)]
*  Arizona, Arizona came in with eight wins on the regular season. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1277.44s)]
*  Yeah. Don't you feel like something weird like that could happen this year? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1280.36s)]
*  I'm prepared for like any Super Bowl matchup, right? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1284.1599999999999s)]
*  The NFC to me is so interesting. The AFC, you've got your powers and like, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1286.6799999999998s)]
*  they're all NFC. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1290.7199999999998s)]
*  Like, would you be shocked if Baker Mayfield and the Buccaneers upset, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1292.12s)]
*  you know, a team in the wild? And they beat the Vikings at home. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1296.4399999999998s)]
*  They just scored 37 on the road against the other. Of course. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1299.9199999999998s)]
*  They scored 40 points on the number one defense, the Chargers, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1303.36s)]
*  and put up 500 yards of offense. It didn't punt. And you're like, oh wait, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1306.1999999999998s)]
*  what the hell's going on in Tampa? Like they, they might be the team. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1309.64s)]
*  So this could be that year and the NFC, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1312.64s)]
*  like the Eagles could finish with 13 straight wins. And yet, I don't know. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1315.0800000000002s)]
*  Like, does that feel like the Eagles are going to run away with the NFC? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1319.88s)]
*  I don't feel that way. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1322.6000000000001s)]
*  I think the Vikings and the Packers can give them a battle in the Lions too. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1323.44s)]
*  So I'm excited this year's playoffs. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1326.0s)]
*  If you're just saying talent now for who's left, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1328.76s)]
*  it seems like the Eagles have the most talent in either conference, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1332.0400000000002s)]
*  just all sides of the ball. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1335.0400000000002s)]
*  If you're just going to do ranking of you're grading all the players. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1336.4399999999998s)]
*  And yet I don't even think the Eagles fans, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1340.32s)]
*  even the Eagles fans have like their guard up with it. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1343.08s)]
*  And there's always seems to be some weird stories popping out and chemistry [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1345.36s)]
*  stuff. And so part of me wonders, is that a red herring? [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1349.6799999999998s)]
*  And then the other part of me wonders, like, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1355.6799999999998s)]
*  every time there's smoke like that, it never turns out well for the team. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1357.76s)]
*  So I don't know what to think of them either. They, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1361.04s)]
*  they would have to be the team that if gone through your head, you would pick, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1362.84s)]
*  but I don't feel good about it. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1365.84s)]
*  That 2017 Eagles team, they lose went. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1367.6799999999998s)]
*  And I was the sideline reporter for Giants Eagles and like Spagnolo was the [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1370.32s)]
*  quarterback and the coach of the Giants as an interim coach. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1374.24s)]
*  And everyone was off the Eagles at that point. And then Foles comes in. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1377.52s)]
*  And I remember talking to Foles and Peterson and Brandon Graham and all those [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1380.9199999999998s)]
*  guys. And this is right before the dog masks. And it was like, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1384.76s)]
*  the world is against us. They don't believe in us. We're the underdogs. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1387.8799999999999s)]
*  And like that really, that really worked. Can you still do it again? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1390.9199999999998s)]
*  And now the thing is, you know, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1395.0s)]
*  Jaylen Hertz throws for a couple of hundred yards to two receivers and then [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1396.88s)]
*  comes up and it's like, is that what you all wanted? And it's like, no, no, no, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1400.8000000000002s)]
*  no, we didn't do this. The media didn't do this. Brandon Graham, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1403.44s)]
*  your teammate went out on a radio interview and said that you guys weren't [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1406.3200000000002s)]
*  friends. Like we didn't do this. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1409.04s)]
*  And then Sirianni and Clint hurt are having this really like heated thing on the [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1410.6000000000001s)]
*  sidelines where Jaylen Carter is laughing in the, and it's like, no, no guys, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1415.04s)]
*  that the cameras caught that. Like that happened. That was real. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1419.0s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, the media is trying to pull us apart. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1421.2s)]
*  So they find a way to galvanize there in Philly and I'm sure she'll and whoever [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1423.44s)]
*  else you have on the Philly special can break it down far greater than I can, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1428.1200000000001s)]
*  but like they feed off that tension, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1431.1200000000001s)]
*  but there isn't a lot of joy in the Philly fan. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1433.3200000000002s)]
*  Like that's what's the noticeable thing. It's always like tense and stressed. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1436.1200000000001s)]
*  And it's like, it's not, it's not this fun ride. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1440.48s)]
*  Yeah. Even watching the Eagles, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1442.76s)]
*  it doesn't seem like a team that's having like the most unbelievable time ever [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1444.24s)]
*  together. And I don't know. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1448.04s)]
*  You notice different vibes from different teams. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1450.44s)]
*  Maybe though, maybe it'll come together. I wouldn't rule it out, but, um, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1453.2s)]
*  you did make me think of something. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1456.72s)]
*  And maybe it's like two weeks to really, to figure this out, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1459.56s)]
*  but who's the best candidate for the nobody believes in us team in the playoffs? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1462.56s)]
*  Cause that Eagles team is a great example of that 2017, whence goes down, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1467.04s)]
*  everyone writes them off. Oh, they're done. And then they, it's, it's the, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1471.1200000000001s)]
*  it's the force that has been kind of the most dominant playoff force year after [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1475.96s)]
*  year after year. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1480.48s)]
*  Is it Detroit? Does the have the best nobody believes in us case? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1482.28s)]
*  Cause we don't even believe in them anymore. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1486.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think everyone's fleeing that bandwagon and Dan Campbell's the [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1488.76s)]
*  perfectly nobody, perfect. Nobody believes in us coach. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1491.12s)]
*  And like Chris Spielman's in that building. He's the perfect. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1494.0s)]
*  Nobody believes in us guy. I, I feel like they'll feed off that. And, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1496.6399999999999s)]
*  and that is your team. And then I think if there's another one of them, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1500.72s)]
*  like the other one that you would say is a Houston Texans who are going to [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1504.08s)]
*  easily win their division, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1506.9199999999998s)]
*  they're going to play the chiefs and the Ravens over the next two weeks. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1508.08s)]
*  And they might, they might win two of those games, one of those games, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1511.3999999999999s)]
*  and no one's going to pick them. And everyone's going to say, Oh, whatever. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1514.0s)]
*  The thing with them is they're the, no, no, fuck you. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1516.76s)]
*  Nobody should believe in you guys. You guys are barely winning. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1518.8799999999999s)]
*  I saw you lose to the Jets on a Thursday night in person. No, it's your fault. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1523.44s)]
*  You can't even score 20 points. You can't block. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1526.76s)]
*  I would say Casey last year was a good example of this, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1529.6s)]
*  but they lost that Raiders game. If you were like, I'm out, I'm out. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1532.08s)]
*  They're not going to do it again. It's done. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1534.92s)]
*  Aiden O'Connell beat them. I'm out. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1536.36s)]
*  And, and, and I thought they used that to their advantage. Yeah. The, uh, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1538.2399999999998s)]
*  the Vikings are, the Vikings are a candidate, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1542.8799999999999s)]
*  but like O'Connell doesn't have that like deal with him. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1544.6799999999998s)]
*  Like I feel like you need a coach who's going to really dig deep. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1547.1999999999998s)]
*  Sirianni does that. Dan Campbell does that. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1550.2399999999998s)]
*  Like I've heard stories of Sirianni like going really deep with film references [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1553.1999999999998s)]
*  and like showing movie clips. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1557.2399999999998s)]
*  And I remember Dan Quinn when he was back with Atlanta would call me on a [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1558.7199999999998s)]
*  Saturday night just to bullshit before my Fox show. And I'd be like, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1561.8799999999999s)]
*  give me something. And he's like, well, I show it. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1564.52s)]
*  I showed a sugar Shane Moseley fight last night because the situation was this. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1566.8s)]
*  And I'm like, dude, like, like these guys, they go deep. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1570.8s)]
*  Like what can motivate these put in like that's Campbell, that's Sirianni. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1573.1200000000001s)]
*  Kevin O'Connell's more like guys, we got this. We can do this one game at a time. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1577.56s)]
*  Like there's none of that hate and none of that toxicity of like us against the [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1581.64s)]
*  world. It's more, I believe in you. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1585.92s)]
*  Yeah. Cause I think Pittsburgh is maybe. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1590.32s)]
*  Enter the waiting room for this combo, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1594.1999999999998s)]
*  especially if they like lost to Baltimore this week. All right, we're done. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1596.0s)]
*  They're out. Fun run. I can't believe you won 10 games. You guys are out. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1599.12s)]
*  Watts hurt now. And, and then Tomlin feeds off that. But yeah, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1603.52s)]
*  I would say Detroit has to be the odds on favorite for it. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1607.8s)]
*  Maybe Tampa too with just not being considered at all. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1610.36s)]
*  And Tampa's had some good wins. Their offense is excellent. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1614.6799999999998s)]
*  Like they're over 400 points already, you know, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1618.52s)]
*  dropped 40 in the chargers. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1621.24s)]
*  You think about it too. They, they lost their offensive coordinator from a year ago. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1623.04s)]
*  He took the job in Carolina. Then Liam Cohen comes in and Liam's put up better [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1626.64s)]
*  numbers with Baker, which is incredible. And what's fun with this team is they [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1630.36s)]
*  lost four games in a row. Mike Evans was her, Chris Godwin was her, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1634.52s)]
*  and everyone wrote them off, but they just went ahead and just kept on winning. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1638.0s)]
*  So now they're the hot team. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1641.28s)]
*  You know who didn't write them off? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1642.36s)]
*  Me and Sal because they were in the such a bad division. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1643.24s)]
*  Nobody is allowed to be even Carolina. You could barely write off. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1646.04s)]
*  Is seven wins going to be our champ in this division? [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1649.84s)]
*  What do you need in that NFC, AFC South 30? You need less than 30 wins? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1651.8s)]
*  What was the combined bet you guys did? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1655.6s)]
*  Yeah, we're getting that. It was under 30. We're getting that. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1656.96s)]
*  The, the Pennex Cousins thing was coming for a while. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1660.72s)]
*  And I knew when they did that mile an hour stat for cousins, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1664.1599999999999s)]
*  it was 36 miles an hour was just, you could, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1667.2s)]
*  you could see it the way they called the game with the Raiders, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1669.8s)]
*  where they just weren't going to let them do anything. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1672.1599999999999s)]
*  Is there any way to spin this? Like if, like, let's say, I'm Arthur blank. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1674.8799999999999s)]
*  How are you spinning this to me? That is it? Is it like, Hey, look, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1679.52s)]
*  this is why we had to invest in Pennex. Like these are assets. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1683.68s)]
*  If you go one for two, it's a win. Like what, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1687.48s)]
*  what do you say to Arthur blank at this point? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1689.48s)]
*  Well, I think the first pat on the back goes to quasi a Doful Mensa and [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1691.44s)]
*  Kevin O'Connell up in Minnesota, who had a franchise quarterback and said, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1696.28s)]
*  we're going to let them walk out the building, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1699.6s)]
*  something nobody does without a plan B. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1700.8s)]
*  We're going to go to the draft and we're going to pick up a free agent. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1703.0s)]
*  But I remember talking to Kevin. He's like, it's heartbreaking. We love, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1705.28s)]
*  we love him, but we, he's 36 years old coming off an Achilles injury. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1707.6000000000001s)]
*  Like we can't give him a hundred million dollars. The Falcons did. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1711.52s)]
*  And your argument for the Falcons is like, all right, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1715.3600000000001s)]
*  let's see what we get with with Cousins. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1717.6000000000001s)]
*  I give them a little bit of credit and that they eventually did pull the plug [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1719.1200000000001s)]
*  because this he's going to make $90 million guaranteed from the Atlanta [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1722.48s)]
*  Falcons for 14 weeks of football. And they're paying him that. And they're like, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1727.0s)]
*  we're not going to just play you because we're paying him that we're going to [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1730.72s)]
*  then go to the back. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1733.2s)]
*  Why didn't they do it before the Raiders game? Why not give Pennex that Raider game? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1734.04s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1736.88s)]
*  I reported it on Fox a couple of weeks ago, cause he would look, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1737.72s)]
*  he looked horrible Cousins for three straight weeks. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1740.0800000000002s)]
*  So like the second week of it, they were playing the Chargers at home. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1743.7600000000002s)]
*  And I reported, I'm like, Pennex didn't take any first, first, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1747.5200000000002s)]
*  you know, squad snaps this week. It was all scout team. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1752.2s)]
*  And they were just like, we're going with Cousins. We're riding this out. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1755.3200000000002s)]
*  It's almost too little too late. But this does open things up a little bit. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1757.8000000000002s)]
*  Like Zach Robinson's a good offensive coach. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1762.0800000000002s)]
*  I knew him when he was with McVeigh's staff in LA and he was the [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1764.1599999999999s)]
*  quarterback's coach and he does all sorts of cool, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1767.1999999999998s)]
*  like QB waggle outside the pocket stuff. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1769.6399999999999s)]
*  And I know how excited he was when they drafted Pennex cause he's like, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1772.32s)]
*  that's really cool. And down the line, when the time comes, like, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1775.1999999999998s)]
*  we'll do really neat stuff with him. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1777.6s)]
*  I think you're going to see an entirely different offense over the next three [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1779.52s)]
*  weeks and a lot of stuff with a quarterback that isn't a running quarterback by, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1781.96s)]
*  by like Lamar, but he can move. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1785.6399999999999s)]
*  Kirk Cousins cannot move. He cannot move laterally. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1789.4399999999998s)]
*  That game against the Raiders on Monday night. I mean, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1792.36s)]
*  he scored a touchdown early and it was like, pump your chest, like told you, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1794.6399999999999s)]
*  got no, like he couldn't move. It was a crazy game to watch. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1797.84s)]
*  And that was the fourth straight week he's done that. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1801.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird. Cause week one, he looked like that. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1803.6799999999998s)]
*  And then everybody took the Eagles in week two, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1806.7199999999998s)]
*  which is now looking back one of the weird results of the season when the [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1808.9599999999998s)]
*  game's over, somehow they don't. And then all of a sudden Atlanta has the bomb. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1811.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Atlanta comes flying back down the other way and it's like, Kurt's back. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1815.9199999999998s)]
*  And, uh, it turned out he wasn't back, but. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1819.88s)]
*  Look, we've seen teams get out of these giant awful cap hit things. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1823.4s)]
*  Russell Wilson, Denver, you know, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1826.8400000000001s)]
*  takes a huge hit with him and there's somehow going to be like a 10 win team [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1829.8s)]
*  this year. So it's not, it's not awful. I'm to me more interested. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1832.88s)]
*  Like this makes the season more fun now that we get Penex. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1836.76s)]
*  You suddenly get this new guy with all these weapons and it's like, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1839.76s)]
*  what if this guy's good? This could be like, cause you know, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1842.8400000000001s)]
*  I have a chance to maybe, maybe, uh, you know, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1846.24s)]
*  it's not a puncher's chance to maybe catch Tampa if Tampa has a dumb loss. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1849.44s)]
*  Can I break a little news here while I'm live on the podcast with you? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1853.44s)]
*  I just got a text that Jets have completed interviewing Jim Nagy, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1856.16s)]
*  who is the senior director of the senior bowl for their GM position. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1860.48s)]
*  So they're interviewing a lot of guys. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1864.96s)]
*  So I'm just interjecting with a text I got from a source. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1866.1200000000001s)]
*  Is that kind of breaking news or like half breaking news? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1868.92s)]
*  It's news. They interview the guy. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1871.2s)]
*  Let's take a break. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1873.92s)]
*  No, I want to talk about the Jets after that. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1876.8400000000001s)]
*  Cause there was a crazy article that so big athletic article today about the [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1878.3600000000001s)]
*  Jets and the ownership and the sons and EA ratings and Jerry [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1881.64s)]
*  Judy, this became an immediate everybody texting everybody the same thing. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1886.48s)]
*  It's on every NFL teams, Reddit. It's, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1891.28s)]
*  it just became one of those stories of the year. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1894.28s)]
*  A lot of anecdotal stuff that I think had been floating around plus some new [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1896.64s)]
*  information. And guess what? [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1900.32s)]
*  The TLDR was like, Hey, the Jets are super dysfunctional, which we knew already. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1903.84s)]
*  But I think what I didn't realize was how kind of medley [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1908.32s)]
*  Woody Johnson is. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1914.24s)]
*  And people had always said when he was doing the ambassador thing, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1915.6s)]
*  it was nice and Woody's out. But then when he came back, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1918.28s)]
*  that's when it got a little, a little crazy again. So in retrospect, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1921.16s)]
*  like both of us were bullish on the Jets. You were even more bullish than I was. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1925.76s)]
*  But this team was so dysfunctional. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1930.44s)]
*  It's not like we didn't know they were dysfunctional. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1932.8799999999999s)]
*  So what made any of us think that this team was going to suddenly become [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1934.76s)]
*  functional? And is there any way out of this with this owner? [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1938.04s)]
*  Yeah. That article dropped today and it was like, I got, you know, a lot of, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1941.96s)]
*  and a lot of that stuff, like I can't, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1946.24s)]
*  I can't discredit a lot of it that's in Diana's article with Mike Silver and [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1948.32s)]
*  Zach Rosenblatt. And like, look, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1952.3999999999999s)]
*  when Woody took that UK ambassador job from president Trump in 2017, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1954.8s)]
*  his sons, brick and Jack were 11 and nine. And it's like, you know, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1960.32s)]
*  11 years old and nine years old. He goes away. Christopher Johnson, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1964.04s)]
*  his younger brother takes over and suddenly like the Jets building, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1967.24s)]
*  it was like, all right, they're leaders in social justice. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1971.28s)]
*  And Christopher Johnson's giving Kelvin Beacham like an opportunity to speak on [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1974.12s)]
*  behalf of the team. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1978.0s)]
*  And it was right through all of like this turbulent time in the NFL and the Jets [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1978.8s)]
*  were leaders in the space. And it was like, gosh, like everyone was, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1982.92s)]
*  was pretty impressed with the Jets organization. And then they hire Sala, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1986.16s)]
*  they hired Joe Douglas and then Woody comes back and his sons are suddenly, [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1989.72s)]
*  you know, of high school and college age. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1994.1200000000001s)]
*  And then you go to these Jets games and you see the sons pregame and they're [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1996.04s)]
*  like on the sidelines and they look cool. And they got the blazer on, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=1999.76s)]
*  and they got the sunglasses on and they're walking the sidelines. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2003.92s)]
*  And it's like these, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2006.48s)]
*  this is a freshman at Harvard and a kid in boarding school and their dad and [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2008.6000000000001s)]
*  mom owned the New York Jets and they have all access to do, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2013.4s)]
*  like I don't spite the kids and I don't spite the owner, but what it is, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2016.6399999999999s)]
*  it is true. Like these kids are around. And I actually, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2020.56s)]
*  I feel like bad for, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2024.9599999999998s)]
*  I feel bad for brick the older one because everyone says he's actually a good kid. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2026.32s)]
*  And it's like, he's getting limb bastard in this article. Yeah. Madden thing. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2029.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to discredit that like things like Madden ratings could come in, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2033.32s)]
*  but like I've spoken to sources like the Jerry Judy trade wasn't happening [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2036.9199999999998s)]
*  because the Cleveland Browns offered something better. And that's why it wasn't, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2040.4399999999998s)]
*  because his Madden rating wasn't what it was. But I will say, you know, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2043.48s)]
*  I don't know if this will be breaking it, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2048.28s)]
*  but like Joe Flacco was with the team two years ago and Flacco was a good [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2049.92s)]
*  veteran in the locker room for Zach Wilson. They go in, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2054.36s)]
*  they get Rogers and like the plan was let's get Rogers. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2056.6s)]
*  And like I could tell you that ownership was like, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2059.76s)]
*  I don't know if we want to go that direction. Like let's, let's, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2062.2400000000002s)]
*  let's go with Rogers and let's go with Zach and let's figure out else we do. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2065.12s)]
*  Like I don't want a big page. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2067.7200000000003s)]
*  Then Joe Flacco goes on to win comeback player of the year. And you're like, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2069.2000000000003s)]
*  and like little things like that where I, I know the owners, it's true. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2073.12s)]
*  Like I know that Woody was like sometimes in the draft, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2077.04s)]
*  like will show displeasure if it's a pick he doesn't like. Like that is fact. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2080.04s)]
*  I've heard that from ex employees and that's a lot of this. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2083.44s)]
*  There are a lot of ex employees from the Jets right now. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2086.08s)]
*  Which is always the most dangerous thing for a piece like this. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2088.48s)]
*  There's 20 people who are like, fuck it. I don't like that guy. Here's two stories. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2091.3599999999997s)]
*  I lost my job. Like it's, you know, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2094.52s)]
*  the Jets went through a turbulent time in 2014, 2018, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2096.44s)]
*  and now it's this year and it's always when they get rid of like a certain, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2100.4s)]
*  you know, group in the front office. And then what do they have to lose? [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2104.1600000000003s)]
*  They'll tell stories and a lot of it's probably their vantage point. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2107.2400000000002s)]
*  And there's half truths and real truths. But like the end of the day, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2110.28s)]
*  this ain't the Pittsburgh Steelers. This isn't the Kansas City Chiefs. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2114.4s)]
*  Like there certainly is some, some fissures, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2118.88s)]
*  and issues with like some of the ways things go down. But like, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2123.76s)]
*  I think all they want to do is win. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2127.68s)]
*  It's not like they're not giving the GM the green light to go get Aaron Rogers [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2130.56s)]
*  or to go trade for Devonte Adams. But I can't discredit the article. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2134.92s)]
*  But you know what? Here's the thing though. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2138.56s)]
*  And Wickersham and I talked about this last week, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2140.56s)]
*  cause I genuinely think one of the reasons Belichick went to college was he was [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2142.6s)]
*  like, if it's not the right franchise situation with the right kind of [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2146.2400000000002s)]
*  ownership, there's no meddling son of the owner, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2150.68s)]
*  anybody kind of messing with me. I probably don't want to do it anyway. Right. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2154.36s)]
*  So, so after I put that pot up, some different people reached out to me. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2159.04s)]
*  And a friend of mine was saying, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2163.8s)]
*  you should do something on your pod about the difference between NBA owners and [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2166.6000000000004s)]
*  NFL owners. Okay. I would love to hear that. You know that world. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2169.96s)]
*  I know the NFL world. The jet's ownership thing that's in a lot of buildings, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2173.4s)]
*  dude. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2178.2000000000003s)]
*  So that's the thing he was saying, like, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2179.2000000000003s)]
*  what's different about NFL owners versus NBA owners. NFL owners, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2181.84s)]
*  they own these big giant billion dollar companies. They're in a suite. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2185.1200000000003s)]
*  They're detached from the fans. They get to do what they want. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2189.6400000000003s)]
*  They'll put their son in charge here. They'll do whatever, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2192.76s)]
*  but there's still a sense of detachment. Whereas NBA owners, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2195.76s)]
*  they're in the crowd. They're with the game. Like they're, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2199.92s)]
*  they're kind of in the mix for, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2202.32s)]
*  and the type of people that have been buying NBA teams aren't like these NFL, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2204.4s)]
*  like just these super rich families passing down the team to different [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2208.2s)]
*  generations. The NBA, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2212.2s)]
*  a lot of the owners they have are people that either came up with the money [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2213.68s)]
*  themselves because they were rich or, you know, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2217.7599999999998s)]
*  they thought outside the box or they were some family that bought in or there's [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2220.3199999999997s)]
*  somebody like that Matt Ishbeau, who's like the self-made guy who's like, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2224.3999999999996s)]
*  I know how to do everything. And it's like all over the place. And, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2227.2799999999997s)]
*  but the point is like, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2231.3199999999997s)]
*  there's so many of these jet situations in the NFL and I don't feel like there's [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2233.12s)]
*  the same in the NBA. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2236.92s)]
*  There's different levels of owner and competence in the NBA, but it's, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2238.6800000000003s)]
*  it's somehow a different lane than NFL and [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2242.2000000000003s)]
*  competence. The Senate, like the jets have been like this for 15 years, right? [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2246.96s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, look, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2251.16s)]
*  I think the NFL has a different structure with ownership. So an NBA, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2252.88s)]
*  you can be a rich finance guy and you can buy a team with the NFL. A private [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2256.96s)]
*  equity can only now own up to 10% of a team. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2261.48s)]
*  They only let six different private equity companies even play a role in that. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2264.12s)]
*  That's brand new. And, and for the most part, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2267.2799999999997s)]
*  all of the owners are majority owners and it's been handed down [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2270.64s)]
*  family generation, generation, generation, like the bangles. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2275.7599999999998s)]
*  Or they bought it in the nineties or the eighties and got it at a certain price [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2280.3199999999997s)]
*  and they just have all the power. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2283.92s)]
*  But like the bangles ownership group, like that's their only, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2285.56s)]
*  that's their main income, right? Like that's their business. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2290.16s)]
*  They own the bangles. You look around and you go all the way [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2292.7599999999998s)]
*  to like the Rams, like that's a new owner, right? So the Cronkies, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2298.16s)]
*  like they obviously have a whole sorts of real estate stuff and they own all [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2302.16s)]
*  these different teams, but there are a lot of teams where the owners are [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2305.3999999999996s)]
*  families and it's handed down generation to generation. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2310.08s)]
*  And like the Steelers are one of those teams. But over the years, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2312.8399999999997s)]
*  Jimmy Haslam had a minority stake of the Steelers. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2315.96s)]
*  Then he goes and buys the Browns. David Tepper had a minority stake of the [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2318.12s)]
*  Steelers. Then he goes and becomes the majority owner of the Panthers. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2321.4s)]
*  You're not going to be a Johnny come lately in this circle and just be like, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2325.44s)]
*  I got a lot of money. I want to buy an NFL team. That's not how it works. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2328.04s)]
*  And like in New York, like Gary Vaynerchuk always says, I want to own the jets. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2330.56s)]
*  Like, and Gary V wants to own the jets. I think in different leagues, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2334.64s)]
*  like that's a possibility, but the jet, the Johnsons aren't selling this thing. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2339.0s)]
*  Like they're just not. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2343.0s)]
*  And they might give a minority piece to someone here at some point, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2344.04s)]
*  but like they'll always be 51% owners. And that's for most of these teams. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2347.0s)]
*  And the minority piece for it, for these owners, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2351.0s)]
*  like if you were to be a minority owner and you know, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2353.7200000000003s)]
*  this week we saw Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady are now minority owners of the [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2355.76s)]
*  Buffalo Bills. All right. And Josie Altador is a minority owner. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2359.28s)]
*  And Lewis Hamilton's a minority owner. And Condoleezza Rice is a minority owner. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2362.76s)]
*  And you can go all through. What is that? It's nothing other than I could say, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2366.64s)]
*  I own it. I can go to the dinner party. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2370.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's season tickets. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2372.08s)]
*  And I get season tickets and I got a spot. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2373.44s)]
*  I go to a couple of meetings. Yeah, I go to a couple of board meetings. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2375.12s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2378.0s)]
*  That the, this was figured out in the NBA over the course of the last 20 years, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2378.84s)]
*  because these, these groups would buy franchises, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2383.04s)]
*  but really like one guy was in charge and you would have these people putting in [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2386.28s)]
*  real money and they're like, fuck, I don't, I'm not in charge of anything. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2389.6s)]
*  This sucks. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2392.76s)]
*  Other than saying I'm an owner and then someone being like, but aren't, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2393.6s)]
*  but you're not that guy. And he's like, yeah, no, no, no, but I am an owner. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2395.8s)]
*  And there's enough people with egos. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2398.64s)]
*  You always talk about the rich guy tables and it's like, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2399.84s)]
*  there's so few of these teams available that to say I'm even a 0.1% [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2401.96s)]
*  owner is some cache in a Washington DC beltway dinner. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2406.96s)]
*  You know, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2411.52s)]
*  like there's all these different minority owners of the commander is like, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2411.84s)]
*  that's that social equity. It's something like, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2414.88s)]
*  but they still, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2417.88s)]
*  I think the newer owners that buy teams like that and have minority groups, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2419.44s)]
*  they're strategically picked to bring one value thing to the whole equation that [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2424.16s)]
*  they kind of need. Well, whoever it is, whether it's forward-facing, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2429.44s)]
*  somebody who's really smart, somebody who might know how to build a new arena, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2433.04s)]
*  I think when I look at some of the NBA stuff, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2437.44s)]
*  the family that operates the most like an NFL team, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2441.64s)]
*  like the dysfunctional generation by generation NFL team that just is the [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2445.12s)]
*  Lakers. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2450.64s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2451.68s)]
*  That's the team where the dad had the team really from the seventies on he passed [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2452.5s)]
*  it down to his kids. They'll never get rid of it. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2457.2s)]
*  They don't have the kind of crazy money to, you know, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2460.2s)]
*  like basically their money comes through the team from the Lakers, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2463.48s)]
*  but that there's like 10 NFL teams that operate like the Lakers. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2466.8399999999997s)]
*  So I think the giants are like that, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2469.8399999999997s)]
*  even though I know people speak highly of the Maris like that the giants have [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2471.68s)]
*  been one of the most dysfunctional franchises for over a decade now and they [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2474.8399999999997s)]
*  don't seem like they have a plan. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2478.6s)]
*  And like they, they obviously the tissues bought in as well. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2480.3199999999997s)]
*  And that goes generations too. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2483.08s)]
*  So now you have like multiple generations of tissues and Maris, but I would say, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2484.4s)]
*  you know, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2489.04s)]
*  there's a big enough family there where those people do different things outside [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2489.92s)]
*  of football and have like, like the Arizona Cardinals, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2492.7599999999998s)]
*  Michael bid wills business is the Arizona Cardinals. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2495.68s)]
*  Like he was actually a lawyer by trade and his dad passed the team down and now [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2498.56s)]
*  his ownership is the Cardinals and the Spanos family, like they all work there. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2502.2799999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of them. And, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2507.3199999999997s)]
*  and I really like John Spanos and I I've grown to become very friendly with Dean [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2509.3599999999997s)]
*  Spanos. Like, but that's the family business now. So it's, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2513.7599999999998s)]
*  it's this billion dollar company, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2517.48s)]
*  but it's being operated by families and their family. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2518.96s)]
*  Multi-billion dollar company. But then the other, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2522.7599999999998s)]
*  some of the people that have come in the last decade shot con, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2525.08s)]
*  Tepper, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2528.7599999999998s)]
*  Tepper has has the, and then the wash, the new wash. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2529.72s)]
*  Yeah. Yep. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2535.12s)]
*  Which is like the new kind of modern owner where they're buying these franchises, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2536.8399999999997s)]
*  but it's just part of a bigger portfolio for them. Right. It's not like, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2540.68s)]
*  living or dying with the success of the team. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2545.6s)]
*  Who is the NFL owner that was like sitting on the bench like Cuban was with the [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2547.7599999999998s)]
*  maps for ever. Right. Arthur blank. He owns. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2551.32s)]
*  Arthur blank was the biggest companies in the world. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2554.1600000000003s)]
*  And then he just shows up and I'll come down the sidelines, but it's just, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2556.48s)]
*  it's funny how the stakes somehow seem lower for the football owners because [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2560.32s)]
*  just owning a team in this league that is like one of the best businesses in the [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2565.6800000000003s)]
*  world. You've already won. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2569.44s)]
*  You're going to make a profit. I mean, the Jets raised season ticket prices this [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2571.36s)]
*  year. I mean, amidst all this, they, the, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2573.88s)]
*  the PSL owners were given an email like, Hey, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2575.92s)]
*  the tickets are being jacked up next year despite the season. I, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2578.1200000000003s)]
*  look at knowing that process, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2581.32s)]
*  they're going to interview everybody for a GM job. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2583.6800000000003s)]
*  And I would go in there and my advice to those GMs would be, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2586.04s)]
*  you have to find a way to finesse the egos in the room of, of like, you know, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2588.96s)]
*  obviously like what he's going to want to hear, like what your thoughts are, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2592.6800000000003s)]
*  but you're going to also have to tell them straight up. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2595.44s)]
*  Like I can also manage all of this because there is a next generation coming. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2597.04s)]
*  Like his kids aren't going anywhere. One of them is a freshman in college. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2602.76s)]
*  The other one's in high school. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2606.28s)]
*  Like they're only going to get older and more power and more emboldened. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2607.1600000000003s)]
*  And it's like, if that's a problem as a GM, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2610.16s)]
*  like you need to have the backbone to be able to say, like, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2612.2s)]
*  I can't have that around or I don't want that around. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2614.4s)]
*  And the same for the coaches. Like that's the truth of it. So, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2617.56s)]
*  the owners aren't going anywhere. I find it so naive for all these fans being [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2621.3199999999997s)]
*  like, just sell the team, sell the team. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2625.3199999999997s)]
*  Like they're 100% not selling it to even Snyder who they were, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2627.7599999999998s)]
*  they're basically trying to set his franchise on fire and he went sell the [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2631.68s)]
*  team. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2635.04s)]
*  What are some good examples of how it should work that aren't just like the [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2635.6s)]
*  Steelers passing a franchise down? Like to me, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2639.64s)]
*  it seems like the Cronkies with the Rams just realizing like, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2642.16s)]
*  Hey, we have a good front office and a great coach. Let's just trust these guys. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2647.4s)]
*  That seems how it should work on paper. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2651.56s)]
*  Yeah. So Stan Cronkie obviously owns it. His son, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2654.24s)]
*  Josh who plays a bigger role with the nuggets and with everybody likes him. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2656.72s)]
*  Josh is great. And he's in his forties and he's not look at me, not, you know, [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2660.92s)]
*  Hey, I'm in this. He's just, he's, he's there and he operates and he's very [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2665.3199999999997s)]
*  involved. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2668.52s)]
*  He's the positive upside of a legacy kid. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2669.36s)]
*  I would say you'd point to him as like, that's a success story of a legacy kid. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2672.28s)]
*  I would also say Chargers, John Spanos, who works in the front office. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2676.68s)]
*  Like he's also like, people see him out there and he like, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2679.52s)]
*  isn't about look at me and very involved. But the Cronkies though, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2682.2s)]
*  their front office is interesting. So you've got those guys. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2685.7599999999998s)]
*  Then the president is a guy named Kevin Demoff whose father Marvin was an NFL [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2688.64s)]
*  agent for many years and Kevin's been there since St. Louis. And then under him, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2692.88s)]
*  it's your GM less need. And this other guy, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2697.16s)]
*  Tony past stores who kind of manages the Cronkies as well. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2699.56s)]
*  And it's like, they're all swimming on the same thing up upstream. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2702.7599999999998s)]
*  And it's Demoff also is the president of the avalanche and the nuggets and the [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2706.36s)]
*  rapids. And it's like, there's a lot of different entities and it's all under [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2710.7599999999998s)]
*  this Cronky sports banner, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2714.16s)]
*  but Stan and Josh are never going to come in and tell Sean McVay, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2715.72s)]
*  I don't like the play call. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2719.92s)]
*  I can't say that's true for every owner around the league. Right. Yeah. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2721.04s)]
*  And that's something you can't control. It's, it's, I own the team. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2724.84s)]
*  I want to have my voice heard, you know? [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2727.48s)]
*  Yeah. Cause it seems like all of these guys have the son who, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2729.8s)]
*  or in Jerry Jones's case, the daughter that everybody likes Charlotte, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2735.36s)]
*  who everybody thinks is good, but everyone has the son for the most part. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2738.5600000000004s)]
*  And then if you ask other people, I'm talking NBA, NFL, whatever, like, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2743.32s)]
*  so what's the son like? And it could go one of three ways. They could be like, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2748.0800000000004s)]
*  Oh, he's good. He's really good. Like, it's almost like surprising. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2751.7599999999998s)]
*  Or they'll be like, eh, you know, he's pretty sharp, I guess. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2755.36s)]
*  Or he's Tommy Callahan. He's Tommy boy. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2758.24s)]
*  Well then there's the third one where it's like, what's the son like? [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2760.16s)]
*  And they go, you know, [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2763.12s)]
*  and then you're like, Oh, it must be a disaster. Yeah. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2767.96s)]
*  This guy must be the absolute fucking worst. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2770.96s)]
*  Which is why I want to give a pass to Woody's kids who got killed in this [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2773.0s)]
*  athletic article. Bill, they're your sons age. They're my sons age. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2776.0s)]
*  They're your sons age. What are you doing? You're telling the kids. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2779.96s)]
*  Like I remember before the Superbowl in Arizona, and I don't know if I should [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2782.4s)]
*  say it, but I will. We're walking around the field. It was a Fox Superbowl. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2784.88s)]
*  So I have all access and I'm walking around with, with Michael Vick, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2787.8s)]
*  Charles Woodson and Sean Payton and Goodell comes over and Jay-Z's there. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2791.2s)]
*  And there's this conversation and I like eke to the back cause I know my place [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2795.2400000000002s)]
*  in these things. No one wants to see my dad. So I'm like, and then like, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2798.52s)]
*  you know, I see Woody's kids on the field and they're like taking photos with [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2801.68s)]
*  Jay-Z and I'm like, I would do the same thing if I was a 17 year old kid at the [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2804.32s)]
*  Superbowl and my dad owned the jets and like, do you spite them for that? No, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2808.8s)]
*  it's, it's the job of everyone else to say, okay, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2812.6800000000003s)]
*  we need to put up some walls here and see like what we're going to do. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2814.44s)]
*  But where it gets dangerous is like the Jaguars where Shad Khan who owns a bunch [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2817.88s)]
*  of stuff and he's just got an incredible amount of money and they've spent money [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2822.88s)]
*  in the arena. Football team's a mess. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2826.4s)]
*  The son's kind of running the team, [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2829.1200000000003s)]
*  but he's also running AW full time and a soccer team and the soccer team. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2831.0s)]
*  I mean, if you're, if you're Belichick, and even if that was a job that was, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2835.8s)]
*  you thought, oh, if I wait a month, maybe, maybe they'll just give me the car case. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2839.5600000000004s)]
*  It's like, what is that job? I have a weird ownership situation. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2844.0400000000004s)]
*  I'm in Jacksonville, Florida, [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2848.1600000000003s)]
*  and I have no idea if my quarterback will ever be good. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2850.1600000000003s)]
*  And those will be my mid seventies. Like I, the more I think about it, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2852.88s)]
*  like I actually really like that North Carolina job for him because college jobs [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2856.48s)]
*  these days, unless you're in a perfect NFL situation, like, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2860.96s)]
*  I think Carbond Chargers, that's like a perfect situation. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2865.48s)]
*  Totally right. Or the Broncos being like, they needed him and he wanted them. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2868.6800000000003s)]
*  Broncos and he's in LA. Broncos, same thing. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2872.0800000000004s)]
*  We need you, shop, pay and hear the car keys. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2874.36s)]
*  And I just don't think that situation is there for anybody. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2877.32s)]
*  Like if you're, if you're Vraeble now, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2879.88s)]
*  and I think Vraeble is the best candidate of all these guys. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2882.28s)]
*  If you're Vraeble, what's the situation where you're like, oh, [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2884.7200000000003s)]
*  oh, that's a no brainer. I got to do that. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2888.48s)]
*  It's is it even Cincinnati? [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2890.1200000000003s)]
*  I look, I'm going back to Belichick. There could be two truths. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2892.96s)]
*  I know Lombardi comes on your podcast and we love Mike and I have exchanged [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2896.64s)]
*  text with him. There could be two truths that A, [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2900.2400000000002s)]
*  this was an amazing situation for Belichick to fall back on and B. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2902.8s)]
*  He had no NFL. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2906.92s)]
*  There was no NFL job. And, but also to their self awareness, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2908.28s)]
*  there was no job that they wanted. So it's, it's, it was a both ways. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2912.7200000000003s)]
*  Now, that's my question. Like what's the job this year? [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2916.96s)]
*  But if you're Vraeble, can you be out for two years? I don't know. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2919.68s)]
*  Like Peyton took one year off. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2923.52s)]
*  I'm not talking about him, I'm talking about Vraeble. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2924.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I'm saying for Vraeble, can you wait two years? Like, and just say, well, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2925.9199999999996s)]
*  I'm going to be, you know, pick, I'm going to wait for a better opportunity. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2928.7999999999997s)]
*  Like that's the problem. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2932.3999999999996s)]
*  You're basically waiting for the Pat's job. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2933.72s)]
*  If you're waiting an extra year, you're like, this Pat's thing is going to go [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2937.3999999999996s)]
*  badly. I'm just going to wait until it falls apart. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2940.52s)]
*  And you're walking into a situation where they didn't give you the decency of an [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2944.04s)]
*  interview last time around when you were a free agent. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2947.88s)]
*  Well that's because Krabs hired the guy five years ago. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2951.0s)]
*  And they didn't even go through the process. If you're Vraeble, well, what the, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2952.88s)]
*  what, you know, and the story I got today that I think went out that Greg [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2955.88s)]
*  Bedard, who I think is very plugged in, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2959.32s)]
*  so that you can get a Vraeble, McDaniels, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2961.56s)]
*  and like the whole band can go back to New England. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2964.36s)]
*  When everyone thought that was the crew go and not Vraeble, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2967.48s)]
*  but everyone thought McDaniels, Patricia, well, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2969.56s)]
*  Belichick hasn't hired any of those guys yet. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2972.8s)]
*  Like I think they got to work out contracts with those guys. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2974.48s)]
*  So you might be able to get the band back together up in New England. I, [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2976.72s)]
*  I mean, would you want to go back there if you're Vraeble after they didn't even [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2981.16s)]
*  give you the look the first time? [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2983.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't think, I don't think it was a slap in the face that they didn't give them [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2985.2s)]
*  a look. I think the Mayo thing had been done for a couple of years. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2988.24s)]
*  So that was one of my questions for you actually to do a little coach watch [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2991.9199999999996s)]
*  because we have Jet Saints Bears open. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2996.24s)]
*  Watching the last three weeks of the season. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=2999.16s)]
*  Peterson, I'm guessing that's a rep in Jacksonville, right? [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3001.44s)]
*  Yes, I would think. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3006.44s)]
*  So there's four spots. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3007.68s)]
*  Dayball seems like he's coming back. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3010.56s)]
*  And my guess is they'll give him one more year and then they'll hire [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3013.84s)]
*  new people for the front office. And that's how that plays out. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3018.44s)]
*  But maybe they won't hang. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3021.16s)]
*  Oh, you think the G I think the GM is safe in New York. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3022.7200000000003s)]
*  I think Joe Shane is safe. I think the GM is safe. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3025.64s)]
*  So Dayball's not safe. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3027.32s)]
*  I don't, I don't know if he's a hundred percent safe. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3028.64s)]
*  I would think if it's up to the Marys, they would love to just get the season [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3030.68s)]
*  over with and keep both of them. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3033.7599999999998s)]
*  OK, well, there have been pencil that in. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3035.52s)]
*  There have been planes above MetLife, the last two home games saying, [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3037.52s)]
*  please end this misery fire. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3041.72s)]
*  Like, that's the one thing like the Marys can't stand, like when the fans [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3043.0s)]
*  are not in the building or it's an embarrassment. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3046.52s)]
*  So it could Joe Judge was safe 14 weeks through the season two years ago. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3049.3999999999996s)]
*  And then he ran a quarterback sneak with Jake from and lost it in his press [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3053.3199999999997s)]
*  conference. And it was like, we have to fire you. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3056.2s)]
*  That's where Dayball's at right now. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3057.6s)]
*  I think like you just can't melt down. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3058.92s)]
*  That's a big talking point right now with the Pats fans, because if there's [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3060.68s)]
*  if you really are completely all out on Mayo and I was a hundred percent out [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3064.92s)]
*  and then a couple of the players stuck up for him this week. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3068.96s)]
*  So now I'm like, all right, I'll give it one more week. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3071.04s)]
*  But Drake May stuck up for him. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3072.7599999999998s)]
*  Deetra Gawain stuck up for him. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3074.12s)]
*  But he's been just awful. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3075.52s)]
*  And he talks. There's this like there's this meme of like [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3077.68s)]
*  the circle. Yeah, he says something. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3081.6s)]
*  You know, Dr. Mayo makes terrible decisions. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3083.72s)]
*  Says something at press conference and then backs it and then, you know, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3085.2s)]
*  back walks it back, but sort of also puts a foot in his mouth. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3087.92s)]
*  Like it's been. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3090.04s)]
*  I think he said four times this this year in the preseason [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3091.04s)]
*  where he said something that everybody's like, wait, what just happened? [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3095.2s)]
*  And then the next day he had to do that to clarify something I said yesterday. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3098.24s)]
*  Yeah. And I don't know how many more of those he gets. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3102.8399999999997s)]
*  The Arizona game was alarming, but, you know, they got Buffalo this week. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3106.08s)]
*  They got Buffalo in the last week. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3110.4s)]
*  Which might actually mean something for Buffalo. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3112.0s)]
*  So to me, Mayo's on the coach watch list, even though I don't think [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3113.8s)]
*  Craft will fire him up. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3117.56s)]
*  I don't think they want to either. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3118.56s)]
*  I think that's a they would love to not admit a mistake. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3119.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3122.56s)]
*  And like they would love to ride this thing out one more one more season. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3123.36s)]
*  But the thing is, that's fine that they don't want to admit a mistake [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3126.0s)]
*  and maybe he deserves a second year. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3128.64s)]
*  The difference is variable. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3131.64s)]
*  I just think variable is a great coach. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3134.52s)]
*  I like if that's going to cost you very little, I think you're going to have to [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3136.32s)]
*  play a lot of games. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3139.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean, I think he's a great coach. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3140.08s)]
*  I like if that's going to cost you variable, you're in the same situation [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3141.3199999999997s)]
*  like the Jets were in, but they could add variable a year ago, probably. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3144.72s)]
*  And they brought back Salah when it clearly wasn't going to work. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3147.8399999999997s)]
*  Pierce on Vegas. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3150.68s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3153.52s)]
*  I mean, look, I've been depending on how the next three games go. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3154.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I can't say I'm I'm positive he's coming back. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3157.72s)]
*  Same. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3161.16s)]
*  But I also can't say I'm positive he's gone. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3161.9599999999996s)]
*  I also think it was reported by Ian Rappaport this week. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3163.8799999999997s)]
*  I think it's a secret on the quarterback spot that Brady's like not just going to be [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3168.04s)]
*  a silent owner and posing for photos like Brady's going to have a voice in this [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3172.52s)]
*  and is going to play a role. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3176.28s)]
*  And so I know there's no great connection, but they are former players. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3177.28s)]
*  And obviously, Brady and Pierce have a relationship from their playing days. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3182.08s)]
*  But I think Brady plays a role in this as well, and they're going to value his opinion. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3185.6s)]
*  All right. Here are the three I got to get your take on. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3189.96s)]
*  And I'm watching this for the next three weeks. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3192.1600000000003s)]
*  There's always a surprise. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3193.84s)]
*  I can't believe they let go of that guy, Coach. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3195.0s)]
*  Mike McDaniel, Miami. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3197.96s)]
*  They just gave him a huge contract extension, but Stephen Ross's money is not an issue. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3199.92s)]
*  So, OK, go on. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3203.2400000000002s)]
*  Shane Steichen in Indianapolis. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3205.04s)]
*  OK. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3207.0s)]
*  Kyle Shanahan in San Francisco. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3208.84s)]
*  Those would be my three. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3211.68s)]
*  I'd be shocked if they if they were let go one day after the season, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3214.28s)]
*  but I also wouldn't be shocked. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3217.96s)]
*  And then I guess maybe you could put Zach Taylor in there, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3220.44s)]
*  but I think there's a chance the Pickles could make the playoffs. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3223.28s)]
*  And also not to talk about finances in that kind of way, but like the Bengals are not ones. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3226.76s)]
*  Yeah, they're not they're not looking to pay two coaches at once. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3231.92s)]
*  Right. When you when you decide to have a team of like half rookies and undrafted free agents, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3234.6400000000003s)]
*  maybe they want to pay two coaches. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3239.2000000000003s)]
*  So McDaniel, Steichen, Shanahan. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3240.96s)]
*  Rank in order of what would surprise you the most. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3244.48s)]
*  Shanahan would surprise me the most. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3247.92s)]
*  I know it's it's been it's a very, very dark year there in San Francisco. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3249.6s)]
*  Like knowing Jed very well, knowing John Lynch very well there, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3254.6s)]
*  there and knowing Kyle very well, they're trying to be upbeat. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3258.64s)]
*  But like this season started with the lockouts, which was sour as it was. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3261.48s)]
*  And then their first round pick got shot. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3266.04s)]
*  And it was like, OK, that's a major adverse situation. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3268.64s)]
*  Let's try to work through it. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3271.84s)]
*  Then they proceeded to lose their running back right before the season. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3273.2s)]
*  That was their offensive player of the year in the league. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3275.64s)]
*  And then like, I don't want to be, you know, like you've had players have real tragedies in their life. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3278.2799999999997s)]
*  Like Trent Williams lost a kid this this this season, like real dark stuff on top of all these injuries. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3283.68s)]
*  And it's like just get to the finish line. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3290.12s)]
*  And I don't think Kyle Shanahan is going to pay the price for this year. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3291.96s)]
*  It's one of those truly brutal. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3294.8399999999997s)]
*  The official year from all seasons. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3298.2s)]
*  It's the official year from Hell Team that like as bad as things have been in New York with the Jets, [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3300.12s)]
*  like the Niners, like that's real life stuff. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3304.12s)]
*  And it has been so bad. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3306.68s)]
*  And they're just trying to stay above it when they beat the Bears in that game. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3308.2799999999997s)]
*  There was like a feeling of like great relief and like just that we got to win. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3312.16s)]
*  And last week was atrocious on Thursday night at home in front of their crowd losing 12-6 to the Rams. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3317.08s)]
*  Like it's just get to the end. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3322.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't think Kyle Shanahan unless he has some major blow up with Jed, which I don't think is happening. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3324.48s)]
*  Stiken and Ursa, I don't know enough. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3329.48s)]
*  I know Ursa had it had his was just absolutely sick to his stomach over Carson Wentz losing to the Jaguars in a week 17 game a couple of years ago. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3331.12s)]
*  And it's like he's out like get rid of him. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3339.04s)]
*  But I don't know if that's the relationship with the coach here that he would make a rash decision, but disappointing season there. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3341.4s)]
*  And then Mike McDaniel, they gave him a monster, monster extension before the season. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3347.0s)]
*  But Stephen Ross is one of the wealthiest owners in the league. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3352.44s)]
*  And this thing has gone way off the rails and nothing would surprise me because that's the same same owner who fired Brian Flores when no one thought that was a possibility a couple of years ago. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3356.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And that goes back to what we were talking about earlier with these. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3365.84s)]
*  These owners are just so different than the NBA owners. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3368.28s)]
*  Stephen Ross is like, ah, fuck. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3371.16s)]
*  Yeah. How many how many coaches are my pa? [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3373.2799999999997s)]
*  Fuck it. I don't care. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3375.3199999999997s)]
*  And just what does he care? [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3376.3199999999997s)]
*  He's got a kajillion dollars. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3378.0s)]
*  Some of these guys are. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3379.24s)]
*  And that's a really, really attractive job as as as attractive a job as there is, is living in Miami and being the coach of the Dolphins because you have an owner with endless money and you have a really nice place to live with no taxes like these hot coaches. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3380.0s)]
*  Like, that's a really attractive place to go. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3396.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's for the Pats fans who have been horrified by how sloppy the Pats have been and the terrible strategy and just how awful they look. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3398.84s)]
*  The thing that a lot of us have focused on is that craft is just in his 80s. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3409.0s)]
*  And you don't have a ton of these seasons left, right? [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3414.92s)]
*  You can't be like, yeah, let's see one more year. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3417.6800000000003s)]
*  They're in such a unique situation with Drake May, like on a rookie contract, where it's like the single best asset you could have in sports. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3420.0s)]
*  And they have a lot of work to do. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3427.52s)]
*  And do you want to set that back here? [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3429.36s)]
*  I don't know if you do. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3430.92s)]
*  Yeah, and it's Jonathan plays a big role there. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3432.52s)]
*  Like, Jonathan Kraft plays a major role there. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3435.76s)]
*  Another son of an owner. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3438.44s)]
*  And I think I think they really, really were the way that whole thing went down with with Belichick at the end. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3439.88s)]
*  I think they really wanted this year to work out in some way. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3449.52s)]
*  Like, and it did not absolutely gone terrible. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3451.96s)]
*  Off top of your head, how many teams have benched a quarterback this year? [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3455.04s)]
*  Benched or injury benched benched for 10. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3461.7200000000003s)]
*  OK, it's a lot. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3466.28s)]
*  Cousins, Levis, Daniel Jones, Brissette, Fields, Jamis, Richardson, Flacco, back and forth. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3468.7200000000003s)]
*  Bryce Young, Minshew. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3477.32s)]
*  And I'm counting that Hayner guy. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3479.7200000000003s)]
*  Hayner, Rattler, somebody got benched in that. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3482.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3484.72s)]
*  There's benchings all over the place. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3485.48s)]
*  That's one third of the league benched their quarterback this year. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3486.96s)]
*  How are we getting worse? [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3490.16s)]
*  Not good. Not good. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3491.56s)]
*  And yet you could say that at the top of the league with Burrow and Lamar and Allen, [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3493.4s)]
*  you've got some of the best quarterback play we've ever seen. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3498.52s)]
*  There's such a gap between the great and the bad. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3500.52s)]
*  And it's it's you have one or you don't. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3503.2s)]
*  And that's just where we're at. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3505.56s)]
*  Am I crazy to think Zach Wilson should have gotten one more chance with somebody [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3507.0s)]
*  to at least start a game? [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3510.76s)]
*  He had that whole year last year and stunk. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3512.5200000000004s)]
*  Is he like 24? I don't know. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3515.0s)]
*  He's the third string in Denver. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3517.0s)]
*  How is Wentz not quarterbacking a team either? [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3518.6400000000003s)]
*  That's another one. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3521.0400000000004s)]
*  I mean, even the Chiefs. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3521.88s)]
*  There's been a lot of dialogue with the Chiefs where they're like, [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3523.1200000000003s)]
*  how is he not a starter? [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3525.96s)]
*  How is this guy a backup? He's so good. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3527.6800000000003s)]
*  It's like, well, you got to look at that Indianapolis game. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3530.48s)]
*  All right. Next topic. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3534.28s)]
*  The Kaleus Campbell release. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3537.48s)]
*  We rarely see. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3540.76s)]
*  So Miami is officially out of it. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3541.84s)]
*  You rarely see this happens in basketball right before like the March 1st deadline. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3544.2000000000003s)]
*  You rarely see a guy get released by a team who could actually hop on [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3548.92s)]
*  to a playoff team and have a dramatic impact. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3552.2400000000002s)]
*  But I feel like he could. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3555.1600000000003s)]
*  He could. The last you heard anything on this. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3556.44s)]
*  The last one was like, I think the Chiefs like signed Terrell Suggs [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3558.32s)]
*  at the end of the season. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3560.76s)]
*  He won a Super Bowl with them back in 2019. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3561.5600000000004s)]
*  And it was like, Sizzles on our team. Let's go. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3563.44s)]
*  Kaleus is like the ultimate ambassador to the league, Walter Payton, man of the year. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3565.84s)]
*  And I think he was done right here. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3569.0s)]
*  And I think he will sign with the Ravens, likely, which is a team that I think he was. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3570.16s)]
*  Oh, you think it's the Ravens? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3573.28s)]
*  I think it's one of these teams. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3574.4s)]
*  He played with the Ravens and was a beloved Baltimore Raven. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3575.76s)]
*  And if there's a place for him. What if it's the Bills? [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3578.12s)]
*  Like, could be the Bills. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3579.8s)]
*  Could be the Bills. He'll go to a contender and he'll play a role [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3581.6s)]
*  and he'll make a big play in a big game. You know that. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3583.88s)]
*  What if it's like the Packers? [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3586.12s)]
*  I'm just I'm on pins and needles, wondering where he goes. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3587.92s)]
*  Kaleus Campbell watch. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3590.48s)]
*  The hardest asset to just stumble into in week 17 would be a guy [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3591.88s)]
*  in your defensive line who can push it. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3596.24s)]
*  Defensive tackle. Yeah. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3597.88s)]
*  And he's a great teammate. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3599.48s)]
*  I have no insight. I mean, Rosenhouse is his agent. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3601.08s)]
*  I could probably get some info in a quick moment. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3603.52s)]
*  But as of now, I would think Baltimore to me always with Kaleus Campbell. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3606.28s)]
*  That's where that's where he was. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3609.76s)]
*  But he he actually wants to win a ring. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3611.08s)]
*  Go to the Chiefs, go to the Chiefs, just go to the Chiefs. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3616.44s)]
*  Just be next to Chris Jones. Just bang some bodies around. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3619.76s)]
*  OK. You watched Aaron Rodgers. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3623.36s)]
*  Yeah. Netflix doc. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3625.6800000000003s)]
*  No, just the first two episodes. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3627.24s)]
*  Did you watch any of it or no? I refuse to watch it. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3628.6s)]
*  Why? OK, I know. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3630.8399999999997s)]
*  I know your team, Jimmy Kimmel and cousin Sal, but you won't even watch it. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3631.8799999999997s)]
*  They do it. Nothing. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3634.68s)]
*  I would actually watch it despite Jimmy. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3635.72s)]
*  My friend. No, I just don't want to spend. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3640.0s)]
*  I don't spend, you know, valuable TV time with a filmmaker. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3644.4799999999996s)]
*  I watched the rock doc. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3648.9599999999996s)]
*  Oh, my friend got texted you. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3650.3999999999996s)]
*  This is a good doc. I'm not trying to. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3651.9599999999996s)]
*  I'm not trying to make it. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3653.8799999999997s)]
*  Those guys are really good at what they do. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3654.9599999999996s)]
*  I'm sure it's well done. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3656.68s)]
*  I just don't want to hang out with Rodgers for two hours. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3658.04s)]
*  I would tell you this. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3660.7999999999997s)]
*  And I know we've had a lot of discourse on the player producing editorial control. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3663.2s)]
*  And this isn't look, this isn't Ken Burns baseball. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3667.7999999999997s)]
*  This isn't an objective look at this thing. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3670.44s)]
*  It's Rodgers's story. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3672.12s)]
*  But the second episode, he goes on this ayahuasca trip with Jordan Poyer [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3673.2s)]
*  and Adrian Colbert and Poyer's mom. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3676.72s)]
*  And it's like it goes to places that I don't know exist. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3678.48s)]
*  And it's interesting. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3681.2s)]
*  The first episode, it really is good football shit, man. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3682.24s)]
*  Like, really? [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3686.6s)]
*  It's yes, it is a football doc, too. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3687.56s)]
*  Like, I am telling you, you go and you forget how close he was [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3690.2s)]
*  when he was with the Packers and all those games and Packers fans [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3694.8399999999997s)]
*  were saying, like, no, no, we know. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3698.4s)]
*  But like, you know, the Giants, they beat him when he was a 15 and one quarterback. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3699.64s)]
*  19 straight wins. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3703.24s)]
*  He loses the Giants in the playoffs, the Falcons in the NFC championship game. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3704.16s)]
*  All those 49ers losses, the Buccaneers a couple of years ago. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3708.72s)]
*  But what was really interesting is that you get into Rodgers like [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3711.7999999999997s)]
*  and he's always searching. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3715.88s)]
*  He's like seeking for something that I almost feel just a lot of empathy and sympathy. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3716.88s)]
*  Like, he's a single guy in his 40s right now. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3720.92s)]
*  And he's like, I'm searching, I'm searching, I'm searching. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3723.1600000000003s)]
*  And there's this whole but he says he wins the Super Bowl in 2011. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3726.44s)]
*  And his whole life's goal was proving everyone wrong [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3730.76s)]
*  and proving all those Division one schools wrong. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3734.04s)]
*  And he mentions Purdue said, like, you're just not athletic enough for Purdue. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3736.0s)]
*  And proven that he couldn't win a playoff game. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3739.4s)]
*  And they show a clip of mooch on NFL Network being like, [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3741.88s)]
*  until Rodgers wins a playoff game, [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3743.96s)]
*  he's not one of the elite guys, wins the playoff game, wins the Super Bowl. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdL2R-T_Ds&t=3745.12s)]
