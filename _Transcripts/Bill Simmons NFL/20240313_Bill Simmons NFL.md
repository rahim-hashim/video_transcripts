# Was Signing Kirk Cousins a Mistake for the Falcons? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [March 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVeJJHktzMU)
*  All right. We're going to talk quarterbacks, Kirk cousins.
*  I'm going to plant my flag on this one. I think this was a mistake. I didn't like the signing
*  Kirk cousins to Atlanta, a hundred million dollars guaranteed to a guy who's going to be 36 years old
*  in August and is coming off a torn Achilles. And this just to me seems like the classic,
*  we've been burned so many times. Here comes our hero. And you're just not even thinking
*  rationally in the last three years. They had washed up that Ryan Marcus Mariota,
*  who couldn't even finish the Netflix season, Taylor Heinecke and Desmond Ritter,
*  who had an interception montage that I actually thought might've been deep faked
*  by Falcons fans trying to, trying to get them to sign cousins. So cousins,
*  he had two 10 win seasons in Minnesota. He's one in three career in the playoffs.
*  It was own one in Washington, one and two in Minnesota in 15 and 16 in Washington.
*  And Sean McVay as his offensive coordinator, he went 17 and 14 and one Minnesota. He always
*  had digs in Thelen and then he had Jefferson and feeling, and then he had Jefferson and Osgood.
*  He always had weapons. They always had running backs really until last year with Madison suck
*  2018, week 17 to make the playoffs. I'm sorry, 2018 to make the playoffs. They have to be Chicago
*  and Mitch Trubisky and they lose 24 to 10 2019. They upset New Orleans and washed up. Drew Brees
*  and overtime in round one get killed by San Francisco. They go seven and nine and they go
*  eight and nine. And then in 22, they're 13 and four that ridiculous aberration. Oh my God,
*  that team should be eight and eight, but they're 13 and four. And they lose to Danny dimes
*  and the New York giants in round one. What am I paying for with Kirk cousins other than the
*  chance to lose in round one? What am I doing? You mentioned the Netflix show with Mariota. I
*  really feel like that Netflix show and cousins getting injured last year, the whole like thought
*  consensus on Kirk cousins has changed so much in the last 12 months. I mean, he used to be so,
*  I would make fun like, all right, you're not going anywhere with Kirk cousins. He's media.
*  He was like, yeah, he was like the line you had to get over. Is he better than Kirk cousins?
*  But now listen to how people talk about Kirk. It's crazy. Like what you said, I was looking up
*  stuff earlier today. How many times he was in Minnesota for six seasons, I think. How many
*  times do you think they had a top 10 passing DVO a offense in Minnesota with him? Six seasons,
*  one time, one time at a six season. Now he's 36 coming off an Achilles. Like you mentioned
*  different supporting cast, different scheme in Atlanta. I think it's exactly what you said.
*  I think the owner in Atlanta looked around and said, I'm tired of sitting here on Sundays in
*  the fall watching Marcus Mariota, Desmond Ritter. I can't do another year. I can't do another year.
*  I only have so many years left. I'm not watching this slop. I didn't buy a team to watch those
*  guys play quarterback. So it kind of goes back to what you asked me in the beginning, like how do
*  you compete with my homes and win a Superbowl? That's what some teams are thinking about.
*  Other organizations are looking at it like the last three years have been the Arthur Smith era
*  was a disaster. I want to have fun watching my team. Maybe we'll win the NFC South. Maybe we'll
*  win a playoff game. If we do, it doesn't really matter. Like, well, you know, if we lose in the
*  first round, that's okay. We're in the playoffs. Like this is not a move you make. If you're like,
*  we need to do the best thing for the franchise to win a Superbowl. This is a move you make.
*  If you say we want to raise the floor, we want to be competent. The owner's tired of being
*  embarrassed. Other people want to keep their jobs and you're like, all right, we'll sign Kurt
*  Cousins. So I think he'll operate like, I don't know, what do you think the 12th or 14th best
*  starter in the NFL? I have my list. I'm glad you asked. Okay. All right. Okay. Perfect. My initial
*  QB tiers. Ready? My home's on his own. Okay. Alan Burrow, Herbert Lamar and Stroud. I think are the
*  next five. I couldn't put Stroud lower than six. I just get, there's no way he's not going to be
*  better. Right? From what we saw, he'll be like, I don't know, 10% better next tier. So that's six
*  Stafford hurts, Dak, love and Purdy. I think Purdy has to be on there. Now I'm at 11. Next tier.
*  Roger's. Goff. Now I'm at 13. Now I'm dropping Lawrence Cousins to a Mayfield Kyler in some order.
*  And that's from 14 to 18. What was your, what's your biggest disagreement with that list?
*  Well, I was, I really don't want to be the person who is on here,
*  stumping for Trevor Lawrence, but I think there's probably a case that he's just one tier up. I'm,
*  I don't need to put him in the elite category. Put him in the Roger's goth. You'd have him as
*  the third guy in that tier. Okay. There was, wait, there were, I think, and Purdy, like,
*  would you rather have Purdy than goth? That one, I was like,
*  Okay. So I can move Purdy down a tier. Yeah. There's a lot of guys in there that were,
*  I was like, and I just am, I I'm leading the Jordan love hype train, but I think you had him in the
*  right tier. It's been one year as a starter there. And so I think that was fine. So, okay. You have
*  him right, right. You have cousins right there. Right. Let me, so I'll do it again. All right.
*  Let me, I'm going to, I'm going to take more notes. Let me take my home. Okay. My homes,
*  Allen burrow Lamar, Herbert Straub, Stafford hurts, stack loves. So I would make love number 11. Would
*  you have love ahead of DAC? Uh, for, for one year, probably not. It's a good argument. I might,
*  I love love. Yeah. I think he's, he's, he's fantastic. It's in the mix. So then another drop,
*  Rogers, Purdy, goth, Lawrence, in some order, all of them upside with like one thing that makes you
*  go, so Purdy, it's like, yeah. Meanwhile, what else does he have to show us? Like the guys,
*  two years in a row led teams that had a chance to win a super bowl. First time he gets hurt
*  last year comes down a two third down plays where the defense called a great look on him. Right.
*  Rogers, I have no idea. You can tell me Rogers is going to be too, too higher, two tiers higher,
*  two tiers lower. Goff that's right around where he should be. Yeah. Lawrence is the one. I just
*  don't know if Lawrence is good. I have no idea. I think that's fair. I mean, like I just look at it
*  as who are the guys who like probably the only guys, you know, like if you have them,
*  you're going to be in the mix. It might only be my homes and Allen, like Allen,
*  they're doing all this stuff. And guess what? They're still probably going to have a top eight
*  offense. Burrows in there for me. I love burrows. Like a guarantee. Yeah. The only thing that the
*  only reason I didn't put them right away was maybe the durability's had a couple of seasons,
*  but I love burrow. I'm in on burrow Stroud. You could honestly make the case as high as three
*  for me. And I wouldn't be laughing at you. Yeah. Stroud versus Herbert is like an actual
*  argument. I would, I would take Stroud right now. I mean, I love it. I mean, look at what he did
*  with that support. I think football outsiders had, it was like the most injured offensive line
*  since they started tracking this stuff. And for other quarterbacks, you're making excuses for that.
*  Right. For him, he's a rookie. He's got Nico Collins and not a lot else. And look how good
*  injuries can elevate and injuries. So he was able to elevate his group. So I like Stroud
*  in that top tier. And when I do the trade value updates in the summer for NFL, I'm afraid to know
*  how high I'm going to put CJ Stroud there. I mean, yeah, I mean, he could be a top CJ Stroud could
*  be a top five guy. Oh yeah. Oh, five. Yeah. Right. Like higher than four for me. He might be three.
*  He might be three. He might be three for me when you factor in the rookie contract.
*  Cause if it's like Stroud and those other guys. So anyway, so that last tier with Cousins, Tua,
*  Mayfield and Kyler, I think is the right spot for Cousins at 36 years old coming off an Achilles
*  injury. And you can say like, well, why wouldn't Rogers be there? He's 40 years old coming off
*  an Achilles, but I don't know. Rogers just has a better track record. They've been if he's older.
*  Yeah. I'm probably lower on Mayfield than you are in that group. I would have him lower.
*  There Kyler is a hard one to predict, but yeah, I think that's around the right spot where if the
*  supporting cast is good, there's like all these guys, there's probably 12 guys where you could say
*  if the supporting cast is good and the coaching is good, you could have them as high as maybe like
*  eight or you could have them as low as 20. Like it is a wide group there. Once you get beyond the,
*  you know, five, six, seven, eight guys who you feel really good about. So I think that's probably
*  where Cousins is. And now it's just a matter of like, how good is that supporting cast? What's
*  their ceiling going to be like? I could, I would pick them. How good is that supporting cast? Like,
*  yeah. Do you absolutely love Drake out, Drake London? Do you absolutely love Kyle Pitts? Like,
*  yeah, I'm like, ah, yeah, they're, they're, they have potential. I wouldn't say like I had both of
*  them on fantasy teams. So watch them pretty closely. Drake London, he'd have a couple of big games,
*  but I don't, do I think he's going to be like a top five receiver? No. And then Bijon, I don't know
*  that that's one where he might be awesome next year and it wouldn't be shocking.
*  Yeah. It's so much based on just where they were drafted and you know, you're like, well,
*  that Arthur Smith era was not great in Atlanta, but you're right. Like Drake London is not Justin
*  Jefferson. Like that matters a lot for the, I mean, we've watched, there were games where
*  Justin Jefferson is just taking the game over. I really didn't matter who was throwing him the
*  football. There's nobody like that on the Falcon. So it's a group with potential, but I'm with you
*  unproven. I think you convinced me I've been on the fence with the cousins thing, like not having
*  a firm stance. I think I want to join you. Yeah. I think part of, I honestly think you were right
*  about the Netflix thing. I think it shifted the narrative on him in a really weird way. And people
*  felt bad because he got hurt and the outpouring from his teammates. I mean, the big thing, if
*  you're going to make the case for the signing for Atlanta, other than what you said about the owner
*  was he's an awesome, awesome, awesome locker room guy and a leader and somebody that can come in.
*  At least now you have like somebody who can drive your car, whether you can drive it well enough.
*  I guess we'll find out. I was looking at, you know, they had to have some unfindo. They have
*  some of the division odds and this cousin thing, it surged the Falcons. They're like minus one 10
*  minus one 15. Now to win the NFC South, I'm like, to me, it's like, there's no, first of all, to
*  say those are the odds at this point is ridiculous. We didn't have the draft yet, but I just don't
*  think them versus Tampa, them versus New Orleans to me, that's a crap shoot. So if I'm getting
*  over three to one value on the saints or the bucks, I'm just grabbing that over
*  thinking Atlanta is going to be a prohibitive favorite. I don't see that at all.
