# Bill Simmons Is Not Panicking About the Patriots | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glZ4xpfjb_w)
*  Let's do a little panic meter.
*  We'll just rip through this really quick.
*  It scores from one to 10 Baltimore offense.
*  I'm at, I'm at probably a four because we know Dobbins will come back.
*  I didn't realize Dobbins tore his hamstring too, when he tore all of his ligaments.
*  He's need Jesus.
*  He practiced, he practiced today and it's being treated like a big deal.
*  But like, gosh, that's a serious, serious, like he's not back to week six.
*  Gone 14 months.
*  Ronnie Stanley's out.
*  Bateman and DuVernay.
*  DuVernay, I think is going to be your classic.
*  Everyone picks him up.
*  Go.
*  Everyone picks him up week one fantasy and then he's starting to get waved by week four, week five.
*  I'm at probably a four out of 10 with their offense.
*  Where are you?
*  Yeah, I'm about a panic meter.
*  I'm about a little bit higher.
*  I'm more of a like a five or a six because I think the Greg Roman offense has been employed for a long time.
*  And the thought was all right.
*  But that was last year when they were struggling down the stretch.
*  That wasn't with Lamar.
*  Then it didn't have any pop to it.
*  Week one against the Jets.
*  I'd say I'm more of a five or a six.
*  And just because of who they have to play against in the AFC.
*  Like, I don't know if that offense is going to be able to keep up with the Bills and the Chiefs long term.
*  Trey Lance, I'm at an eight.
*  I want to see him in nice weather.
*  It could be a three next week.
*  I'm not as concerned.
*  I'm going to say six.
*  I'm going to say six because of the weather and because he didn't have Kittle and because
*  he's not going to have Kittle this week.
*  Kittle didn't practice today.
*  I know. I know.
*  I just I wouldn't.
*  That game last week, I think a lot less credence in than anything.
*  I don't I'm not panicking.
*  What about the whole preseason and the fact that they ended up bringing back the quarterback who they had hiding in a closet for a month and a half?
*  I hear you.
*  Two I'm an eight and a half.
*  Yeah, I'm not.
*  I'm with you. I'm seven or eight.
*  And we might be proving to fool.
*  I can just tell you how I felt having the Pats and underdog parlay plus the Pats are my team.
*  And every time to was back to pass with some time, I was I thought he was going to throw us a pick.
*  Kyle and I were watching that game go throw to us to throw to us.
*  Like we just had complete confidence that he and he tried.
*  He tried to throw a cut.
*  We dropped a couple.
*  Yeah, I don't see it.
*  And I think Mike Daniel McDaniel is going to get the best of him.
*  If that's the like all off season, we heard that to throw in this amazing.
*  Like I didn't see it week one.
*  I'll be curious to see it against a good Ravens defense.
*  So, yes, I'm with you.
*  I'll tell you this.
*  It is freaking frightening to go against Tyreek and Waddle.
*  How good are they?
*  I didn't like that at all.
*  And if they can if they can figure out how to harness to at all or maximize whatever
*  he's good at, maximize, which I guess is just two step drops, quick throws.
*  That's that's there.
*  That's there, though.
*  And McDaniel can coach that.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  The Pats, I'm at a five.
*  I'm at a ten.
*  That was tell me why that was that offense was a neat.
*  Like I think they knew it.
*  We knew going in that there's that offense was atrocious, Bill.
*  And now I was a 10 on Sunday.
*  Now I'm a five.
*  Talk talk me out of a 10.
*  Now back his back spasms and Mac is missing practice because a non covid.
*  Really? I don't know.
*  I thought the defense was very good and I thought they moved the ball that opening
*  drive, but at no point does it feel like that team can go up and down with a team
*  offensively. It was really bad.
*  Well, I thought we were going to go seven and 10 this year, so maybe that's why I'm
*  at a five.
*  I I actually the defensive line, there are some really good pressure numbers.
*  I was at the summer linings.
*  They look great. They had a 40 percent pressure rate.
*  I was like, wow, the Amazon next gen stats say.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  If there's a decent they ran the ball, they had a couple of good drives.
*  They really lucked out with playing Pittsburgh this week with no T.J.
*  Watt, who was a one man wrecking machine and we went limping, nausea and limping.
*  Naji, who like either way of Naji plays in his heart.
*  That's good for us.
*  He doesn't play. That's good for us.
*  Didn't you feel like and I know that there's been a lot made in the media about
*  Kendrick Bourne only having, I think, two targets and only getting thrown to one.
*  Very strange.
*  Didn't it feel like it was a great talent disparity, the Patriots offense to the rest
*  of the Dolphins offense and defense?
*  I didn't feel like there was three units that were really belonging on that field.
*  And there was the Patriots offense.
*  I just think Tyreek was so clearly better than anyone else in the game.
*  And one of the things McDaniel did was he was just like, hey, you know what?
*  I should get Tyreek the ball.
*  Go one yard. I'll throw you a little nothing.
*  Yeah.
*  That was a little quick reverse.
*  Here's this. Here's that.
*  Go deep this time.
*  And, you know, that man, he's a neighbor.
*  Dallas, I am a 10.
*  I was probably an eight heading into the season.
*  I actually think they have a chance to be a top five worst team this year.
*  Yeah. If Dax out for a while.
*  The part with the Dax, him getting hurt was like, they look terrible before he got hurt.
*  They couldn't move the ball at all.
*  And he looked awful.
*  Awful. You know, you have so much money into Dax and Zeke and Tyron Smith.
*  Now you got two of those three of those guys out.
*  So it's like, all right, Zeke, you make 16 million a year, whatever you make.
*  Like, can he care us? And it's not even a question.
*  It's not even like there's not even a thought that, OK, well, they've got Ezekiel Elliott.
*  They could just rely on him.
*  Anyone with reality, like looking at this is like that's not going to win the games for them.
*  So, again, talent on offense, offensive line, atrocious.
*  They are so invested on this, this steal on the offensive line.
*  He had three penalties and one drive.
*  Like it was bad before Dax got hurt.
*  The Dax getting hurt was almost a scapegoat.
*  And I don't think they're going to potentially make a leap once he gets back.
*  So I'm with you. I say eight or nine Arizona.
*  I'm probably higher on the panic than you.
*  I'm nine and a half.
*  No, I've got serious concerns.
*  I picked them to go to the playoffs and I watched them on Sunday.
*  And I don't I don't see how they're going to win a lot of games this season either.
*  And I'm probably a seven or an eight.
*  I it's it's it could be a long.
*  I love how you won't commit to a number.
*  You're like, oh, I'm in the seven, eight.
*  Right. Can I put you down for an eight?
*  Yeah. Eight. How about the Eagles defense?
*  I listen to we have this great Philly pod now.
*  It's just a body and so like and they're just like dissecting the Eagles defense.
*  You know, like it's unbelievable.
*  Like it's the mortgage market on some financial podcast.
*  It's like a niche thing. Right.
*  But I've got I've got a friend, Larry, who's diehard Eagles and they win.
*  And like I expect his usual like fly, he goes fly emoji or whatever the hell
*  he's going to send me. And instead, he's like, I'm wallowing in like three drinks over here.
*  I'm like, why is like this revamped defense socks and Gannon, our defensive coordinator, socks.
*  We're old as shit.
*  Everyone's old. Why are we getting older?
*  I'm like, I look at it.
*  I'm like, you guys were up, I think, 38 to 14.
*  They had a couple of touchdowns at the end. You still won.
*  I wouldn't stress yet.
*  But Eagles fans seem like this is the end of the world based on the way they explain.
*  They couldn't stop the run and they couldn't get pressure, which I think were two things.
*  Eagles fans were counting on.
*  I'm at a seven and a half for them.
*  What are you? Eagles defense only.
*  I'm at a five.
*  Minnesota Monday night.
*  Now we have primetime Kirk on the one hand, but on the other hand,
*  we have this Minnesota offense that looks like a juggernaut.
*  The fun game. Yeah, it could be a good one.
*  Denver, I'm at a three. I'm with you.
*  I want to see another week.
*  I'm not ready to panic yet.
*  A little panicky about Wilson, but in general, like they put up yards.
*  Judy looked amazing.
*  At some point, they're just going to have to accept that Javante Williams
*  should play all the time. We've been talking about this since last year.
*  In the two years, just put your best guy in the field.
*  Every time he touched it, he had nine yards every time he touched it.
*  The first half, it was like, oh, let's go hand up to Javante.
*  He's carrying three guys on him. They dump it to him.
*  He just gets 10 yards.
*  I'm with you. Not at all panicked about the Broncos.
*  I actually love the way Hackett handled it Tuesday. Salivating media.
*  We've seen a million coaches come out and be like, we trust our numbers.
*  We trust our process. He's like, you know what?
*  In hindsight, I would have done it differently.
*  But OK, like, let's move on.
*  Like I said, 12 penalties,
*  you know, two fumbles on the one yard line.
*  Crazy shit happened in that game.
*  I think you you you clean you wipe it off.
*  You clean the board.
*  Russell, week two against Houston, go to work.
*  Well, maybe it fumbles on the goal line because Melvin Gordon had one of them.
*  How many times has he fumbled inside like the five yard line?
*  A lot of Melvin Gordon.
*  Green Bay wide receivers, where are you in the panic meter for them?
*  Panic meter five, Green Bay offensive line eight.
*  All I heard about was Bakhtiari and Jenkins and how beefed up
*  they didn't make it to week one.
*  Bakhtiari's.
*  And you know, it's interesting, Minnesota didn't really torch them either
*  with all the injuries they had.
*  So I wonder if that's if there's a week where that comes,
*  where that line just gets demolished.
*  Yeah, I felt like Rogers was on was was doing a little happy feet at some point.
*  And every time he would escape, Zedarius Smith was in his face.
*  I'm a little concerned about things that aren't receiver.
*  I feel like they'll figure the receiver out.
*  Watson was open. Everyone.
*  Yeah, we know he dropped it, whatever.
*  But I look at that offensive line without those two studs.
*  And then I look at no Nathaniel Hackett and no Luke Getzi.
*  That's an offensive coordinator. That's a quarterback's coach.
*  And if you ever watched Rogers on the sidelines the last two seasons, his MVP years,
*  he was in both those guys ears and he was talking with them.
*  Tom Clements, Adam Senevich, they might be the right mix,
*  but it didn't look like Rogers was at exact ease with behind that offensive line
*  and when he was on the sidelines.
