# Bill is Angry Walking About the Pats #billsimmons #podcast #patriots #nfl #shorts
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [March 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxMDnSzlh-k)
*  I read two depressing pieces about the Patriots in the athletic today and they made me mad and now I'm angry walking
*  the first one said that they would have to overspend just to get any free agents because
*  We have the cheapest owner in the league by spending the last ten years. We have an interim GM
*  We have a completely unproven coaching staff and we don't really have that many good players
*  So needless to say people aren't lining up to pay for the Patriots and we're not to overpay them
*  So we're like a 90 euro billionaire
*  Who has a 30 year old girlfriend that he has to lavish with gifts just to get her to look at your saggy scrotum
*  Once a week, that's Patriots right now
*  second
*  There was a mock draft where the Patriots traded back from three to eight with Atlanta and picked up a second round pick this year
*  And a first round pick next year and took a left tackle as their pick who would probably end up being the best player in
*  The team and it made me realize after six Super Bowls an incredible two-decade run
*  I'm back to where I started as a teenager in the early 80s when the Patriots were terrible. They were cheap
*  They were becoming a laughingstock and our best player was an offensive lineman. I'm back, baby
