# Can Brock Purdy Lead the 49ers Into the Playoffs? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [December 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoNzfkJwB4I)
*  Let's talk about the San Francisco 49ers and my guy, Mr.
*  irrelevant.
*  Yeah.
*  Jimmy might come back.
*  Maybe not.
*  Who knows?
*  My question is, do they need them?
*  Do they have enough?
*  And I've been thinking about it for four days.
*  I went through some recent NFL history, just trying to figure out how
*  conceivable this, but first, before we do that, let me hear your take on what
*  you're hearing from the San Francisco side.
*  Yeah.
*  And I thought you did a nice job Monday morning.
*  He's given like the big picture on who Purdy is and Sal was pushing back.
*  Are you still talking about rock Purdy?
*  It is a cool story.
*  Obviously you gave the high school and the college story of it, but he does
*  have 41 career starts, owns all the records and then the combine process.
*  Obviously I worked for the NFL network on the draft.
*  I have to go deep dive on all these guys and there was some buzz around him.
*  I think there was a surprise that he slipped to the seventh round and
*  certainly the last pick.
*  Now some things to take away from that.
*  The way it went in San Francisco, this off season is Jimmy G wasn't around.
*  So you had Trey Lance and that was all the focus, but the number two
*  during camp was Brock Purdy.
*  So he was getting a lot of reps and he was also playing on the scout team.
*  So a lot of that stuff with, you know, Fred Warner and Eric Armstead and Nick
*  Bosa, like breathing down his neck and getting their number one reps was with
*  Brock Purdy as the scout team guy.
*  So you'd hear some buzz that like he was playing pretty good.
*  Then Jimmy comes back and now Brock Purdy is irrelevant.
*  He's a practice squad, third guy, whatever.
*  Trey Lance goes down, Brock Purdy again is the number two guy and he earned a
*  lot of respect from those defensive players.
*  So part of the big obstacle when you get these young quarterbacks is that the
*  rest of the team is like, who the hell is this guy?
*  I, you know, I live it all in the field and I've played my whole career to get
*  to this point and you're as a team going to put this guy on the field.
*  That's not the vibe.
*  And the team backed it up by a, not putting even a waiver claim in for Baker
*  Mayfield, B, not calling up Cam Newton and Ben Roethlisberger.
*  You know what?
*  You know why?
*  Because they saw the tape on those guys, their last few starts like Baker Mayfield
*  is not better than Brock Purdy at this point.
*  He's not.
*  And he has been terrible for three years.
*  Yeah.
*  And those guys haven't been there since May learning the offense, sitting in the
*  room with Brian Greasy, who is the quarterback's coach and learning from the
*  Kyle Shanahan offense, uh, what they need at the quarterback position.
*  Look, he's six foot one.
*  He's a big guy.
*  He can move.
*  And the words that I listened to are the players and you know, you hear during the
*  week that he called a timeout without Kyle Shanahan calling the timeout on the
*  sideline and the team kind of liked it.
*  They're like, all right, the rookie.
*  Like, and then you hear Fred Warner come out and say, he played against us the
*  entire year.
*  He's our scout team quarterback.
*  He's facing the number one defense.
*  And then Trent Williams told Bridget Condon from the NFL network that like, you
*  know, the stuff he's got is Peyton Manning traits.
*  And you're like, okay, slow down.
*  But he means cerebral stuff, like above the neck, all that stuff.
*  The guy is smart enough to not kill you in a big spot now.
*  And he's got a little charisma, a little swagger last week.
*  That's what like he definitely did not have deer in the headlights.
*  It was the opposite.
*  No, totally.
*  And I've gone through and I've got a whole research department that works on our
*  show. And I like really put the screws to him this week.
*  And I'm like, guys, we got to do something on Purdy.
*  And historically speaking, like who's done it?
*  And, you know, a there's no precedent for a quarterback after Thanksgiving who's
*  never played before coming in and doing this like that.
*  There's nothing. There's nothing even close.
*  There's like some in the past.
*  There's some Jeff Hostetler.
*  Yeah, I go way back.
*  There's a couple.
*  Yeah. Give us a couple of them.
*  You know, it started with like, you know, Tobin Roat and the 57 Lions.
*  We're not going to go back all the way there.
*  But you said Earl Morrell and Earl Morrell.
*  Sorry. And then, you know, Doug Williams only started two games for that for that
*  Washington team. And Jay Schrader was the guy.
*  But in the final regular season game, they benched him for Williams and he goes on
*  the run. I mentioned Hostetler.
*  Foles came in in week 14 after the ace.
*  Right. So, you know, that was that.
*  And then Brock Brock Eiswiler kind of counts.
*  Yeah, he came in what we can.
*  But he's out for the playoffs.
*  But the most comparable situation and it's it's not Trent Dilfer because he was a
*  first round pick and he came in after nine weeks is Sean King when he was.
*  Oh, yeah. All right.
*  And what was that? Ninety nine.
*  That was ninety nine. They didn't finish the job.
*  But Sean King came in after Trent Dilfer got injured in week 13 and Eric's Eric
*  Zier was the number two for that Buccaneer squad.
*  And both of those guys go down.
*  So you lose both of them.
*  And it's Dilfer and Zier.
*  They're not able to go. And Sean King comes in as a rookie at a two lane and he
*  won some big games. He won a playoff game.
*  I bet on him. I want some money on Sean King.
*  I finally remember him.
*  They were a Burt Emanuel play away, which changed the rule and a Ricky Pro catch
*  away. But also very similar to this Niners team.
*  And all defense just don't hurt you.
*  Captain, who's the defensive captain of that team?
*  John Lynch, John Lynch, who is now the GM of the 49ers.
*  And I texted Lynch this week and I'm like, is there any Sean King parallel?
*  Because I know the Sean King story very well.
*  I'm not going to make a parallel to that.
*  But, you know, off the record, now it's on the record.
*  He's like, I hear I'm picking up what you're dropping.
*  Basically, like, this could be that in a lot of ways.
*  And they've got the support of the front office, the coaching staff and the players.
*  And I'm not picking them in the Super Bowl, but I'm not picking against them to at
*  least make a little run here and do something.
*  And I think this is the first big test this week.
*  There's two teams in the 21st century.
*  That at least have the blueprint for how this could work.
*  I went through everybody.
*  Yeah, I don't think I don't want to go into the 20th century because I just think
*  football really changes.
*  And I think once we get in the 21st, at least it's a little more like what it is now.
*  2000 Ravens, you mentioned.
*  Dilfer. Dilfer's playoff stats are unbelievable.
*  First of all, in the regular season, they scored 29 touchdowns, 30 plus points four
*  times, so they weren't like impotent offensively.
*  You get to the playoffs.
*  Well, wait, the 2000 Ravens, they they benched Tony Banks after eight games and then
*  throw Dilfer in like.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  They weren't completely impotent, though, is my point.
*  But they get to the playoffs and they're basically like, Dilfer, just like and steer
*  the car. He throws 73 passes total in the playoffs.
*  He's 35 for 73, he's 500 yards total in the playoffs, four games, not three.
*  Right. It wasn't just they didn't have the bias.
*  So the four playoff games, he's less than 150 a game, three touchdowns, one pick, one
*  fumble. Their scores in the four games, they beat Denver 21-3, they beat Tennessee 24-10.
*  They beat Oakland 16-3 and they beat the Giants 34-7 where they got some defensive
*  stuff. And I think if you're going to make the case for the Niners.
*  The playoffs are looking like that, where it's like 21-3, 20-14, 17-10.
*  That's how it has to be.
*  And could they do it with Brock Peredt?
*  So here's the other one.
*  Well, wait, I mean, you remember in that and I think like Dilfer goes seven and one to
*  end the regular season, they go four and oh, but if you remember, you know, Shannon Sharp
*  had a big game against Denver.
*  That was the big story there.
*  But like, Siragusa sits on Rich Gannon's leg in the first drive of the game in the AFC
*  championship game.
*  And that's their defense.
*  And then Jermaine Lewis runs back the kick in the Super Bowl.
*  That's the special teams.
*  That's what the Niners need.
*  You're spot on.
*  The defense, I think, has a chance to be almost as good as that.
*  That Ravens team was that team was ridiculous.
*  I thought it was probably the best defense of this century.
*  So the other team is the 2015 Broncos.
*  We mentioned Osweiler earlier.
*  Yeah, 32 touchdowns that year for them.
*  They scored 30 plus twice in 16 games.
*  Osweiler probably played seven games.
*  They finished the year.
*  This is crazy.
*  24th offense in DVOA, first in defense, 28th pass offense, 31 turnovers for the season.
*  There were two turnovers a game.
*  Manning, they get to the playoffs.
*  They only have to play three games because they got to buy Manning's 51 for 92 in three
*  games, 539 yards.
*  That's about one, like 175 a game, two touchdowns, one pick, two fumbles.
*  And the scores were Pittsburgh, they beat 23-16.
*  They beat New England 20 to 18, which is still an awful Patriots loss.
*  I never want to talk about that game again.
*  Carolina, they went in the Super Bowl 24-10.
*  So they scored 23-20, 24.
*  And I think if you're making the case for the Niners and Brock Purdy, it's that
*  Broncos team more than anyone because Manning was pretty much done at that point.
*  He's still a lot about the line, but he had no arm strength anymore.
*  Purdy can at least throw the ball better than him.
*  That Super Bowl run, I followed the Broncos for Fox.
*  They just kind of embedded me with them and I went to all their playoff games.
*  And what was really interesting was everyone makes it about Peyton Manning.
*  That was Demarcus Ware's Super Bowl run in that building.
*  Like that was all, it's win one for Demarcus.
*  Like he was the leader on defense and the defense was what was doing it.
*  And in those playoff games, you remember, obviously Dante Scarnacchia wasn't the
*  coach that won here.
*  And the Patriots offensive line was obliterated by that Broncos defensive line.
*  But Manning had those two touchdown passes to Owen Daniels early in that game.
*  Two good throws.
*  Just two passes.
*  That's all he needed, those two.
*  And then it was like defense, take it away.
*  I remember Gronk had that crazy drive at the end and the catches.
*  Brady got concussed in that game too.
*  Brady was-
*  They'll never admit it, but Brady got crushed in that game and was in a fog for three quarters.
*  And then they go to the Super Bowl and Cam gets knocked around by Vaughn Miller
*  and Dexter Jackson and the defense led the way.
*  So that Broncos team finished 15 and four.
*  Probably the worst offensive team that's won the title in the last 15 years.
*  Recent history, sure.
*  Since the rules changed.
*  Yeah.
*  Since they basically changed the contact rules on pass interference, stuff like that.
*  The other thing with them was they caught the conference in the league at the right time.
*  It's a Patriots team where they had some injuries that year and then Brady gets hurt in the game.
*  The NFC was kind of goofy.
*  Carolina made the Super Bowl.
*  Carolina went 15 and won that year.
*  Do you remember the NFC championship game?
*  And you go back and you're like, how did that team go 15 and won?
*  Carolina Arizona NFC championship game.
*  Right.
*  Carson Palmer.
*  So you think like this year, moving forward to the West this year,
*  Philly is the only good team.
*  So really the question is, can they go into Philly and beat this team?
*  And then the second question that is,
*  they have the perfect team to go into Philly and beat this team.
*  As long as Brock Brady doesn't fuck it up.
*  Defensively, they could take away the run.
*  They can rush hurts.
*  I do think Philly answered some questions in that Titans game that at least I had.
*  Can you do something different?
*  They're like, yeah, we actually can.
*  We're going to throw the ball this whole game.
*  So I think they have a higher ceiling than maybe I thought a week ago.
*  And they're still going to be favored.
*  But I do think a great defense can go in and win anywhere.
*  Cold weather, 20 degrees outside, but then you get Brock Brady and 20 degree weather.
*  My point is I'm not writing off San Francisco yet.
*  I still have them second.
*  Look, if any team is going to beat the Eagles, it's that kind of team
*  that just takes the air completely out of the ball and says, yeah,
*  you've got a great offensive line, but we got a great defensive line.
*  If there's any unit in football that can go up against Jeff Stoutland's offensive line,
*  it's Chris Kucerak's defensive line.
*  And I would pay to see that ticket right there.
*  Those bodies clashing because the Eagles offensive line is by far the best
*  at what they do.
*  And the Niners defensive line is by far the best at what they do.
*  What I loved last week was the little story out of San Francisco was that in the Saturday night
*  pregame talk before this big showdown with the Dolphins, Kyle Shanahan kind of jokingly almost
*  said, hey, defensive line, we need something out of you.
*  The linebackers have been carrying you all season and called out Nick Bosa.
*  I saw Bosa got mad, right?
*  And that wasn't like Bosa being like busting chops elbow.
*  He did not like it and did not like that.
*  He went and had three and a half sacks and Eric Armstead just sucking up offensive linemen while
*  Bosa was running free.
*  They are so good on defense and so good upfront that they're going to be able to be competitive
*  with anyone.
*  And I look at the Eagles.
*  They certainly, Tuo was seeing some ghosts last week.
*  Now, Grani was missing his tackles, but I went back and I watched some of the,
*  because I watched it live, but then I went back and I watched some of it again.
*  And there was some happy feet stuff going on by second half with him.
*  It was like, holy shit, what's going on here?
*  I'd love for you to go on Twitter, which is often a hellscape, but go on Twitter and look
*  at that moment where Tuo starts the game with the Trent Sherfield touchdown.
*  The amount of people being like MVP, MVP, MVP.
*  I work on a daily show.
*  The balloon on the Tuo thing has kind of been deflated.
*  And Joe Burrow kind of took it.
*  He's like, hey, I'll take that.
*  Thanks.
*  Tuo's prime time this weekend against the Chargers.
*  Everyone's going to be watching.
*  And then Tuo is on a Saturday night game against the Bills the following week.
*  So I think the Tuo, we're all going to be watching Tuo.
*  And we've already saw him last week watching for the next two weeks.
*  He can silence a lot of doubters or he can prove a lot of doubters wrong or right.
*  I'll give him benefit of not having his tackles.
*  That's the wrong thing.
*  And not every tackles game.
*  One last thing on the Broncos.
*  I mean, on the Niners.
*  And I say this out of respect to Kyle Shanahan.
*  Is there another coach in the league who would enjoy trying to win a Super Bowl more with Brock Purdy?
*  Like, is there another coach in the league who can figure out how to use a mediocre to worst quarterback in the right ways with the offense they have and what they're trying to do?
*  Like all this dagger has to do.
*  Just throw some quick bubble screens, throw some screens, just have poise.
*  Don't get rid of it.
*  I don't help ask them to make what two throws a game that actually are hard throws.
*  Other than that, everything is going to be designed, scripted, thought out, and he'll just put this guy in a position to succeed.
*  Deep down, I think he's probably like, hmm, I kind of like this.
*  He'll never admit it.
*  It's a challenge.
*  I mean, we go back to Greek mythology.
*  The word is hubris.
*  A little bit of like this, like, you know what?
*  I'm pretty good at what I do.
*  And I don't think he's got that because that's like a false sense of arrogance.
*  But I think there is a bit of, hey, this is a challenge and I'm up for it.
*  And if I go through Kyle's career, like, you know, Matt Schaub was a good quarterback coming out of Virginia.
*  I think Matt Schaub was awesome with Kyle in Houston.
*  And like they got the very most out of him.
*  And I remember when Kyle got the job in San Francisco, that was the Mahomes to Sean Watson, Mitch Trubisky draft.
*  And they traded out of the second pick and they took Solomon Thomas and then they would take the linebacker Ruben Foster later on.
*  And, you know, no one really quite like, all right, I'll build it.
*  And they rolled out Brian Hoyer.
*  And they rolled out Brian Hoyer week one as their starting quarterback.
*  And in Kyle's head, it was like we could be competitive with Brian Hoyer as our starter.
*  We don't need a young guy.
*  Like, we'll be all right.
*  But then they traded for Jimmy and then they went and they traded all those picks for Trey Lance.
*  I still think he's chasing that, like the dream Kyle Shanahan quarterback when at the bottom line is his offense is good enough.
*  Their blocking is good enough.
*  And the running game with McCaffrey now.
*  I would say McCaffrey is more the dream Shanahan person than any quarterback, right?
*  Him and Debo together, you know, using them the way they do.
*  The way he's fallen in with that team is predictable, but it's still kind of amazing to watch.
*  Honestly, it looks like he got dropped out of the sky for them.
*  Looks great in the uniform.
*  I think he deserves.
*  How about when they run those little wheel routes with them?
*  It's like, who's better at this specific thing than him?
*  It's funny.
*  The NFL does their Pro Bowl games voting and, you know, the votes come out and it's like the results and it's all fans.
*  So it's whatever.
*  And, you know, Christian McCaffrey is number four.
*  And I'm thinking to myself, you know, I love Josh Jacobs.
*  I love Derek Henry.
*  I was like, well, Christian McCaffrey is done to be traded in the mid season.
*  Be like, get, pick up an offense, find myself involved.
*  Yeah, Swiss Army Knife.
*  It's pretty incredible what he's done on an individual level.
*  And I think they're using him great.
*  And he's only going to get his workload increased, especially now with Mitchell out.
*  I really like the Niners.
*  And I think you're right.
*  This is a weird year for the NFC.
*  It's the Eagles who are looking amazing, but they haven't been there with Hertz yet in those big games where they've won.
*  The Cowboys who have not won a big game in decades.
*  And then, of course, I have the Manachlo.
*  I don't trust the Cowboys.
*  San Francisco's plus 450 on Fandle.
*  Minnesota, who you're about to talk about, is plus 650.
*  Can we do quick Vikings just overall?
*  Let's do that after the break.
*  Last point, because we're going to take a break.
*  Yeah, we were kind of down on the quality of the teams this season.
*  Right.
*  It was like, what a weird season.
*  Don't know what to make of it.
*  There's no stability.
*  And now it's like, man, if we got Kansas City, Cincinnati, and then Philly, San Francisco as our two conference title games, those games are fucking awesome.
*  Cincy Casey is like the number one, sign me up for that game game.
*  Now, I think that's supplanted Buffalo Casey for me, especially because Buffalo's Luzon Von Miller.
*  Some injuries in the secondary.
*  We don't know what's wrong with Josh.
*  I think Cincinnati is a safer bet to have an awesome game against Kansas City.
*  Now, we'll see.
*  Buffalo could prove me wrong in the next two weeks.
*  But those four teams plus Buffalo is the wild card.
*  Those are five really good teams that I think would be all be fun in the Super Bowl.
*  Right.
*  Let me tell you, we had Thanksgiving Day, which was like three really good matchups.
*  And we teams kind of figured themselves out.
*  Forty two million people watched the Giants and the Cowboys.
*  On Christmas Eve, the Eagles play the Cowboys, which might decide the NFC East.
*  Holy shit.
*  That's going to be a massive number.
*  And then a crazy like stroke of good luck for the Monday night football folks.
*  And I know Disney and ESPN are on far better place with the NFL than they might have been a
*  decade ago when they're getting a game like this.
*  Buffalo Cincinnati on a Monday night game, January 2nd.
*  So like we have two monster regular season games.
*  By the way, that could be for two seed.
*  Yeah, for everything.
*  It's great.
*  So like before we get to the playoffs, we still have those two massive regular season
*  games.
*  And that's not even including the week 18 slate, which is all the divisional battles
*  that could be up for grabs in a lot of ways.
