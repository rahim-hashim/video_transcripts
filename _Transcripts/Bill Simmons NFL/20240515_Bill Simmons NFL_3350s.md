# NFL Schedule Release Rant and Favorite O/U Win Totals | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [May 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToSJgXvwPQ0)
*  Michael Lombardi is here.
*  The schedule releases this week and I'm just going to do my schedule
*  release rant for you, Lombardi.
*  First of all, good to see you.
*  I'm glad you're here.
*  Nice to see you too.
*  Thank you.
*  Yeah.
*  Appreciate it.
*  After me.
*  Nice seeing you after the, you let me rant about the 76ers.
*  I'm over that.
*  I'm moving on to the next thing.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, we're going to talk 76ers to the tail end.
*  Uh, so the schedule release comes out, everyone gets so excited about it.
*  They blow it out.
*  There's shows, they leak out games.
*  I'm in the camp.
*  I just don't care.
*  And I actually feel like from an overunder standpoint, this is probably
*  the last day to get numbers at a realistic price, because once the schedule comes out,
*  everybody goes nuts, like, oh my God, they have three road games on a row.
*  Oh, they have the least rest and the stuff goes haywire.
*  So I feel like there's 24 hours here for us to really talk about the
*  teams for the schedule stuff.
*  Makes it crazy, but do you like the schedule release?
*  Do you care?
*  I look at it.
*  I look at it completely different.
*  I think it's ridiculous to evaluate the overall schedule based on
*  win percentage of last year.
*  I think it's a waste of time because their teams are all different.
*  A B the new coaches coming in that changes.
*  And what happens if you play the jets and 22 seconds into the first game,
*  the quarterback gets hurt and you had that as a hard game and now it's not a hard game.
*  Right.
*  So how do you really plan for that?
*  But I think there are some things we can get from it.
*  Number one, I think anytime you play a team that you don't know, and you don't
*  prepare for it in the off season, for example, if you're an AFC East team and
*  you have to play an NFC South team who you haven't played for four years, and
*  you've gone through a bunch of coaching changes and all that, you have to prepare
*  for that team in February, in the off season and do a deep dive on it.
*  And what complicates that is if they have a new coaching staff.
*  So Seattle new coaching staff plays, they'll play somebody that they haven't
*  known, and if you don't prepare for that through training camp, through the OTA
*  days, all that, you can get caught off guard.
*  I think you look for that.
*  Second, you have to look at who they play before a short week.
*  So we know Buffalo is playing Miami on the first Amazon game.
*  So who does Buffalo open up with?
*  If they open up with a Pittsburgh or a physical team, that short week hurts
*  you, no matter whether it's early in the season or not.
*  Because your pad level is not going to be perfect.
*  Your fundamentals aren't great.
*  You didn't take training camp seriously.
*  So I think there's some of that.
*  And then cold weather teams in the heat in September.
*  Buffalo plays Miami, but the sun will be down.
*  It'll be cooler.
*  It's going to be humid as shit, but at least that gives them an advantage as
*  opposed to playing them at one o'clock on a Sunday afternoon in Miami, where it's
*  90 degrees with a hundred percent humidity.
*  So weather and scheduling, that's what I look at in terms of the whole thing.
*  I think it's both.
*  Well, conversely on the weather thing, the warm weather teams late in the season,
*  if like Miami is playing at Buffalo on week 18, it's like, all right, that's not
*  nothing, but I think it's probably the big picture of the schedule might be
*  worth one win or one loss either way, depending on what you thought heading
*  into the year, I still feel like there's an incredible amount of value now since
*  the over-under came out.
*  Some of them got bumped up by a win here when there we've had the draft.
*  We've had free agency.
*  I separated all my cat.
*  I have four categories for you.
*  And I'm just going to read you the four categories.
*  These are red flag numbers that I there's six teams where I was like, man,
*  why is the over-under there?
*  I don't get it.
*  So I'm going to read you the six teams that I wrote down and you tell me if
*  you had any of the six.
*  Cleveland over eight and a half.
*  They were 11 and six last year.
*  Uh, Denver's five and a half.
*  They're eight and nine last year.
*  Detroit is 10 and a half.
*  They're 12 and five last year.
*  The charges are eight and a half.
*  They were five and 12 last year.
*  Pittsburgh seven and a half.
*  They were 10 and seven last year.
*  And they win 10 games every year, no matter who the hell's in the team.
*  And Seattle with a new coach, the over-under is seven and a half.
*  There were nine and eight last year.
*  So Cleveland, Denver, Detroit chargers, Pittsburgh, Seattle.
*  Out of those six, which one jumped out of you?
*  Seattle at seven and a half is a no brainer.
*  Okay.
*  And let me tell you why.
*  So Seattle has been 20 and 13 at home over the last two seasons.
*  So they really haven't had a home field advantage.
*  And why is that?
*  Because their defense has sucked.
*  Okay.
*  They can't stop the run.
*  They gave up 400 yards to Pittsburgh with Mason Rudolph under center,
*  30 points to Pittsburgh in week 17.
*  Their defense couldn't get it fixed.
*  You know, Clint, I think it was Clint Hurdle.
*  I forget, I forget his name.
*  He's a D line coach.
*  He's now in Philly.
*  He wasn't the answer at the coordinator.
*  So he said problems with that defense.
*  McDonald's going to fix it.
*  I think Seattle underachieved defensively.
*  I think when you look at them, they have three corners that can cover.
*  They're good at safety.
*  Their front got better with Murphy.
*  They have Daquan Jones from last year at Denver.
*  They're going to be a much improved team and he's a really good coach.
*  Remember now this guy took Kyle Van Noy and he took clowny off the street,
*  basically, and turned it into 18 and a half sacks.
*  Okay.
*  Now they would say there were still great players.
*  I'm going to say that he helped them.
*  Well, and some, and some D back injuries too, that they always seem to
*  survive somehow when you're, I was like, oh man, they're done.
*  They'll grab somebody off the waiver.
*  Why are all of a sudden that guy's starting?
*  Well, the most amazing thing about Baltimore last year is they had the lead.
*  They were plus 42 and first half point differential and the opponents only
*  were the rank last in the league and pass the attempts against them.
*  And why it makes no sense at all.
*  And the reason they did that is because people were really worried about blitz
*  and facing the throw in it because he had so many blitzes from different
*  combinations to create turns.
*  I think he's going to be a huge help.
*  They get their two tackles back who were hurt most of last year, cross and Lucas.
*  That's going to help.
*  They had two really good running backs.
*  This is a good team.
*  They won nine games with the worst defensive football, right?
*  And they should have beaten Seattle and they're going to get a home field.
*  So to go over seven and a half, I like that.
*  I love,
*  can you hold on on one thing on Seattle, um, division, fair to say, not as good
*  as last year, Arizona would be a little better Rams are going to be about the
*  same, but the Rams don't have Aaron Donald.
*  I refuse to believe that's not going to matter.
*  And the Niners feel like, you know, maybe they can scratch one more year out of
*  this, but the caps about to get them in a real way.
*  Well, the other thing about the Rams is you have to always worry whether
*  Stafford could stay healthy.
*  And so, you know, when you have the Rams on your schedule, if he's on the team,
*  like when we, when he got hurt Dallas, the next week when they started Brett
*  Ripon and you know, they were easy games for you.
*  Uh, look, every, I think, I think Arizona, can they be better?
*  I mean, look, Kyle and Murray wasn't good last year.
*  Like, I know he's coming off the knee, but he hasn't been good for two years.
*  He's been under seven yards per attempt.
*  He has this mythology about them, but once you rush him the right way, he can't.
*  So I think Seattle's good.
*  I think Pittsburgh, you can't ignore Pittsburgh, but they've improved
*  defensively, they got a linebacker in the draft, Peyton Wilson who can play.
*  They've been looking to replace Ryan Shazer for, since he got hurt, right?
*  They have him and Queen, they signed those guys.
*  They've improved their offensive line.
*  You know, they've got good receivers.
*  I look, I don't love Russell Wilson, but I think eight wins isn't a hard
*  thing for Mike Tomlin to achieve.
*  I think Jim Harbaugh makes chargers instantly better.
*  I, uh, on the Steelers quick, I don't know if Russell Wilson is even a C- at this
*  point, but their quarterbacks last year were lower than a C- so if he can even
*  be competent, that's fine.
*  Arthur Smith gets his bad rap for being a head coach and I'm sure Super Bowl
*  winning GM Terry Fontenot thinks that it was all Arthur Smith's fault, right?
*  You know, but Arthur Smith can run the ball.
*  He's a really good offensive coordinator and they're going to run the ball.
*  Like Russell, they're going to, he's going to hand it off and they've got weapons
*  and pickings, they'll be better.
*  They'll be better coach too.
*  By the way, I don't love Arthur Smith, but was it his fault that Desmond
*  Ritter threw like 13 of the worst passes of the entire season last year?
*  I can't totally blame him on that.
*  I mean, his name wasn't on the document that was released saying that they weren't
*  interested in Lamar Jackson.
*  I mean, like who wrote that?
*  Did that document just come out of flowery branch from the Super Bowl
*  winning general manager and Kaiser Sosei McKay?
*  I mean, like who did that come from?
*  Like, you know, they, you know, they all hide behind somebody.
*  Yeah.
*  Arthur Smith gets blamed for everything.
*  I mean, they've passed up two great defensive linemen and Jalen Carter and
*  Murphy to draft a running back and a quarterback, and they had a running back
*  at Algier who averaged five yards a carrot, but that's a horse of another color.
*  I think the other thing when you're looking at these over-under totals is you
*  really, like when Jim Schwartz went to Cleveland last year, we said Cleveland
*  was going to be better because of Schwartz.
*  And I think you got to give coaching in the NFL a lot of props because the
*  coaches can really enhance the win total.
*  I think the charges are going to be tougher.
*  They're going to win more close games.
*  Herbert's going to be throwing less and more effective.
*  I don't want to hear this bullshit.
*  Well, they're, they don't have receivers.
*  Okay.
*  Well, Mahomes didn't have receivers either.
*  He doesn't have receivers now.
*  Once for she rice gets suspended, who's his receivers, Hollywood Brown, you
*  know, the worthy kid, but Kaderius Tony who doesn't even play.
*  So I think to me just on mental and physical, I mean, the
*  chargers will be like the Knicks.
*  They're going to be hard to play.
*  Well, Vegas agrees with you because they went five and 12 last year.
*  And Vegas is basically saying, if you want the over, they're going to have
*  to go nine and eight for you to win that.
*  And they've lost some dudes, you know?
*  So this is because, you know, I, nobody believes in the new coach theory more
*  than me, especially when you're replacing a bad coach, there's no better bet.
*  Brandon Staley was terrible.
*  So if you're putting a really competent person replacing Brandon Staley with
*  somebody who can change your culture in one year, we saw it with, you know,
*  Peyton and Denver last year, what did Denver finish?
*  They were, uh, they once, what they won seven, eight, nine last year.
*  And he hated his quarterback to the point that he basically shut them down
*  and gave up 70 points in one game.
*  Right.
*  It bounced back from that.
*  I just worry about with the chargers, lack of, uh, explosiveness on offense.
*  I know what he's going to do.
*  I know he's going to just try to ground and pound low scoring games and all that.
*  But the conference, the AFC is just better than the NFC this year.
*  If you, if you just list like all the AFC teams versus the NFC teams, it's tilted.
*  It's, I would say two thirds of the teams I like are in the AFC this year.
*  I think there are no questions.
*  And look, I'm not saying the charge is going to win the Superbowl.
*  They're going to win close games.
*  You know, I, I, I, I think Detroit, we talk about them.
*  It, you know, they paid all their guys, which was great.
*  I mean, golf's the second highest paid quarterback.
*  It's amazing.
*  Right.
*  I, I, what were the odds of that?
*  Uh, would you have said Ben Simmons versus Jared Goff in 2021?
*  One of these guys will get another max deal.
*  That would have been a tough battle with golf because at least
*  golf will throw the ball.
*  Ben won't shoot, you know, but he looked nice in that picture.
*  You sent me a, whenever he was going, I know every once in a while I torch a
*  Lombardi and somebody sent me the Ben Simmons at the Met gal.
*  And I was like, when do I want to ruin Lombardi's day?
*  I even looked at the time of the day.
*  I'm like, Oh, this is right before dinner.
*  This will really, really get him.
*  If Ben Simmons were in a fancy outfit.
*  Oh God, it's just so bad.
*  Uh, you know, like I think Detroit's going to be better, but
*  Detroit's going to be a target.
*  You know, I was talking to a coach the other day in the league.
*  And he has a really good relationship with Sean McVay and they were having a
*  conversation after the Rams won the Superbowl and this guy said to Sean, he
*  said, Sean, this will be the hardest year of your life.
*  And McVay was like, what are you talking about?
*  He said, like what?
*  No.
*  He said, no, it's going to be the hardest because you're going to be the hunted one.
*  You got the bullseye and you got the bullseye and everybody's studying your shit.
*  Everybody's looking at your stuff.
*  Everybody's breaking you down.
*  I have a sense that's Detroit too.
*  Now the one thing about golf, why he was successful is it goes back to the
*  belief of a team, if the quarterback is protected, like golf is with that good
*  offensive line, he can look really good.
*  He looked good for the Rams when he was protected.
*  He fell apart when the Rams fell apart when, you know, he didn't have the protection.
*  So, um, you know, I think Detroit should win 11.
*  I'm not in love with that as much, but what I am in love with is Denver.
*  They went 12 and five last year.
*  So if you're going to lose that bet, there can be two losses worse, but people,
*  they're going to be like the trendy Superbowl pick too.
*  What you said about golf, maybe think of something.
*  When, when people do this with quarterbacks, cause this is a Mac Jones defense.
*  Well, if you know, if he had a really good offensive line and he had time and it's
*  like, what quarterback couldn't you say that about everybody?
*  Yeah.
*  It's like the Bronnie James thing right now.
*  We're like, you know, if you put Bronnie with great teammates, you know,
*  he's really going to thrive.
*  That's he loves.
*  If he's with a good team, he'll be better.
*  It's like, well, as opposed to the other players, you couldn't say that about.
*  Don't get me started on that one.
*  That was just, is there a quarterback is like, ah, his offensive line had been
*  worse.
*  Maybe he could have taken off.
*  How about Caleb Williams?
*  That, you know, how many, I mean, unless the defense counts the five Mississippi
*  house, Caleb Williams, he doesn't have a left tackle.
*  The right tackles a second year player who wasn't good.
*  They weren't good up front last year.
*  So I don't care how many skill guys you have.
*  If the quarterbacks see the Detroit was smart, they protected golf.
*  If you don't protect golf, golf's going to fall apart.
*  You know that we've seen it.
*  He's not, I don't want to say he's not tough, but he's not resiliently tough.
*  You can, you can rattle him and speed him up, but this is basically what the Rams
*  did with Stafford, right?
*  They were like, we actually want to get Stafford through a five month season.
*  So he invested in the offensive line and just trying to be able to block for him
*  so he can make it.
*  Right.
*  So I mean, look, I think Detroit's better defensively.
*  There's no question, but I think rebate is good too.
*  And I think there'll be a target now.
*  Was Chicago better?
*  Yeah.
*  I think Chicago is better.
*  You know, is Minnesota better?
*  I don't know, but I'm iffy on that one.
*  The one I like a lot is Denver because I just listened to what Sean Payton said
*  at after his, when they asked him his initial reaction to Bo Nix and he was
*  glowing, but forget what he said.
*  His face was glowing.
*  Like, and so what happens so often when you're in the league is when you go out
*  to rookie camp, what you want to see is a symmetrical version of your rookie draft
*  class. You want to see the first round pick look really good, better than anybody.
*  And you want to see the seventh round pick being the worst player.
*  Right.
*  And you want to see that symmetry.
*  You don't want to go out there and say, Oh, fuck the fourth round.
*  There's better than the first round.
*  What do we do here?
*  Right.
*  You know, and we've all had that happen to us.
*  So, you know, he came into that press conference and yep, what I thought of
*  Bo Nix, what I believed in Bo Nix before the start of the season, before the draft,
*  I see it, it's there.
*  I'm good.
*  And he won eight games or next year.
*  Now he didn't beat the Raiders in those eight wins.
*  Think about that.
*  He had eight wins and lost both games to the Raiders.
*  He lost the opener by a point and he lost another one to him.
*  So, and I don't think the Raiders are going to be very good.
*  So there you go.
*  I think five and a half.
*  I think that's a gimme.
*  I can't imagine Sean not winning more games than that.
*  I just can't.
*  And it's minus 150 on Fandl right now, but they were eight and nine last year.
*  With a really weird quarterback situation.
*  The only reason I can think that the over-under would be that low is that just
*  they're paying so much money to Wilson, that dead cap hit, it's almost a historic
*  level of a captain that maybe they're factoring that in, but I just don't see
*  Champagne going five and 12, especially, uh, not, not with his team.
*  Plus he's added to his defense.
*  They gave up 70 points.
*  Once they fixed the defense last year, they actually played pretty good.
*  I mean, they go into Buffalo and beat Buffalo.
*  Right.
*  You know, I mean, they've won game.
*  He knows how to manage a game.
*  Don't underestimate that.
*  How to play the game.
*  He may not have the best team, but he knows how to play the best on a certain day.
*  So, and then the last one I had was, oh yeah, Cleveland, cause Cleveland was
*  11 and six last year and the over is eight and a half, which is just spooky
*  because they had a pretty weird quarterback situation last year that
*  allegedly is resolved.
*  So now we've got a new system, right?
*  New quarterbacks coach, new whole offensive system.
*  Uh, you know, I don't trust the quarterback.
*  I like their defense, but they had no draft picks.
*  They've done things in free agency.
*  I think they can get to nine.
*  I think since he's going to be much better, I think Pittsburgh's better.
*  So I think the division is going to make it harder there.
*  I would say if I get an order, I would go Seattle, Pittsburgh, Denver,
*  Chargers, Detroit, Cleveland.
*  Cause the other thing with Cleveland is Chubb.
*  Oh, oh, he's in summer.
*  Oh, he looked good today, but I, do you come back from that knee injury
*  and when you're probably not, and then Watson.
*  Plus they lose Bill Callahan, the line coach.
*  Yeah.
*  Don't think that doesn't affect the team.
*  Right?
*  I mean, it would be like the Eagles losing their line coach.
*  That guy makes that thing go really that well.
*  And so, you know, they let him go to go work with his son, which I get that
*  completely, but I think to me that that's a challenge.
*  I think that that order, I, I, I'm probably the only guy high on.
*  And when we talked about Seattle, we didn't talk about Sam Howe or Gino Smith.
*  Look, they have weapons on that team.
*  They're I mean, and Jigba in the slot, you know, Metcalf, Lockett, they're good.
*  Right.
*  So, and Gino two years ago was good, but last year got the shit beat out of him.
*  I think Seattle is my favorite of those six.
*  Just the, the, I don't understand why the number is the number teams.
*  Cause I have other ones that I really like, but I think Seattle, I like McDonald's
*  and Pete Carroll had an unbelievable career, but that team, there was some sloppy
*  weirdness with them the last couple of years.
*  It wasn't much different than the Pats, but I think the Pats, the defense and
*  the infrastructure of the, of what they were doing, they were still in the games.
*  They just had one of the worst offense skill position, you know, and a lot of
*  that was self-inflicted from Belichick and some of the people he drafted, but
*  they couldn't score points and then their kicker couldn't make kicks.
*  But like what you're talking about with New England, I mean, when you have a
*  winning program, you lose staff guys.
*  And I think Pete's staff wasn't at the highest level at the end, neither was
*  Bill's and I think that affects you.
*  I think that's hard to overcome.
*  And I think McDonald will give them a breath of fresh air and I think it'll
*  give us plus if you're betting the over here, you're saying that home field
*  matters and I, and I've been in that stadium and it should be hard to run the
*  ball in Seattle because it's so hard to hear.
*  I'm going to give you another category.
*  And this is based off something you did on your podcast recently.
*  You asked, you asked Femi, Femi's married now still has he finished
*  his Sopranos what's the deal with Femi?
*  He's done.
*  He's got it through.
*  Yeah.
*  He's going through it.
*  I don't feel like his heart was totally in it.
*  I feel like he did it just for you.
*  Um, I have two teams for you.
*  The question you asked was, Hey, we're going to have five terrible teams every
*  year.
*  This is how the league works.
*  Everybody loves their team and in May and June, but we know how it's going to go.
*  There's going to be five shady teams.
*  There's going to be a team that goes two and 15.
*  There'll be a team that goes four and 13, then that's good three.
*  So who are the five worst teams?
*  The two teams that I think I feel the best about sucking.
*  Are obviously Carolina and our guy Tepper.
*  They went two and 15 last year.
*  The over under for them is five and a half.
*  I can't imagine what on earth would make anybody go up Carolina six plus wins.
*  I'm in here's my money.
*  Um, and then Vegas under six and a half.
*  That's plus one 18.
*  There's been a little Vegas buzz.
*  I don't understand it.
*  Like the damage of those Gruden drafts, which a lot of people have written about,
*  and it is one of when then you throw in rugs, which, you know, I guess Gruden gets
*  some blame on that because you're taking, you're rolling the dice on somebody
*  that's got some character issues and then he has the worst character thing possible
*  happen.
*  But when you miss that many drafts and you just have this chasm for years, and
*  then this year you go into the draft and it's like, all right, we're going to fix
*  it.
*  We have a high pick.
*  Let's take another tight end.
*  So now they've spent their second round pick a year ago and their first round pick
*  this year on two tight ends.
*  And then the press conference after they're like, no, no, it's good.
*  They can play together.
*  And it's like, this is, you might as well have Julio Okafor and Joel Embiid and
*  back to back picks.
*  Like we've seen this.
*  You can play together, but you have holes all over your team.
*  You're the last team that should have two tight ends.
*  And combined with the Antonio Pierce, who the players are like, we love this guy.
*  Let's say I have no idea if he's a good coach to me that they have a little stink
*  to them.
*  And then Carolina is obvious, but are those the two best bets to you to have a
*  bad season?
*  Or is there anyone else you'd pick?
*  I put the Giants in there too.
*  I mean, how can the, I mean, why are the Giants going to be good?
*  Well, Danny Dimes coming off ACL surgery.
*  And then, and then Drew Locks backing them up.
*  You don't like that?
*  I didn't, you know, I know they were trying to draft.
*  I know that I completely buy that they were trying to draft all.
*  I didn't know that.
*  I completely buy that they were trying to draft all that.
*  I completely buy it.
*  They got me, you know, they have me hook line and sinker on that.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Look, I mean, why are they good?
*  Tell me that their offensive line still isn't very good.
*  They draft a receiver who's really good.
*  Can they get them the ball?
*  Danny Dimes has an average over seven yards per attempt at his career.
*  Can they protect them?
*  And how good are they on defense?
*  Cause they sign Brian Burns.
*  He was on one of the worst teams in the league last year.
*  Like he's not making them any better.
*  So I don't know.
*  The giants to me, I think what's their identity because so basically they're
*  going to say we have an awesome pass rush.
*  We're trying to build our team.
*  Like it's the Oh seven giants again.
*  Cool.
*  Well, you, you have one skilled position receiver guy who's a rookie.
*  You have bottom seven, bottom eight quarterback situation in the league.
*  Maybe worse.
*  Your offensive line is probably bottom seven, bottom eight.
*  I just don't see it.
*  Uh, the only thing in your favor is that the conference isn't very good, but.
*  Yeah.
*  So if it was Vegas, Carolina and the giants, that feels like a pretty,
*  Washington passed it past the giants to me.
*  They signed a lot of guys.
*  They've improved their core base of their team.
*  Quinn will give them a one year bump.
*  They'll get some energy.
*  I mean, anybody can replace Rivera who hasn't said a word at eight years on the
*  sideline, I mean, anybody can replace that.
*  Right.
*  And then, you know, the enemy destroyed the offensive team.
*  I mean, he could have been arrested for malpractice when he did this.
*  If I was Sam Howell's dad, I would have gone and punched him the way you had
*  my kid getting killed out there.
*  So, uh,
*  the things I love about you is your love for Sam Howell that he just was in the
*  wrong system this whole time.
*  He did get the absolute shit kicked out of him and he kept coming back.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I think he was interesting.
*  I wouldn't be surprised if he had a moment for somebody at some point, but yeah,
*  they, they fit the new coach there.
*  I had Washington in a later category because they had a ton of picks, Dan Quinn,
*  so I, the Giants to me are clearly the fourth, the fourth team in that division.
*  I mean, let's go to Vegas.
*  Like, so when you, you know, I've seen this happen for when the players don't
*  like the coach and they clearly didn't like McDaniels, you know, or they weren't
*  buying into the program and then the new guy comes in, the substitute teacher
*  comes in and you get that lift, but that lift doesn't last into the next season.
*  It doesn't last into the next year.
*  It has to have its own identity.
*  And then you come out of the draft with a tight end who you have to now say
*  we're a 12 team, right?
*  You know, like, what are we doing?
*  We, we, we, where's our strength?
*  We have no offensive line.
*  Now I know they've been signing guys, you know, they signed Pete and they
*  signed a bunch of guys after the draft, but I don't like, I agree.
*  The Gruden has gotten, the Mayock got a pass on all these horrendous drafts.
*  They got a pass on.
*  And then, then Josh comes in and doubles down on bad drafts by trading for an
*  older receiver, giving up a first round pick, which is a violates all beliefs
*  that I have in terms of building teams.
*  So it hasn't been like they've, they don't have a farm system.
*  Yeah.
*  They're not talented without a farm system.
*  And then let's talk about it.
*  Gar, Garter Mentshu, he's a middle reliever, three innings, four innings,
*  maybe that once he gets to the fifth inning, you're coming out, you know,
*  that's it, we've got to get to the bullpen.
*  Is he Kelly Ubre?
*  Is Kelly Ubre better than Mentshu?
*  I think Kelly Ubre is better than him.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause Kelly Ubre can have some magical nights.
*  I don't know if Gardner can have a magical night.
*  I've always said Gardner was a poor man's Baker Mayfield.
*  Like I wanted Gardner on my team as a backup and then middle reliever, four
*  games, put them out there, but once people understand what, once people
*  understand that Gardner can't step up in the pocket, they have them.
*  So when you have two guards, the Raiders currently have three guys on their
*  roster that can only play center.
*  Parnham is a center.
*  The James kids are center, right?
*  And then they drafted the Oregon center.
*  So now they're going to put two guys that guard, they really aren't good
*  guards, they're better centers.
*  Right.
*  Like, I don't know, maybe the quarterback is just going to go to one, one center.
*  One time he's going to go to the other guard, you know, make him snap the ball.
*  So they're not good up front.
*  They're not good in the middle of the pocket.
*  And let's be clear here.
*  Like I know Adams has got this great, he's not the same player he once was either.
*  He wasn't, he wasn't open in the same ways.
*  I always judged the best receivers by.
*  Are you when the TV cuts to where the ball's going, the guy, nobody is near
*  anybody like Devante Parker was the opposite of this every time they cut to
*  Parker, he was basically carrying two guys on his back because he couldn't
*  even get open by an inch.
*  And it felt like Adams that agreed difficulty of his catches, you know, and
*  I know he's a physical receiver and he's good and he's good in spail, but all
*  that, it just never felt like he was that open.
*  And you mentioned Minshew, like, you know, was there a better situation for him
*  than last year and unbelievable offensive coach, they could block for him.
*  You know, he's playing in a goofy division in a dome and not now he's like going to
*  Vegas, he's got this weird team with two tight ends and they can't block.
*  And I don't know.
*  I know.
*  I don't, I don't think that should have been adjusted fields team with a, with a
*  coach that, but they can't hire, they couldn't go, get see the hair and him as
*  the office coordinator.
*  Yeah.
*  All right.
*  So that, that eliminated fields.
*  So, you know, and I mean, Carolina, look, I don't, I mean, Carolina has to be
*  better because they'll be professionally connected no matter how bad can Alice
*  is or how good he is, he's got to be better.
*  I mean, I said this last year, I did a radio show in Carolina in August.
*  Promoting football done right.
*  And I said, that is a disaster waiting to happen.
*  That was as poorly coached team as I've ever seen.
*  And the guy said, you just have a, must have a hard on for Carolina.
*  I said, no, I'm just like, this is what you see.
*  It's gotta be an upstick.
*  Now does that uptick mean four?
*  Does that mean five?
*  I don't know.
*  The South isn't very good, even though that Superbowl franchise Falcons is
*  probably going to win 14 games, but I don't know, you know, who, who, who's good
*  in that division.
*  Frank wrecked it.
*  Amante Williams on the Panthers.
*  He was like, nah, I don't know if I want to coach again.
*  They're like, what about if we offer do this?
*  And he's like, all right, I guess I'll do it.
*  And just an all time mail in by him.
*  Um, so Vegas, Carolina, the giants before we take a break, is there one other team
*  you would throw if that's the bot, if let's say, let's create a bottom for
*  Vegas, Carolina giants.
*  Is there a fourth team you feel like could linger in that?
*  Vicinity.
*  Well, I mean, usually that fourth team is a team that, or a team that, you know,
*  gets a quarterback injured.
*  That isn't very good.
*  I mean, I think New England's going to be better, but certainly if, if they have
*  to play may all year, where are they?
*  There's a change in coaches there.
*  Again, now you're bringing in a coach who, you know, once, you know, we've got a
*  basketball, the whole tenors changed.
*  Right.
*  And, and everybody's going to celebrate that, but I've lived this before, right?
*  I've lived it.
*  It doesn't work.
*  It just doesn't work.
*  Uh, could they get the five wins?
*  Look, if they have a better field goal kicker, they would have had seven wins
*  last year as bad as they were.
*  So I think they would be another team.
*  You have to think about putting in here.
*  I think their team is better though.
*  Their defense, if they're healthy, their defense was better.
*  But again, he's, he's not in the building to coach the defense.
*  Right.
*  All right.
*  Lombardi, my five favorite overs and Arizona is one of them.
*  I would love for you to talk me out of it because everybody is on Arizona and it
*  seems too obvious and, um, Arizona over six and a half is one juice on that is
*  already minus one 60 Green Bay over nine and a half is my second favorite or not.
*  My side.
*  This isn't an order.
*  This is alphabetical.
*  Uh, Green Bay over nine and a half.
*  I just, I really liked that team.
*  I thought they could have won in San Francisco.
*  Uh, I like how they built the team.
*  I have no idea why they would go backwards.
*  I know, uh, your buddy, big daddy is probably coming up with a million reasons
*  why they're going to go eight, nine, but I'm a believer, um, Houston at over
*  nine and a half, the only thing that scares me isn't super obvious.
*  I didn't like that the line jumped by a win when they made the digs trade.
*  Cause I'm not positive how impactful digs is going to be, but he moved the line
*  from eight and a half to nine and a half.
*  And there's juice on that.
*  And then the two wonders, these are my favorites, Dallas under 10 and a half,
*  which I think you agree with.
*  I just don't, we'll talk about them.
*  And then your guy fought.
*  No, uh, Atlanta nine and a half is there over under there were seven and 10 last
*  year, so the case would be that Kirk cousins is going to be worth three wins.
*  Fine.
*  They threw away their first round pick that the eighth pick in the draft.
*  They didn't use, they use it on a backup.
*  The guy's not going to play.
*  Their defense wasn't good last year.
*  They didn't do anything about that.
*  I don't understand why they're a 10 win team.
*  So let's start with them.
*  What, what makes people think Atlanta is going to go 10 and seven cousins coming
*  off a torn Achilles, by the way, which with him and Rogers, it feels like people
*  have just been skimping past that part.
*  Like, Oh yeah, that'd be fine at the torn Achilles.
*  They'll just heal it.
*  Like, I don't know quarterbacks, their legs, guys diving around their legs,
*  guys falling around their legs.
*  It's not like basketball where you can just come back.
*  So Atlanta under for me, where do you have it?
*  Oh, I have them under not because of, you know, anything other than the fact that
*  whenever a team, and I wrote about this in football done right.
*  Whenever a team thinks they're one player away, they never are.
*  Right.
*  When you, the Herschel Walker trade, we're one player away.
*  You know, the green Bay Packers let's trade for John Hado.
*  We're one player away.
*  You never one player away.
*  And so Atlanta last year was one of the worst.
*  They've been one of the worst pass rushing teams in the last three seasons.
*  They play in a dome.
*  They don't get very many people come to the dome, but they play in there and it can get loud there.
*  And so you would think they would have the ability to create turnovers with crowd noise,
*  but they can't because they can't rush.
*  They were 29th and creating turnovers last year.
*  Right.
*  And if you don't, if you think they have an elite defense, Baker Mayfield, a game in
*  Atlanta is down by four.
*  He takes the team down the field and scores a touchdown late in the season when the, when the
*  playoffs are still in balance.
*  Okay.
*  So like, I think they've completely, and I don't trust Super Bowl winning GM
*  Fontenot to evaluate the team correctly, clearly.
*  So you're not getting me.
*  Plus can cousins move?
*  How good is Atlanta's offensive line?
*  Oh, if we get Pitts to play better.
*  Well, Pitts hasn't played better yet.
*  Pitts is not, Pitts is a player who, as you know, in the NBA, if, if, if there's not a
*  creative advantage by moving them to Pittsburgh, they're going to be a very, very
*  good player.
*  If they're moving to position, he gets no advantage.
*  So when he's out there, people treat him like a wide receiver.
*  Even though he's six, he's a big man.
*  He's a receiver.
*  He's not a tight end.
*  So you're not worried about a weak side run game with him.
*  So you can't, you're limited in what you can do.
*  What NBA player is Pitts?
*  Well, it would be, you know, like what you want is you want like when Scottie Pippen and
*  Jordan, they could interchange all their positions, like one minute he's this, one
*  minute he's that.
*  He hasn't been an elite pass catcher.
*  He kind of is a galloper.
*  He's, you know, he, he'll make a play to make the highlights.
*  Try to think of an NBA player who's like him.
*  He's probably like Tobias Harris.
*  That's what he's like.
*  Oh no, Tobias, poor Tobias.
*  He's like, pay really well, but you're not getting a return on the dollar.
*  Well, especially fantasy where he was getting drafted for multiple years with Kelsey.
*  He's getting the same numbers.
*  And I.
*  But because people don't understand Kelsey.
*  Kelsey is an elite wide receiver.
*  He's an elite.
*  He's not a tight end.
*  He's an elite wide receiver.
*  Yeah.
*  He's always been a wide receiver credit.
*  Kelsey for not taking wide receiver money.
*  Right.
*  He could have easily demanded.
*  Kelsey was also a third round pick.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  And Kyle Pitts went fifth in the draft.
*  So the way they built their team is just completely logical to me.
*  And you saw it this year with the draft, right?
*  What happened with the draft this year versus, uh, other years, right?
*  Where it was just, everybody loaded up on offensive line quarterbacks, and then
*  the couple of the awesome receivers.
*  And you saw guys like Bowers who I think would have been like the third or fourth
*  or fifth pick a couple of years ago, but now people are like the tight end.
*  I don't know if that's as impactful as like getting a fucking left tackle that
*  we have for the next 10 years.
*  Right.
*  So Atlanta takes Bijam Robinson, I think eighth, they already had a receiver.
*  They take Drake London eighth.
*  He's probably, I would say one of the least talented top 10 receiver picks
*  we've had in the last, he's not, he's certainly not like a game changer.
*  And then pits you'd watch entire Falcons games.
*  Like, is he out there?
*  It's like the Tobias Harris.
*  I was like, wait, pitch just caught a four yard pass.
*  I didn't really see this playing.
*  It's like, it's a three.
*  So yikes.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, like to me, it's like you wasted all these picks.
*  You had Jalen Carter staring in the face.
*  You turn it down.
*  You had Murphy or a lot to staring in the face.
*  You turn it down.
*  Like, did they pay attention that they can't say chiefs want to suit
*  well with their defense, not with their offense.
*  Did they pay attention to that?
*  You know?
*  And so I don't see it.
*  Let me jump up to your Arizona one.
*  Like I don't trust Mary.
*  I think Drew Petsick did a really good job running the ball last year with
*  Connor.
*  You saw it from them down the stretch last year.
*  Cause they got a little frisky down the stretch.
*  I thought the tight end was really good.
*  Trey McBride.
*  I thought he was really good, but I think to me, defensively, they're going
*  to have a hard time taking a jump and I don't trust Mary.
*  I don't trust it.
*  I think people understand how to game plan against him.
*  If you look at his numbers, the last three years, they have gone straight away
*  down now you're only need the seven to cash it, but you know, I wish it was
*  a one win lower.
*  That's why I, so this is what I needed from you because if it was five and a
*  half, I'd be all in the six and a half makes me nervous.
*  Plus a shitload of juice.
*  This is like one of the hot picks in May, which I mean, I would circle that
*  and say, you know, and look, when has everybody been on it when the juice is
*  again, where you have to go with the juice?
*  When does that ever?
*  Yeah.
*  The minus one 50.
*  How about Houston?
*  Does Houston scare you at all?
*  Because everything is lining up for them as the hot, sexy, watch out for
*  them.
*  Yeah.
*  A little like the lions last year, by the way.
*  And that, and the lions actually paid off.
*  They're going to be the hunted one.
*  I don't understand how that line moved from that eight and a half to nine and
*  a half because of digs, because nobody watches football.
*  Nobody, nobody actually watched digs in the second half of the year.
*  Or how about, you know, how long do we have to listen to Odell Beckham?
*  How great he's going to be for Miami.
*  Like, are you kidding me?
*  I mean, did anybody watch Odell Beckham?
*  I mean, that was that Marvel Brock Brock Oswald was the heist.
*  That was one of the great robberies of all time.
*  No, come on.
*  Nothing's going to stop Osweiler.
*  No, but Omar didn't steal that much money in Baltimore than what Beckham stole.
*  I mean, Beckham stole way more than Omar and Marlowe combined.
*  So, but Juju Smith's just there.
*  Don't, don't, uh, don't count him out of the combo.
*  It costs them more to more to cut him than keep him.
*  Juju.
*  It's one of the rare, terrible, we can't even like get out of it contracts.
*  So you're Houston rushes the passer, very good coach, special quarterback.
*  And even if digs is their third receiver, there's that's a still really nice third
*  receiver to have, they're going to be able to run the ball.
*  What, what do I not like about that team?
*  Third line is better than Chicago's law.
*  They have a legitimate left tackle in tons.
*  So they've got to get Titus Howard to play better at right.
*  I mean, they, they got Shaq Mason.
*  They've got the guard.
*  I mean, they've got it.
*  They can play better.
*  And look, I think they've, I don't have any love for Will.
*  I don't think Tennessee is going to be with Will Levis under center.
*  I don't think that's going to be.
*  I think India will be better.
*  I don't know what to make a Jacksonville because Lawrence hasn't taken, and I'm a
*  huge Lawrence fan, so I either blew this, but if you're really honest with yourself,
*  Lawrence, then throw the ball down the field.
*  He's Daniel Jones.
*  He averages, he's never averaged over 7.2 yards per attempt down the field.
*  Well, what's scary about it is how about, how about, how about all the capital
*  they've spent on receivers for him?
*  Free agent draft picks.
*  They just did it again.
*  And they don't sign any linemen.
*  Like they think their lines good.
*  And they think it's all about the receivers.
*  I mean, they got Ingram as franchise player.
*  They paid Kirk a ton of money, right?
*  They drafted this kid from LSU Murphy, you know, like seriously.
*  And then they turn around.
*  I mean, I know they didn't, they traded for Ridley.
*  They let him go.
*  But to me, it just seems like they, I don't trust them.
*  I really don't.
*  I don't, so Jacksonville and are they good enough on defense?
*  You know?
*  No, I think the guy they hired who was in Atlanta last year, Ryan Nielsen, I think
*  he'll be a better coach than Caldwell.
*  There's no question.
*  So there's going to be that upgrade there.
*  You're going to get that.
*  I know you loved as, as a football diehard old school guy, I know you
*  loved the owner's son showing up with a neck brace to try to continue his, his
*  wrestling angle from the AEW pay-per-view a couple of days earlier.
*  I know, I know for the old school guys, they love that stuff.
*  I mean, how can they, when you talk about a franchise that's
*  unbelievably can't win.
*  I mean, you're just done.
*  It, when you're doing stuff like that, when you're supposed to be a serious
*  professional football franchise, I can't take you seriously.
*  I just can't.
*  So bad.
*  All right.
*  Let's talk Green Bay.
*  Green Bay.
*  I like, okay.
*  Here's what I like.
*  Green Bay.
*  Cause I think Green Bay is good.
*  I don't love LaFleur, but I think he did a good job with love in the
*  second half of the season.
*  The first half of the year is protecting them.
*  But I think the addition of the new defensive coordinator, HaFleur,
*  is going to make a huge difference.
*  I think that was a good hire.
*  HaFleur was the offensive, was the head coach of Boston college.
*  He'd been around the league a bunch.
*  He was in Cleveland with Kyle, where Kyle was there.
*  He's been with, he's been with Siano at Tampa.
*  He like, he's got a pretty good, he's got a really good defensive package.
*  Was it Ohio state was when they were good on defense.
*  So like, I think they were going to be better defensively.
*  They have talent on defense.
*  They underachieve defensively.
*  That front should have been way better than it was.
*  And there were times where that front was really good, but it was so inconsistent.
*  I think their offensive line is going to be better.
*  Jacobs.
*  Look, I think I loved Aaron Jones and I don't know what's the disconnect
*  between Aaron Jones and the team.
*  Because I thought Aaron Jones was the difference maker down the stretch.
*  I really do.
*  But Jacobs can do a lot of things Aaron Jones can do out of the backfield,
*  catch the ball if he's in shape, which he wasn't last year at all.
*  That it's a huge get 10.
*  I think they can get to 10.
*  I think you're going to, that's going to be a nail biter going down the stretch.
*  Really good team building by them where they have, I think I saw they have the
*  cheapest wide receiver crew in the league and they have good receivers.
*  They have a quarterback who is still on a good deal.
*  Um, just in general, like when you, when you can have a really good offense, but
*  not spend a shitload of money on that and the money can go other places, the
*  success rate of that is usually like 90, 95% if you could just stay healthy.
*  Well, that's what the chiefs are doing.
*  All the chiefs are doing is we're going to pay my homes.
*  We have to pay Kelsey.
*  We're going to beg and borrow an offense.
*  We're going to draft linemen and then we're going to put all the money on the
*  deep, we're going to draft the defense.
*  And so now we're really good on defense.
*  See, you know, go, let's go back to Atlanta.
*  One of the principles of Walsh was for you to win for Walsh to win, you know,
*  when this is when we have 14 games to be a 500 team, he used to say, you needed
*  to be able to get the, to have a good quarterback to get seven wins, but you
*  needed a pass rusher in the fourth quarter to win games for you.
*  Yeah.
*  You had to have somebody to rush the passer in that two minute
*  drive to put the game away.
*  If you don't have that, like you don't, you know, and
*  ball to green Bay has rushers.
*  I don't know if Arizona does, you know, I think Houston definitely does.
*  But we like Arizona's coach though.
*  Right.
*  They'd like, I thought Gannon did a pretty good job in the second half of the year.
*  I was surprised.
*  It was surprising considering that he was so vanilla in Philadelphia.
*  Yeah.
*  It was really played hard from, I thought that they did play hard.
*  We, we got to talk.
*  We didn't haven't talked Dallas, uh, under 10 and a half yet, because that's the
*  one I'm probably the most passionate about for the unders.
*  I don't, if that team is named any other team in the league, I think that over
*  unders eight and a half, but because Jerry and the Cowboys and the round TV
*  and DAC, I don't think people understand just how horrific that DAC contract has
*  been for them.
*  Did you see that stat about how he's been?
*  I think 151 million the last maybe four years, just counting on their cap.
*  It's by far the biggest cap hit any contract because of the way they did it.
*  They didn't give themselves any flexibility.
*  They didn't push any money forward.
*  And now it's just all hitting them this year.
*  On top of that, I didn't know, wasn't sure how good they were last year.
*  And they bring McCarthy back when everyone thought it was going to get fired.
*  I just, I don't see any scenario where this team is better this year than last
*  year.
*  I don't see it.
*  Well, I, and I'll add this.
*  I thought they overachieved last year.
*  I didn't think they were great last year.
*  That when they went on the road, everybody says they couldn't win a road game.
*  They couldn't beat a good team.
*  Right.
*  Well, why do you think that is?
*  You just think, cause McCarthy can't coach.
*  That's not the case.
*  They got turnstile playing right tackle.
*  They got ball first and go with the six against the Eagles and he can't block
*  Hassan Reddick and Prescott gets sacked.
*  And the next thing you know, they lose that game.
*  Like they go to Miami, they can't protect them in Miami and they lose that game.
*  I mean, so, and I don't think there is good now.
*  I think Zimmer is a better coach than Quinn defensively.
*  I think there's no question Zimmer will make them tougher, but do they have enough
*  talent?
*  You know, I mean, look, one thing about digs, he'll, he'll jump on any route.
*  We know that and Parsons is great, but who else is helping Parsons?
*  Right.
*  See, here's the problem with Dallas.
*  Every draft pick they made this year from in the first to the third round was an
*  indication of the, of the, of their problems with their team.
*  And so when that happens, when the draft has to fill the hole on the team coming
*  up, you can't do it.
*  The draft is for next year's team.
*  It's not for this year's team.
*  It's hard to get those guys to play.
*  They might start, but they can't play at the level you got to get them to play at.
*  They're not ready to play at that level.
*  So, you know, they draft these three guys, you know, like Maisie Smith, they
*  drafted last year at the 26 pick.
*  He gave them like three games, had like four tackles.
*  I mean, he was horrible.
*  Right.
*  So now you need the left tackle to come through or you're going to move
*  Tyler Smith over there.
*  Now you need the center.
*  Who's a good player, Bibi, that he played guard.
*  Are you going to put them at center?
*  Then you got the draft and a kid from, I forget, a small school to play defensive
*  end.
*  I mean, it's going to be a hard game for them.
*  I just don't see it.
*  I think, I think Washington will beat them.
*  I think Philly can beat them.
*  And I think they're vulnerable to anybody.
*  I mean, they got to go to Cleveland opening game.
*  I think Cleveland can beat them in the opener.
*  Yeah.
*  You look at the Cowboys season last year when everybody got excited about that
*  midway through the year, they beat, they beat the hell out of the giants.
*  They beat the hell out of the Panthers.
*  Congratulations to beat the hell out of Washington.
*  Congratulations.
*  Oh, we're on a three game winning streak.
*  They beat the Seahawks in that really fun night game where it's like, Oh,
*  Dak MVP.
*  See how it's going to make the playoffs by the way.
*  Then they beat the hell out of the Eagles.
*  And that was the one where we said, Oh, Dallas is serious.
*  We got it.
*  But now looking back at the second half of the season with the Eagles, that
*  win looks a lot less impressive.
*  And then it, it, it, it, they never really captured the same momentum, but then
*  they got absolutely destroyed in the playoffs and the playoffs going, they're
*  going to fire McCarthy.
*  They're going to hire Belichick.
*  Nope.
*  They didn't do that.
*  Well, are they going to trade Dak?
*  No, they're going to keep them.
*  Are they going to give a new contract?
*  No, they're not going to be like, they have Ezekiel.
*  How it is they're starting running back right now.
*  I, and they got, and look, you know, Dak, you know, we know this about the NFC.
*  There hasn't been a, there hasn't been a repeat champion in the last 10 years.
*  It hasn't been the Cowboys, the East, the Cowboys have won five, the Eagles have
*  won three, Washington's won two.
*  The giants haven't won any, but just say Prescott gets hurt here.
*  You know, now we're talking about them being one of those teams who could be
*  competing in the top 10 pick because they're not that good Cooper rush.
*  Ain't leaving them anywhere.
*  And I know they're going to give Trey Lance a ton of reps this summer, but
*  look, they still have to get lamb under contract.
*  They got to get Parsons on a contract.
*  There's things going on in that building that haven't been resolved yet.
*  And if they keep paying back like the giants paid Daniel Jones, then all of a
*  sudden the resentment's going to come through, right?
*  And I don't blame that for all the stuff, all the yields, but at some
*  point you got to make plays.
*  It's like, it's like Atlanta.
*  We have forgotten that Kirk Cousins sucks in big games.
*  Like that's got ever since he did that quarterback series, everybody's kind of
*  forgotten that he's not good at good games.
*  I haven't forgotten.
*  And I haven't forgotten that Dak never has come through either in any situation.
*  They're the same guy.
*  Um, Dallas under 10 and a half is my favorite.
*  I'm throwing two other quick ones at you.
*  These are ones I would call trying not to.
*  We're not going to get through everything because we're running out of time, but,
*  uh, trying not to get seduced is this next category Kansas city over under 11
*  and a half, the under is 11 and a half is even money right now.
*  This was she rice thing is a big deal.
*  And I, you know, Valdez scantling who turned into the boogie man for chiefs fans,
*  but actually made a couple of plays in the playoffs.
*  I, I actually still think he was open a lot.
*  You could at least throw in the ball.
*  He'd been in some games.
*  I wonder if their receiver room has passed the point of.
*  Competency because like even that Xavier worthy of that rookie, they took, listen,
*  I went down this road a lot of times during the Belichick Brady era.
*  You can't count on rookie receivers.
*  What if he sucks?
*  You it's a coin flip.
*  So there's a world where their receivers might just suck and might be as bad as
*  they were last year, but look, they have to play the same.
*  Like I really, I said this today on my show, like the chiefs early in the year
*  are going to be a team that they don't know who they are yet because if they
*  think they're going back to, they're going to throw it around a lot and win that way.
*  No change.
*  They have to run for Jekko.
*  They're going to have to win with their defense.
*  Do they have a replacement for Snead?
*  But think about what you just said.
*  They have to run Pacheco.
*  Like that's, that's your road to 12 wins.
*  Come on.
*  Well, you don't even, you, nobody, nobody in America is going to tell me who the
*  left tackle is, you know, I mean, they got the kid they draft that I can't say his
*  name in the second round, you think he's going to be ready to start at left tackle.
*  They got the Morris kid who they drafted in the second round a year ago.
*  Maybe they'll do it.
*  Maybe we'll see it this summer.
*  You paid Chris Jones now.
*  Chris Jones, a great player, but are you getting 17 games and 16 minutes out of him?
*  Kelsey too.
*  And you paid my homes.
*  You paid Kelsey and then you said that Kelsey looked like he's 26.
*  Every time I see Kelsey, he's on a plane or at a concert.
*  Like, I don't know where, you know, like I love Kelsey.
*  I think Kelsey is an incredible person to take less money for being an elite receiver,
*  but at 36, he's not the same guy he was.
*  Well, and the other thing is he basically admitted during the playoffs, like, yeah,
*  I had to take it easy during the regular season to try to save myself for, which I
*  agree with you're trying to win a super world, it's the right move.
*  But if we're just talking regular season and my only really good offensive receiving
*  target is pacing himself to get ready for January, that makes me nervous.
*  Right.
*  So like what people don't understand is a number one receiver has to draw coverage.
*  You have to double him on every single play.
*  Like you don't double Drake London.
*  Like you just put somebody out there.
*  Right.
*  And so it's like in the NBA, if you don't double the elite player or trap the elite
*  player, the guy's going to score Kyrie Irving only had nine points last night.
*  That should never happen.
*  He's too good.
*  Right.
*  So, but we mistaken all these other receivers as elite.
*  They're not like Hollywood Brown.
*  Nobody has said he might make a play here or there, but nobody's scared of him.
*  Nobody's scared of sky more.
*  Nobody's scared of, of anybody.
*  And so they don't have it and they have no left tackle.
*  The line's a little older.
*  And I think what we saw last year when they, when they played against good
*  fronts, they had a problem.
*  It could be one of those.
*  It's like mid October.
*  And so what's wrong with the chief's article and somehow they'll end up 10 and
*  seven, they'll make the playoffs.
*  Nobody want to play them.
*  Buffalo is the other one.
*  I'm zagging on this one.
*  Normally I am always under on Buffalo and I think they're overrated
*  and they miss their window.
*  Now it's like they're over under is 10 and a half.
*  They were 11 and six last year.
*  I don't think the digs thing is a big deal and they replaced them with a bunch
*  like Curtis Samuel and Valdez Scanling, and they drafted somebody and I think
*  they're going to be able to piece it together and everybody seems to forget
*  that James Cook became one of the four best running backs in the league.
*  They're in the second half last year.
*  They still have Allen.
*  They still have a good home field advantage.
*  They'll probably clean up some of the coaching issues they had.
*  And I think people are ready to pour dirt on these guys.
*  Now they still have Josh Allen.
*  Like to me, if he's healthy, that's 10 wins.
*  I'm tired of betting against that.
*  So the fact that it's 10 and a half, it's like, could they get to 11 and six?
*  Why not?
*  You know, here's the thing I think we also forget about Buffalo is that, and
*  somebody should tell Ryan Poles this in Chicago, Buffalo tried to be an 11 team.
*  One back, one receive three receivers, one tight end, and they play in Buffalo.
*  And they got the shit kicked out of my Cincinnati upfront and they
*  couldn't live that way.
*  So they drafted Kincaid and now with Dawson Knox, there were 12 team and
*  Cook came on last year and they round the ball because Kincaid is like a receiver,
*  but he can block the weak side.
*  So you have a run game with Kincaid out of in that game.
*  And so now you can't.
*  And so the, the, the effect of digs doesn't matter.
*  That's the thing.
*  Of digs doesn't matter.
*  That's why he was always pissed off because he wasn't featured anymore.
*  And he was declining.
*  And so because of where they play, I don't disagree with you on that.
*  I worry about them on defense because they're so little and they have, you know,
*  but look, Daquan Jones, when he's healthy, he makes them a really good team.
*  So the bet I like more than that, and this on Fando, it might be different
*  from where else, but Buffalo to win the AFC East is plus 160.
*  And Miami is plus one 85 and the jets are plus two 10.
*  I have no idea why one person would think Miami is going to be better next year
*  than this upcoming season of last year.
*  I think they missed their window.
*  And then the jets, did they change their coach?
*  And I didn't get the memo.
*  Is it, it's the same coach, right?
*  It's still Robert Sala.
*  I'm just checking.
*  Only a jet world could have come out that they were going to the moat.
*  They were going to replace hack it, but not fire.
*  Did you see that story?
*  Yeah.
*  So they were going to replace them, but not fire them.
*  And then what did they do?
*  They did nothing.
*  So they admit they have a problem, but they couldn't solve the problem
*  because they can't, they can't fire hack it because that would upset Aaron.
*  Like, how does that ever work?
*  I texted this to you.
*  They, the jets are like, when now, when now Aaron Rogers is our moment.
*  We're, we're all in, we're trying to win a Superbowl.
*  If you're all in higher, Mike Vrabel.
*  Yeah.
*  What are you guys doing?
*  Mike Vrabel is available or bell check, whatever bell check would
*  never work for the jets, right?
*  But Mike Vrabel it's like, are you better off with Robert Sala and Nate Hackett?
*  Or are you better off with Mike Vrabel who has already proven that he could
*  coach against all of these dudes and would completely change your culture.
*  And do you think you really think Rogers would have been upset if he had brought
*  Vrabel and of course he would have been like, he would have understood that.
*  Like, like why are we so scared to make Rogers upset?
*  Like Rogers is smart football guy.
*  Whatever you think of him and all the other stuff, he understands football.
*  Like he would have known, like he's got to see through solid.
*  Like I see through the guy's a cartoon character.
*  He's, I can't believe he's coming back.
*  What more do you have to say?
*  Just how he ended the Zach Wilson thing alone over the course of the year and
*  took no accountability for it.
*  Um, I just don't think he's a competent head coach and I feel pretty confident.
*  He's proven you correctly.
*  He's proven you correct.
*  I mean, like, look, you know, when he got that job, everybody, he was
*  interviewing all those jobs and nobody wanted them and Joe Douglas hired him.
*  And he was that, he doesn't get that job.
*  He's still in San Francisco.
*  What's that saying that you love about when somebody's trying to tell you who they are?
*  Believe who they are.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's Bill Parcells.
*  When, when a player shows you who he is, believe.
*  I feel like Salas showed me who he is as a head coach at this point.
*  I believe him.
*  I believe you're a number 500 coach.
*  Right.
*  So is Nathaniel Hackett.
*  And so why would I put my money in that?
*  Like, why would I put, like, that's my view on Arizona.
*  I believe what I see in Kyler Burr.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't believe he's can carry the team.
*  So I would have, I would have not given them the money.
*  I would have said, but Michael Bidwell put the, you know, they're not doing that.
*  I think that's going to catch up to him.
