# Bill Simmonsâ€™s Favorite Belichick Moments | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [January 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpEAoj5gO8)
*  Just to put a bow on the Belichick thing because it's been so long people forget stuff. I don't think people
*  remember realize or appreciate how important the blood so Brady decision was in 2001
*  where
*  He seemed insane when blood so had just gotten this hundred million dollar contract
*  Blood so is ready to come back
*  Most people in the media are like, oh, he's definitely getting his job back
*  But yet and I was in the minority but I was like Brady's plant. Why would we get rid of Brady?
*  He's like he's got it. Let's keep going and Belichick's like fuck it. I'm not I'm not benching Brady
*  Brady's still my QB. I
*  Don't think people appreciated what a difficult decision that was but for him that difficult at all, you know him
*  Like were you surprised you're you're working for the Raiders at that point
*  You must not have been surprised at all that he was like, yeah, fuck it. We're sticking with Brady
*  Yeah, I think that's when you learn that that there was a there was a connection between Brady and the team that you couldn't break
*  That connection like that wasn't a hard decision. I think in everybody's career. There's a Hall of Fame decision that you have to make right?
*  I
*  Mean craft, you know, you know craft made a Hall of Fame decision
*  When I thought crap today at the press conference made a really really smart
*  Smart statement that most it most the owners wouldn't have paid attention to Josh Harris probably didn't
*  but he said I was a new owner and
*  I didn't really know what it took and
*  I listened I'm paraphrasing and I didn't hire my with my gut
*  The guy wanted a hire and it took me two years to stop listening to people
*  I think if David Tepper or Josh Harris listen to that press conference
*  That was the whole essence of the press conference
*  Well, by the way, he was talking about he hired Pete Carroll when he really wanted to hire Belichick
*  And he didn't stick with his guts. There was a you got to hire Pete Carroll
*  Because because Drew Bledsoe's agent told him that Phil's a bad guy and it was a thousand people
*  I mean go back to read the Ian O'Connor back page of the New York Post
*  I mean, I mean we craft hired Belichick. That was a Hall of Fame decision
*  He belongs in the Hall of Fame for it because that was a Hall of Fame decision that he got roasted over that
*  he got lambasted over and
*  And now his franchise is worth 8 billion and and he so he paid so I think for bill
*  You know, there's certain times where you got to make that hard call, but that one with Brady
*  I think was and I think it was Brady just connected with the team just like Mac Jones can't connect with the team
*  Right, you know and just like you don't have black goes connecting with the Browns
*  In a way like it doesn't make sense, but we know it's happening
*  And Watson really doesn't connect that well
*  Yeah
*  I mean
*  So there is that and I think that bill when you look back on his career that Hall of Fame decision is
*  What propelled them to then go and play?
*  Connected like they did because that team that beat the Rams and beat us in the tuck game wasn't the most talented team
*  Now by far you didn't like your main Wiggins. You like your main Wiggins as a third free
*  Pass receiver
*  But eventually they got better but that structure allowed him to build his program
*  So when do you think?
*  What stretch of this pass run did it become clear that he had a chance to become the best coach of all time to you?
*  Well, I think when he when he when he won him back-to-back
*  You know when he won right when he won those back-to-back ones and you know for me he was always the best coach
*  I still have the notebook here when I gave it to John Shaw and said you should hire
*  I literally have a notebook that when John Shaw hired me
*  To put together what what took to be a great coach. The notebook says either hire
*  Bill Belichick or hiring Nick Saban. He said I can't hire Nick Saban. I just had rich Brooks. He's a coach for Morgan and
*  Belichick's toxic. He can't hire him. So I knew he was always going to be a great coach and I'm not saying that
*  Egotistically, but I knew it
*  Well because he worked with him and Saban in Cleveland so you run with them there were nobody there's nobody like them
*  There's nobody like either one of them and they're completely out there were truly Oscar and Felix
*  They're completely from different worlds
*  But they come together and they have such mutual respect for one another that they have such they stay exchange ideas and it works
*  So I mean I think after he won that second Super Bowl in a row
*  I mean the ability to recreate his team is remarkable
*  Yeah, you always and we've been you and I have been doing podcasts for a long time
*  that the thing you always said about him that I love that I just brazenly stole for the rest of the time I knew you was
*  how
*  He didn't have a philosophy or a structure or like some sort of system. He was not a system guy
*  His system was who's on my team this year
*  What's the best way we can compete with the guys I have this year?
*  And then if you just put them on another team, he'd be like, oh who's on this team?
*  Alright, we'll play this way and the fact that what do you think?
*  99% of coaches don't seem to understand that that
*  Just about everybody's like here's my system. Here's my philosophy. I felt that way with McVeigh this year McVeigh looked at the Rams
*  He's like, oh, all right. Here's my team and he just figured we're gonna do I have two really good receivers
*  Oh shit
*  Now I have this awesome running back and he just kind of figured out on the fly but next year could have been
*  But why don't most coaches think that way?
*  Because they're all system based they're all about their system. We're gonna their systems gonna work. This is what's gonna work
*  We got to run our system. Our system will work
*  We got to get the players to operate within the system. And so we're Belichick starts very simplistically
*  Right. His whole thing is simplistically to complicated
*  so what he does is is his sister what he installs is a base system and
*  Then based on the week they have to play a team
*  It becomes complex where if you start complex you can't get simple
*  Yeah, nobody understands it
*  But if you start simple you can become complex that week and then you change it back the other way and then you make the
*  Other team play left-handed. I mean think about it, you know
*  One of the strengths of the team should have been their pass rush, but they never could get ahead in the game to rush
*  Right. They could never get ahead in the game to rush
*  so he knew this summer his team was upside down because the strength of the team was
*  The ability to maybe create turnovers with their multiple fronts their multiple looks and yet they couldn't they couldn't get points to start the game
*  with so
*  Those are the hard ones again. It goes back to production and design, you know
*  When those two things are together and he does a really good job of that. Here's what we want to do
*  It's the offseason. It's like right now
*  This is what we have to do to win if you're in the Atlanta Falcons organization or you're somewhere
*  There has to be a strategy on what it's going to take to win the division you're in and that strategy is players in place
*  Steve Kers in a little bit of a similar situation right now the Warriors where and he's not a system guy
*  But sometimes your collection of players doesn't work and how do you solve it and how do you put the right people like they don't have
*  enough size
*  They don't they don't have the same kind of length and athleticism that they used to they have this curry
*  thing that where he bounces off like how do you fix this and sometimes you can't and
*  There's been some interesting Belichick seasons
*  Where he just couldn't fix it like he couldn't fix the offense this year because it was impossible to fix we had that
*  You know that the Matt Castle year when that team was pretty good
*  They end up going I think 11 and 5 but there was a lot of talent on that team
*  But fundamentally the best part in the team was still probably Randy Moss, but he had Matt Castle's his QB
*  So I can fix this but I can't really rig it
*  Watching him problem solve on the fly. There was a year Troy Brown was a nickelback
*  Super Bowl team is like we need another defensive back. That was kind of my favorite part of the Belichick
*  like he would just like scotch tape and
*  Just like thumbtacks and just kind of this is what we need to do this week
*  And I'll miss that the most I think
*  You
