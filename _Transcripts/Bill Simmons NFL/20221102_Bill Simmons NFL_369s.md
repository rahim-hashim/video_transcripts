# Will the Dolphins Regret Trading for Bradley Chubb? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [November 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N7jWVLBEJw)
*  The reason the Dolphins had a first round pick to trade for Bradley Chubb is because
*  they were moving back out of the third overall pick, right?
*  They were like a terrible team that was falling apart and they were firing their coach and
*  the owner was getting cited for tampering and like this was a total mess.
*  But then hey, you got Tyreek Hill in the building.
*  Every time two of plays your offense looks great.
*  Why not go get a Bradley Chubb?
*  Because the Packers aren't what they were, the Bucks aren't what they were, the Rams
*  aren't what they were, the Broncos aren't what they were.
*  There's room.
*  There's space in the top to kind of push and try to get into this second tier of NFL
*  contenders.
*  And I think that's going to convince a lot of teams that hey, some of these expiring
*  contract players like Bradley Chubb, like Roekwon Smith, like TJ Hawkinson, like Chase
*  Claypool, they're worth it.
*  Let's take a swing.
*  Sheel, Miami trades back in that Lance trade.
*  They got a first round pick.
*  They used it to move up for Waddle that same year.
*  They sent another one to Casey for Tyreek and then they sent another one for Chubb.
*  And Tray Lance isn't playing.
*  It's a pretty amazing trade.
*  I mean, it's early.
*  Tray Lance could end up being whatever, but pretty amazing how that works out.
*  Like we always talk about blue chippers, red chippers, pink chippers, all different chippers.
*  At least two blue chippers and Waddle is probably a red chipper, but that is about as well as
*  it works out for a team of the trade, right?
*  Yeah.
*  No doubt.
*  And they traded up to get Waddle.
*  They could have had an even more picks, but not, I mean, Waddle's turned out great for
*  him.
*  He's been fantastic, but they had even more draft ammo.
*  Yeah, it goes back to the old like, you know, draft thing.
*  When in doubt, just trade back and get more picks and take more shots on players.
*  Sort of the analytical thinking about it.
*  I don't think it's always the right thing to do.
*  Specifically, if you need a quarterback, I feel like you got to take a shot on a quarterback.
*  But yeah, you mentioned it.
*  If they were riding with Tua, you can move back.
*  You can get these extra picks.
*  I don't, I'm not fully on board with Ben with this, with this Chubb trade.
*  I mean, I look at it and the one worry I have is when you trade for a guy like Chubb, who's
*  in the last year of his contract, when that extension is not part of the trade, now all
*  of a sudden he has all the, all the leverage in this.
*  I mean, at the end of the season, if you don't sign him to an extension, now he can say,
*  all right, what are you going to do?
*  Franchise tag me, just not sign me.
*  You gave up a first round pick for me.
*  You're not going to keep me here anymore.
*  So he's a player who's had some injury issues.
*  You know, I think he played in what?
*  25 games the previous three seasons.
*  So I understand going for it.
*  I usually like being aggressive.
*  If I were in that front office, I'd be saying, Hey guys, you know, Josh Allen, Patrick
*  Mahomes, are we sure we're going to be competing with them this year?
*  Do we want to give up a first round pick right now?
*  So I'm not fully on board with that one.
*  I think it's okay.
*  I think it's defensible.
*  It's a very good player who's young at a premium position, but I'm not sure I would
*  have made that deal if I were the Dolphins.
*  I would definitely say the logic of like how the Dolphins so quickly convinced themselves,
*  like, Hey, let's push, let's contend right now.
*  That to me makes sense.
*  A first for Nick or for Bradley Chubb, excuse me, is healthy.
*  That is a big swing at the plate.
*  And when we talked to Sheil on extra point taken on the ringer NFL feed, I talked about
*  Josh Allen, the Jaguars rusher to the Dolphins, because that made more sense to me from a
*  scheme fit perspective.
*  Bradley Chubb here still works.
*  But now you got like just like a big traditional rush defensive end with Jalen Phillips,
*  who's also that like Melvin Ingram is going to come off the bench now and kind of they
*  need a player of his role to drop and coverage a little bit weird.
*  So I'm very interested to see how well Bradley Chubb works for the Dolphins.
*  I get why they did it.
*  It is a very pretty penny for what to me is like a second, third tier rusher in the
*  league.
*  You know, Sheil makes a good point in the extension.
*  I like the totality of what they did.
*  But if I'm doing that, I need to feel like I'm going to win the Super Bowl.
*  And here's my fear for the Dolphins.
*  This is why as a Pats fan, I was kind of glad they did this.
*  They're coming off.
*  They beat Pittsburgh 16 to 10, a game that really, if Kenny Pickett makes one throw,
*  Pittsburgh might have actually stolen that game.
*  And then they beat the trip by four.
*  And I know you guys know all the numbers and stats from that game, but I mean,
*  Detroit's one of the worst defenses in the last couple of years.
*  Hill was open, like where there was no lions around him on the TV when he was open,
*  like that kind of open.
*  And I just wondered, are you overreacting because you're coming off?
*  Like you barely beat the lions.
*  Now they have Chicago and Cleveland coming up as their next two by week, then
*  Houston, and then it gets harder after that.
*  But I don't know when you throw in the fact that two is one more hit away from
*  not playing again this season, it felt pretty risky to me.
*  I'm with you.
*  I'm with you, Shail.
*  I don't think this closes the gap with Buffalo and Kansas City, but if they can
*  sign Chubb to an extension and you put him and Phillips together, Chubb's 26,
*  Phillips is 23, and that's what you're just going forward with those two guys.
*  I like that longterm.
*  And the other thing is let's, you know, some organizations, you look at a move
*  like this and you're like, they deserve the benefit of doubt.
*  Okay.
*  They're going for it.
*  The Dolphins changed their mind on what they want to be every three months.
*  They're tampering on boats with Tom Brady and Sean Payton and they're
*  firing Brian Flores and I mean, they like Tua, then they're trying to trade for
*  Deshaun Watson.
*  I mean, they changed their mind on who they think they are every three months.
*  And so I'm not going to give them the benefit of the doubt in this situation.
*  Now, if you're a fan, like, I don't like going overboard with this because if I'm
*  like a Dolphins fans right now, I'm just like, cool, I'm excited.
*  Our team has been irrelevant.
*  We've sucked.
*  Now we have a fun offense.
*  For the most part, we made a big trade for a pass rusher.
*  Let's go have fun and have a fun 2022 season and think about the rest after that.
*  So I think there's two sides of it, but yeah, he's not going to be cheap.
*  I mean, he will probably command, I would say 18 to $20 million per year for Bradley
*  Chubb if you're going to sign him to an extension.
*  And if he has the leverage, it could even go north of that.
