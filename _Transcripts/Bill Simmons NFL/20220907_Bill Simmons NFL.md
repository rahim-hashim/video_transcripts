# Bill Simmons Is All In on the Carolina Panthers | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQQdeQODsXE)
*  The case for Carolina to make the playoffs four to one.
*  Matt Ruhl, year three.
*  First two years of Baylor, eight and 17.
*  Levin wins third season.
*  First two years of Temple, eight and 16.
*  Won 10 games in year three.
*  Matt Ruhl is a year three guy.
*  I have very little evidence to back that up other than that stat.
*  Last year, the Panthers were three and oh.
*  Yeah.
*  Blew a couple of close games.
*  The wheels came off.
*  McCaffrey got hurt.
*  All of a sudden, Cam Newton was back, who was done three years ago.
*  He goes 0-5.
*  McCaffrey missed 10 games.
*  I'm going to give you a quiz.
*  Okay.
*  Touchdowns, picks, fumbles.
*  Those are the three categories.
*  In descending order, I'm going to give you the numbers 21, 16, and 14.
*  Which one do you think was touchdowns?
*  Which one do you think was fumbles?
*  Which one do you think was picks for Carolina quarterbacks last year?
*  21, 16, 14.
*  All right.
*  I'm going to guess 21 were the picks.
*  Correct.
*  Okay.
*  I'm going to guess 16 was the touchdowns.
*  You were wrong.
*  It was 14.
*  Oh.
*  Okay.
*  14 touchdowns, 21 picks, and 16 fumbles.
*  That was their quarterback position last year.
*  Can I push back on a number of things here?
*  Number one.
*  I'm not done.
*  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
*  I'm going through my rehearsal.
*  I got four ball points left.
*  They bring in Baker Mayfield.
*  Okay.
*  Baker Mayfield, 2020.
*  11-5 on the Browns.
*  Made round two.
*  Came within...
*  What? Why are you making a face?
*  No, no, no.
*  This is the one point I'm 100% with you on.
*  Baker.
*  Came within a chest hair of beating the Chiefs.
*  Remember who was the backup quarterback?
*  Chad Henney comes in and has to make like a third down throw.
*  The Browns are lingering.
*  Baker Mayfield that year, 26 touchdowns, eight picks.
*  So was hurt last year.
*  Played hurt the whole year.
*  Gamer.
*  Yes.
*  Shouldn't have been out there.
*  They kept throwing him out there.
*  So at least we know healthy Baker Mayfield.
*  He's not going to throw 21 picks and fumble the ball 16 times and throw four touchdowns.
*  It is an upgrade.
*  Next.
*  You're going to laugh.
*  New offensive coordinator, Ben McAdoo.
*  Kind of a punchline.
*  That was one of my bullet points.
*  Gets fired second year during the Giants season, which was basically Eli's last day.
*  And Eli was like Rob Thesburger last year in the Steelers.
*  But 2016 Ben McAdoo's first year as head coach for the Giants with a washed up Eli.
*  They go 11 and five.
*  They're eight and three in one score games.
*  They're one of the least penalized teams in the league.
*  The two years before that, they were 13th in points in 2014.
*  They were sixth in points in 2015 with Ben McAdoo.
*  Last year's offensive coordinator, they just fired him with like what?
*  Four game Joe Brady with like four games to go.
*  They told him to leave.
*  Coordinators never get fired with like, but they're like, hey, here's your check.
*  You're done.
*  He's going to be better than that guy.
*  Right?
*  I don't know if that's true.
*  I also think that part of the Joe Brady firing was that he wasn't running.
*  It was a philosophical difference with with Matt Rule and that he wasn't running the ball enough.
*  And there were there's some real questions around Joe Brady's firing.
*  He's the quarterbacks coach now and in Buffalo, by the way.
*  I don't I would not assume that Ben McAdoo is an upgrade over Joe Brady.
*  I would not.
*  Well, I can tell you this, Kevin Clark, he will get along with his coach better than Joe Brady did.
*  I have three more bullet points.
*  They have two legit skill guys, McCaffrey, who is going to be probably the highest paid auction guy
*  in the in whatever fantasy draft this year and DJ Moore, who's quiet, boring every year has 1200 yards.
*  Sure.
*  So two guys that I like that's good for good for Mayfield.
*  McCaffrey come back.
*  I'm not sure they're going to he's going to have quite the same usage rate,
*  but if he's at least healthy, he's still one of the 10 best running backs.
*  They drafted.
*  And I'm going to screw this name up.
*  Ike Ike.
*  Ike.
*  OK, Ike.
*  They drafted him sixth in the NFL draft this year, which you might have watched as a left tackle.
*  So that that that short we'll see.
*  We'll find out from him against Miles Garren week one.
*  I kept four elite guys in their defense.
*  Burns, Thompson, Horn and Shin.
*  That's good.
*  That's something.
*  Plus, like the two guys we don't know are awesome yet.
*  No, I'm sure in there.
*  Here's their QB opponent schedule.
*  My last thing for you.
*  They play four really good QBs.
*  Stafford, Burrow, Lamar and Wilson.
*  And they play Brady twice, of course.
*  So there's six out of the 17 games we know they're going against a good quarterback,
*  assuming none of those guys get hurt.
*  They play Jamis twice.
*  They play Mariotta twice.
*  They play Kyla without Hopkins in the first five weeks.
*  They play Trey Lance.
*  I don't know what to expect from him.
*  They play Burset, Daniel Jones, Trubisky, Jared Goff and Geno Smith.
*  Ten and seven.
*  OK, that was extremely compelling case.
*  It was significantly better than I thought it was going to be.
*  OK, they're not on my list for a number of reasons.
*  I do want to before I start going through it, I do want to say I completely agree with you.
*  I'm Baker.
*  There's a lot of people who say two things.
*  Number one, this is what a lot of guys look like if they played as hard as Baker was last year.
*  It wasn't just the shoulder.
*  It was the foot too.
*  And there's an argument he made that if he shut it down, he would have made a hell of a lot more
*  money. He didn't want to, as you said, gamer.
*  And just the fact that he's just going to play better this year.
*  And he's pissed off.
*  And a guy like Baker, when he's pissed off, is going to play better.
*  The biggest thing for me that's keeping me from from Panther's hype is I don't really know anybody
*  who said a good thing in the NFL about Matt Rule, about anything that he's done that's impressed
*  them at any level.
*  And it's flipped because there are guys in the college world who swear that Matt Rule
*  crushed evals in recruiting.
*  And the way he was able to scout for guys who were fast, who were going to develop into NFL guys was
*  really astounding when you talk to guys who follow recruiting really well.
*  And so I'd heard that 18 months ago, whatever, and think, OK, Matt Rule's really got it.
*  He uses analytics, he uses a bunch of different stuff, and it just hasn't shown up there at all.
*  I don't think he's a good in-game manager.
*  I don't think he inspires guys well.
*  I just I don't think Ben McAdoo is a good offensive coordinator.
*  I think Baker's going to be the bright spot here.
*  I just think you think about David Tepper, a guy you think about a lot as far as just
*  kind of a modern owner.
*  If things start to go south, man, they can go south real fast with a guy who wants to win now,
*  who will spend to win now.
*  I mean, it was funny because I was doing a story last year and somebody said to
*  me, this is not a new thing.
*  I've heard it before, but there's three types of owners, owners who spend, know how to win
*  and do win, owners who don't want to win, don't spend, you know, don't even care.
*  You know the type.
*  And then the third group is the group that spends, wants to win and hasn't figured out
*  how.
*  OK, like the cons in Jacksonville are a good example of this.
*  David Tepper is another one of these guys.
*  He's committed to winning.
*  He just doesn't figure out how to win.
*  OK.
*  And for me, I think that that means you're going to see a quicker trigger finger if they
*  start out owing to it.
*  I think that everybody in that building starts to feel that at some point.
*  Good point.
*  Here's my counter.
*  First five weeks.
*  Home against Cleveland and Jacoby Berset, who, by the way, was unplayable last year.
*  You saw it.
*  What?
*  Week two at the Giants.
*  Yes.
*  Week three home for New Orleans.
*  Week four home for Arizona without.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, yeah, that's James.
*  Yeah.
*  James and Carolina was like, oh, my God, James through four picks.
*  Jesus.
*  Week four, Arizona, no Deandre Hopkins in Carolina.
*  Kyle Murray outdoors on grass.
*  And then week five, San Francisco at Carolina.
*  Trey Lance.
*  That could be four in one.
*  You've made an incredibly compelling case.
*  I'm almost on board if not for the fact that my team like that at the Dolphins.
