**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a1ZmkWV4mo)
*  I mentioned earlier the team that I've liked all year, all offseason. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a1ZmkWV4mo&t=0.0s)]
*  This is my team. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a1ZmkWV4mo&t=4.4s)]
*  This is the one you like. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a1ZmkWV4mo&t=5.84s)]
*  I'm in on Pittsburgh. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a1ZmkWV4mo&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a1ZmkWV4mo&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  I'm in. I'm in on Pickett, Pickens, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a1ZmkWV4mo&t=7.92s)]
*  that Jaylen Warren is probably going to take Najee Harris's job at some point. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a1ZmkWV4mo&t=11.68s)]
*  They fixed the offensive line. It's at least decent now. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a1ZmkWV4mo&t=17.04s)]
*  They have Watt back for the whole year. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a1ZmkWV4mo&t=21.12s)]
*  Seven and two they finished last year. A lot of that was without Watt. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a1ZmkWV4mo&t=23.28s)]
*  Tomlin never has had a losing season as you've heard that's that many times. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a1ZmkWV4mo&t=26.64s)]
*  I like the talent and I don't think their schedule is that hard. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a1ZmkWV4mo&t=31.92s)]
*  Week one they have San Francisco. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a1ZmkWV4mo&t=37.76s)]
*  I think Pittsburgh is going to beat San Francisco [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a1ZmkWV4mo&t=40.4s)]
*  and could potentially become the over reaction team. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a1ZmkWV4mo&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  And I like San Francisco. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a1ZmkWV4mo&t=45.84s)]
*  I just think Pittsburgh is going to show up for that game, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a1ZmkWV4mo&t=47.2s)]
*  lay the smack down and we're off. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a1ZmkWV4mo&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  I believe in the Steelers, Sal. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a1ZmkWV4mo&t=52.08s)]
