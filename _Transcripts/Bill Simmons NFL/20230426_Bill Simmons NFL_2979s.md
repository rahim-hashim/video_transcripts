# Burning NFL Draft Questions With Bill Simmons | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [April 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTF27BTEL-c)
*  Burning questions for the draft. So this is a retroactive one
*  But after you know when when this trade happened like the ringer draft guide I hadn't really dove into it yet
*  I hadn't watched the shows. I hadn't listened to a bunch of podcasts including the one you're on the ringer your draft show
*  We're an NFL draft show right? Yeah, I know we just do all the drafts out there
*  We're gonna transition an NFL just fire off
*  May 1st so they Carolina trades up and they give up a lot mm-hmm
*  and they give up DJ more in the trade too, but they also give up a bunch of picks and
*  You do that and you're like I better I know what I'm getting at one and it seems like they're taking Bryce Young even though
*  There's a little red. It's scary astray, but
*  Bracings even odds which did you bet that yeah?
*  I got Bryce Young when it went strad was still the heavy favorite when
*  Stroud was when when they first made the trade all the reporting on shroud was like and the Panthers
*  Think it's CJ Stroud. Yeah markets went nuts
*  They were like CJ CJ CJ and it's like all right it very much sounds like they're still gonna do homework on this
*  Yeah, and I Dave temper the owner had been pretty clear in the season that he had liked will levis
*  That was like a commonly known rumor in like November December
*  So like all right click the ownership isn't fully involved yet like CJ Stroud seems like it's more of a coaching staff thing
*  Let's just let this play out and then pretty quickly after the Panthers met Bryce Young before his pro day in Alabama
*  There started to be some Bryce Young smoke, and then that's just carried in so when did you get it? What were the odds?
*  Things alongside was like plus 300 plus 350. I didn't do it till even on yeah
*  It just became clear like culture guy
*  He said the teams that's like in in documentaries and stuff when people like storytelling. It's crucial
*  We're gonna. We're gonna do a lot of storytelling
*  With when they draft like a quarterback. It's like sir. He's a culture guy
*  Nobody's ever not a culture guy. I
*  Guess like maybe Jalen Carter. Maybe not a culture guy at this point. He's had some issues. You wouldn't draft him ago
*  Yeah, he's a culture guy. That's what we want to be like there you go like he's incredibly talented
*  it's
*  Overwhelming for it wasn't a culture guy because he went back to school for a senior year to get his
*  He was like biochem art his biochem degree
*  He's planning for life after 35 what what a day
*  And then Baker wasn't a character guy until everybody decided it was cool that he was in a hole and then he became a culture guy
*  He'll get he gives you a little a few
*  Yeah, so with Bryce it seems like part of this is always poised. He's the hardest worker
*  He's the first guy there last guy to leave all that stuff
*  the problem is he
*  The moment some 330 pound guy falls on him right who the hell knows and it so nobody can be wrong with Bryce Young
*  You could say he's awesome
*  But and you'd be right you could say he's too small
*  He's gonna get hurt you're covered every which way because at some point he will get hurt cuz all quarterback
*  This is like the least controversial argument to have by saying, but it seems like he's gonna go number one. Yeah
*  My question is was that trade worth it was it worth it to move up from nine?
*  To get this guy that everybody agrees is a huge question mark because of his size
*  Like if I was a Panthers fan, and we have one Stephen Ruiz somehow we have a Panthers fan on staff unacceptable
*  I would just be going nuts at this trade like yes like why did we give up all this stuff?
*  He was he said to me today. I shouldn't have watched Anthony Richardson film
*  Gonna be mad when they take price young yeah, so why do that trade?
*  Well, I honestly I never have agreed with the idea that you trade up and not know who you're taking and it sounds like that's
*  What they did so it's kind of what seems this guy did too right that didn't work out either
*  It makes no sense
*  I guess you could I think there's like a rationalization in the media like oh you want to be able to control the draft so
*  Therefore you trade up and so you can control there's less chaos or whatever
*  I don't like take the guy who you really like if you're gonna trade
*  multiple future first-round picks or you know all that
*  Draft capital and DJ more like you should have conviction that this guy is gonna change and turn around our franchise
*  We love this guy. He's everything we've ever wanted. That's why we're doing this not
*  Well, we'll go up and get like the guy we decided that we like the most like to me that never makes sense
*  In addition, it's like basically saying we've decided we're living on this street
*  Right. We don't have the house yet. We've picked a street
*  We like the school district and then you're kind of stuck with the street and now they're kind of stuck
*  Like what if they do this deep dive anyway hand or a pretty no
*  I'm just the other thing that like worries me about Bryce Young is like he's already like we've talked about this ad nauseum through this process
*  But he's already like an outlier of outliers. He's the smallest
*  early round quarterback of all time by like a lot. Hmm, not just short but slight and
*  So not only are you betting on this guy's not gonna be the outlier but you're betting
*  Multiple picks and and play and a really good player like you're rolling the dice with real capital
*  Yeah, and so like on one hand I can kind of see like a team would be like, yeah
*  we're gonna bet we're gonna take this guy with our pick and say it's like two or three or five or whatever and
*  That's like the bet we're making but like trading all this capital like basically making the bet of your life on this guy
*  And then also he's like a massive massive outlier like to me
*  That's what's a little bit worrisome about this whole thing. I like the rice young
*  Well, especially you could have just gotten Lamar Jackson
*  Who's like 48 right 20 is the starting quarterback and just giving up number nine the end of like 12 different teams
*  Strategies over the last month ends with and you could have just gotten Lamar Jackson for so many teams is just kind of land on that note
*  Here's what I would make is the argument for like why you trade up to one you said like are you get control?
*  I can't wait for this. This is exciting. I'm gonna make the case. This is devil's advocate
*  This is not full on advocating
*  but you say right like trade up for one and you have control over the draft and you kind of you know,
*  Avoid the chaos and and and alright, what does that mean? Like what does that look like?
*  Yeah, the Texans are at two are going through that right now
*  The Texans were at two and when the Bears owned to the first overall pick which lest we forget
*  Lovey Smith multiple fourth down conversions got the Texans out of one gave it to the Bears. Love you
*  Lovey
*  Yeah
*  anyway
*  with the Texans at two they were trying to trade up to one at the same time that the Panthers were trying to do it and
*  Everybody was trying to do it and the Texans didn't get that done and now they're sitting there at two all
*  Cycle long they've been connected to Bryce Young and then all of a sudden it turns out the Panthers are gonna be the team that takes
*  Bryce young they're gonna take him at one now the Texans at two were 48 hours out or in disarray
*  No one knows what they're doing. They don't know what they're doing
*  They're their next best quarterback on the board is Will Levis
*  There's pressure from ownership to take him
*  The the the coaching staff of the front office wants to take a pass rusher
*  They're split on which pass rusher to take some guys you talk to some people know like oh Houston has Tyree Wilson above
*  Will Anderson you speak to another person like yeah, he's got Will Anderson about Tyree Wilson
*  They got no idea what they're doing if they are a house divided and that's why having first overall is control
*  That's why I'm first of all you avoid this issue and it's a nice issue to avoid
*  It shouldn't necessarily cost
*  Next year's first round pick ninth overall pick and DJ Moore, right?
*  And that's that's right. The Panthers pay a steep price for that would have been nice to keep DJ Moore
*  Real nice my hot not full not stoned about Adam Thielen
*  We've never seen him ever with a good quarterback in his entire career would have been it would have liked to have seen it for five
*  Minutes. Yeah, you said Houston's in disarray. That was my next question
*  So they have two and they have 12. Yep, and there's four quarterbacks
*  Three of which I think we can agree are pretty
*  Pretty shaky Bryce is probably the least shaky but also the most likely to get her solid guy
*  Well, I would say Bryce would be the quote-unquote solid guy unless you love one of the other three
*  But odds are you could get somebody at 12
*  so you just take the best guy in the draft at two and
*  Then just kind of keep your fingers crossed at 12 or you trade up and yet
*  This is not how the NFL works. They're gonna panic just like the Jets did with Eric Rogers
*  They think we got we got to get her guy here and they're gonna take him in two
*  Which will then leave the best part in the draft for Arizona at three, whoever that is
*  That's another thing about this draft know everybody disagrees under the best part of the draft is right
*  But if I if I'm Houston Danny
*  Why not just take the best player to and then figure it out watch how the draft evolves
*  Maybe it's a field situation from a couple years ago or oh, he's he's still whoa. He's he's still there
*  He's at eight. He's at nine. All right, I'll trade up and get him like why not do that
*  I mean, I think that's I honestly ultimately think that's what they're gonna do in my final mock
*  I've got them taking Will Anderson at number two, although there is some
*  Sense that it might be Tyree Wilson instead
*  We don't know yet really but Will Anderson is my top ranked player in this class
*  And I think they really like him or at least some
*  Portion of the team really likes him
*  And so yeah
*  I think that ultimately since there is there seems to be disagreement on what quarterbacks they like or how much they like the
*  quarterbacks that are left
*  Just take the guy that you're really convicted on and see what happens later in the job. You like Will Anderson more. Yeah
*  What do you think Ben?
*  I like Will Anderson a lot more in Tyree Wilson who's the edge rusher out of Texas Tech who might go above Will Anderson at two
*  He might go above Will Anderson at three. He might go at five. He's very highly ranked by the league big guy physical guy
*  Use your robot brain and give me the best case scenarios for each guy
*  Tyree Wilson I think is gonna be like a Jason Pierre Paul sort of a guy right?
*  I can do bad. Yeah with ten fingers. Yeah, Will Anderson gets called like 90% Khalil Mack
*  Which I think is is is a little rich for me personally, but you can see that outcome
*  He's like Will Anderson's really fundamentally tough. He's very good against the running play ton of positions
*  He's just not gonna be a perennial like 10 12 sack guy
*  Which is what you want to be drafting at edge rusher in the top five
*  You want to be getting a Nick Boso miles Garret Joey Bosa we've just been spoiled with some of those classes
*  You know, you know, I know nothing about college football
*  Yeah, but I do know I am the VP of common sense. Okay, as you know
*  I don't like the whiff of Will Anderson. No, I'm taking I'm taking that guy
*  Basically, I'm saying he's the best player in the draft. I
*  Need a higher ceiling than 90% Khalil Mack
*  There was a guy that was that best player in the draft and it was Jalen Carter and the Jalen Carter film was was
*  Incredible and he was an endemic ensue flusher Cox like player and then he had he was arrested during the NFL combine a warrant
*  Yeah, there's some baggage driving yeah, but if we're just doing this in a vacuum which is my next question
*  Like Jalen Carter and B. John Robinson are the two best players in the draft, right?
*  Yeah, I got Jalen Carter one and B. John three. I'm Anderson too if we're gonna bet
*  Who's gonna be not just a blue chipper but like a dark blue chipper like a really like deep blue sea kind of a blue chipper
*  Just a blue just blue miles and miles of blue blue chipper
*  Those would be the two safest bets right? Yeah, Jalen Carter B. John Robinson
*  John be my bet for for the lack of the off-fields Jalen Carter is gonna go like somewhere between five and eight
*  And B. John Robinson could fall out of the top ten because everyone's so terrified of taking running backs
*  I think will Anderson's a blue chipper. Yeah, I do too
*  I mean, I honestly I think he's got really high upside and a really high floor
*  He is everything you hear from him is he's like the best guy in terms of work ethic all football leadership
*  He loves ball like saving can't say enough good things about this guy in addition to his physical traits
*  He has absolutely ridiculous production like everything you could want and now we're telling ourselves
*  He did so we're picking him apart a tiny bit. I think I think we're overthinking him
*  He had people like talk about his down season this year. He had 10 sacks and 17 TFLs
*  Yeah, and that was like defense is like yeah game planning for him specifically. It hasn't been arrested
*  So he was playing defensive tackle too. He's playing inside of the tackle at like 255 pounds
*  He's just take him in no brainer then just take him. Yeah
*  Yeah, or take a quarterback to make sure you get ones. You have to start Davis Mills again. It's tough for Houston
*  Well, all right, so
*  Unwinding the the Philadelphia 76ers once upon a time they did the process and part of the process was swept the nets, by the way
*  Part of the process was not only are we taking upside guys
*  But we're actually kind of wounding next year's team too with what we're doing
*  Take this guy who you know, we know he has a knee in B. We know he has an injury
*  He's probably not gonna play next year, but that's fine because we'll just suck again
*  We'll get another top for pick from Houston
*  What am I gonna do like win the Super Bowl next year?
*  right if I don't love any of the quarterbacks and there's
*  Better star power on the quarterback position next year
*  Why not roll it over like who right their fans are tortured anyway?
*  It's not like there's been a ton of fun times in Houston
*  Don't they have two first runners next year too, or am I misremembering that for the Watson trade? I think so
*  Yeah, but yeah, yeah
*  Why not make 24 the year with like 24 is our year which though there are arguments for that because of the 2024 quarterback class
*  I wrote about this today Kayla Williams at a USC who he's the first guy since
*  Homes who we're gonna give my homes comps to everybody's like saying you
*  The way he plays is very my homes exactly. Yeah, you watch him and you're like, oh, who's that one quarterback?
*  Oh, it's 15 15 is the guy who does that right? He looks exactly like it. Why can't you put him in a chief's uniform?
*  I don't know if I could tell the difference like so
*  2024 like there are arguments for that. I think that's the direction the Cardinals are going frankly
*  You look at the Cardinals roster. I think they'd go about 500 in the XFL
*  Nobody throws away NFL seasons, but they really should you can just do it by right, you know rolling over the season
*  The thing I would the thing I would say for the Texans that makes it tricky is this
*  General managers second most important job build a championship team win championships win Super Bowls first most important job
*  Keep the job, baby. Stay employed cash the check
*  So if you're Nick Casario and you're getting pressure from your owner to draft the quarterback, which is what I believe is happening in Houston
*  You want to stick to your guns and draft an edge rusher? That's fine. I
*  Cannot guarantee you will be around to draft the quarterback next year. And that's why you see teams oftentimes take that quarterback
*  I say GM's take that quarterback Steve kind made this comment just today the ex general manager of the of the Cardinals
*  They said why'd you take Kyle Amur over Nick Bosa?
*  And he said this Kyle Amur he got me extended and Nick Bosa would have got me fired
*  Steve kind of apparently does not know he has to take joshua's in the air before also Steve kind has been fired
*  So it didn't really work super great
*  But right that that's the thing is is if you're getting ownership pressure as a general manager your priorities change like yeah
*  You could probably build a better contender if you had that two-year look
*  But if you're gonna lose the job if you don't take a quarterback
*  NFL so different than NBA because an NBA the smart move is
*  To actually roll it over with the owner and be like, hey man
*  We're just gonna take the best player next year's our year and then you're inadvertently buying yourself an extra year because the owner's going
*  Well, he told me this year we're not gonna be good, but it's all gonna pay off next year
*  And then you bought a year that's basically Sam Presti has been and he's done it the most brilliantly
*  He's always even when they suck there still feels like there's a plan Presti is the worst case scenario of this
*  Yeah, all right. We're gonna take a break and then I have more questions for you over under first round bust QB's these guys are busts
*  I'm gonna give you like hard bus like how are we what's like Josh Rosen slash whoever level they're
*  Zach Wilson, maybe they start 30 games, but it just never happens
*  which I think qualifies it if you're if you're taking the top 10 as a QB and
*  You've started under 30 games or under 40 games and you never win it your bus
*  Over under two and a half over under yeah, I'm going under under
*  Yeah, it's a good quarterback class. There's no
*  Lawrence there's no Andrew Luck. There's no like take him with the first overall pick and win games the next 15 years straight to the hall
*  Fame there's no that guy
*  But the four dudes that we have Bryce Young CJ shroud Anthony Richardson and Will Levis are all good prospects
*  All these guys are going before Kenny Pickett last year. So to me, it's a solid class
*  Well, that was my sub question is where would Kenny Pickett have gone because I like Kenny Pickett
*  So you think he's the fifth best QB in this?
*  Would have gotten the Derek Carr Jimmy Garoppolo draft pick if you were in this class that like second round pick
*  Yeah, you know like, you know where he gets through the first round in my opinion now
*  so you're higher on the QB's in this draft and then some others it it's tricky because
*  Like the the class I think it's a little bit miscovered because there's no like star guy you can poke holes in everybody
*  So because you poke holes on everybody to go doesn't look that great. It's still like this is a solid good group
*  You know what I'm saying? Like
*  They were drafting Daniel Jones sixth overall man. Like they've been drafting. Yeah. Yeah, Trey Lance went three
*  Like Josh Allen went seven some very risky quarterbacks are taking very early Mitch Rizvicki
*  They traded up for two, you know saying like yeah, and these guys were imperfect
*  Prospects when they came out let alone but then they make them in the NFL these are imperfect prospects
*  But they're still good quarterback prospect. I think yeah with Bryce Young
*  It's not I don't think it's a matter of is he going to be able to function in the NFL?
*  I think he will be able to the big question is and what you how you've explained it to is
*  How long can he like hold up at that size? There's gonna be being 140 pounds. Yeah, right
*  But I think like processing wise, you know his football character his accuracy all those things
*  He's gonna be I think there's gonna be definitely really exciting moments and he's gonna function in the NFL
*  But just like I said, the question is how long I think with Richardson?
*  He's gonna have enough runway because of the things he can do in the ground game
*  Kind of like what we saw with Jalen hurts like coming into last season
*  There was still major question marks about you heard some people still have question marks about Jalen hurts
*  As a passer, but I still do the thing. Yeah, and the things he can do
*  This up in listen he recruited AJ Brown got a lot better as a passer no further
*  Nice and easy
*  but like so I think he has a runway where he's gonna be he's gonna give get the opportunity and to do some things and
*  like, you know, we had mentioned Justin Fields before the show like
*  He's gonna do enough exciting things to buy himself some time and I don't think he's gonna be like just a flat-out bus
*  Even though he is the most raw and by that I mean like fewest game started of this group
*  So you think he's better than what was that guy named Malik Willis? Yeah. Yeah, it's like a rich man's Malik Willis
*  Yeah, well, this is the thing is like we always like to divide quarterback prospects into just two buckets
*  This is the ready to play bucket. You can start him tomorrow. This is the project bucket
*  He needs a ton of work and which bucket was Mitch Trubisky and there's that's a third bucket the third bucket
*  Which is just why?
*  But the reality is that there's it's a it's a spectrum right like Richardson is a project in the sense that he's underdeveloped
*  He's got accuracy issues like he needs time
*  Like he's only started 12 13 games, but he is remarkably more comfortable in the pocket
*  Remarkably better at manipulating defenses not throwing into the teeth of coverage then like Malik
*  Willis was then Josh Allen was then Trey Lance was that doesn't mean he's gonna follow any one of those three arcs precisely like
*  Landing spot matters a ton
*  but when you watch Richardson you see a guy who's trying to do it the right way and
*  Just needs reps needs needs good coaching needs experience doing it the right way to
*  Build an offense around at least the skill set of being a fucking awesome athlete
*  Yeah, who can run the ball and take off and great pocket management skills, too
*  He's like
*  Richardson has of quarterbacks have come out in the last five six years one of the lowest sack rates on pressures in college in college
*  Well for top prospects just below Patrick Mahomes. This is not Justin Fields Marcus Mario to Daniel Jones where I'm big
*  I'm strong and I run around behind line of scrimmage for 13 minutes. Just making stuff up. He was like buying time
*  You know, he's checking the ball down so he doesn't scramble right and then run out of bounds
*  Exactly listen this and so right that's that's where they get that spectrum of projects comes in where people go
*  Okay, big fast. He hasn't started that much. He's probably kind of crazy back there
*  He isn't he isn't at all if you watch the film be like, all right, this guy gets it
*  We just need to get him over the hump
*  The other thing I will add to this is you're asking now like let's talk about this after we find out what teams they land on
*  Because that to me is the actually I'd sell my soul for Richardson end up with Frank Reich. Oh, I would be so cool
*  It's not gonna happen. I just it's I can't positive. It's not gonna happen. Yeah
*  makes me sad I
*  Just think there it's so so important how teams go about developing these guys what they who they surround them with the continuity of the
*  Coaching staff like those so don't hire Matt Patricia as their offensive coordinator
*  Good like don't theoretical yeah
*  Don't hire defensive coordinator or whatever. Yeah, it's such an important thing
*  Like I really believe you can have a really good
*  Really really good prospect and if he lands in a crappy situation where there's no support. He's not gonna make it and so I
*  Think landing spot is massive. And so where would be like a worst-case scenario landing spot for Richardson, Tennessee
*  Yeah, cuz they don't have yeah any support system. Let's let's let's play a game of named Tennessee offensive lineman
*  Under Dillard's there for some reason start a tackle makes no sense if so, I can't name five Tennessee offensive lineman Nicholas
*  Yeah, I just feel like Houston's a bad landing spot for anybody
*  Yeah, that franchise is a complete mess like they fired a coach like every year. It was like the holiday season
*  It's like Christmas and the Texans fire a coach. Yeah, none of the landing spots are great
*  Like Carolina think is good. Houston's not good Carolina was the best
*  Or supporting cast for somebody to walk in to second in the league in EPA for play, baby
*  I'm still mad. They didn't make the playoffs. They would have thrown some haymakers
*  He did. Yeah. Well, they were
*  Remembered he was Sam Darnold will always have the Lions game. Yeah running on him like crazy
*  But like I don't think he's into landing spot Raiders, Tennessee
*  You're not that good and that's why it's fun to think about like there's you know
*  The Lions have very quietly done their work on this quarterback class
*  Seahawks obviously have met with everybody and someone not mentioned they've taken they've taken their selfies with all their quarterback prospects when they met with them
*  The Vikings have done the work
*  So there's some sneaky teams that you hope Danny wants him at five for his beloved Seahawks in my heart
*  I'm just like MP Carol does the whole I'm so pumped and Jack this guy is a special player
*  We'll move him into our world. I think it's just it's a perfect situation for him
*  Which is why honestly like I would almost rather
*  They take a non quarterback if it's not Richardson
*  Even though I have other guys like I like Bryce and Stroud a little bit more just from like in my rankings
*  I just have them a little bit higher but
*  Richardson landing with the Seahawks where they would be in theory continuity
*  Really strong program and they have good weapons and DK met and lock it yeah
*  And like honestly just it's perfect situation for him because he wouldn't have to start right away
*  Do you know Smith is under contract, but the contract is you can get out of it after a year or two and
*  And yet if they took Jaylen Carter
*  fifth you'd
*  Talk yourself. I would talk about five seconds. I literally like oh awesome verbatim
*  They land me now if they take Carter. I'll talk myself into it, but it is a little bit spooky right now
*  Just because it's not like the NFC East. I'm it's not the NFC is uh I don't know stacked
*  You know the Seattle would you finish 10 and 7 last year?
*  They played a plan right yeah, and then they have a fifth overall pick
*  It's the best situation a team is in besides the Eagles
*  This is so hard though because it's the win forever thing right like he literally wrote a book called win forever
*  It's not let's let's go for it this year. You know they want to build a carol 73
*  He thinks about everything in terms of he doesn't he doesn't he has no plans
*  He's like LeBron him and LeBron of the same guy love Pete. He's got so much energy
*  He has more energy than so you don't neither of you think
*  Richardson's a bust
*  No, I would say the highest bust potential is
*  Young because of injury and because of of size concerns right when you have a small quarterback
*  You're kind of destined to play a certain sort of offense or in certain play style
*  And then young specifically just invite so many hits like the first thing you have to do when young gets in the building is big
*  All right, here's a
*  Highlight reel 30 times you took an unnecessary shot from a Texas defensive lineman
*  You don't get to do this anymore you now are a bajillion dollar face of the franchise
*  Yeah, and everybody here is large you can't do this so I would say it's price Stroud's also up there because Stroud
*  I'm locking in Stroud as a bust. Oh, yeah, the processing yeah, he just what is it just from?
*  Levitating above this which is being unencumbered with my thoughts and baggage
*  Yeah, I'm just like this guy doesn't have it his name's CJ. He's went to Ohio State
*  There's reverse it is a dick CJ is your quarterback. I just don't see it. It's funny. How many great initial quarterbacks of a day, right?
*  It's right. I'm just looking that up. Yeah name
*  Coleridge yeah, his name is Coleridge. Can you name me the great?
*  To two-letter initial quarterbacks AJ feel I immediately go to EJ manual AJ feely
*  Man, it's just I don't see it CJ Bathard. It's like man CJ really came through for us
*  I don't know he just I don't like that he dropped
*  He was like in that one two range and now it's like where's he gonna go like why is he dropping?
*  Everybody's getting under the hood, and they don't like what they see I feel a little busted in me
*  And then Levis is the other one that I mean he feels to me the most likely to
*  AJ McCarran
*  Yeah, that's not a good or a
*  Two initial quarterbacks as I can telling you I'm like Justin Herbert Joe burrow
*  Patrick Mahomes if you say any CJ shroud you say in the voice it sounds better
*  Patrick Mahomes is that great of a quarterback name?
*  I like it too. I don't know. It's Mahomes. He's just become a homes nobody
*  I like when you called him 15. That's yeah, I like when he would just come to number
*  The football guy yeah exactly in draft season. That's what we do
*  We never name players we say their numbers and we say the school they played the kid from Georgia
*  Yeah, that's a 90 if we count Hennan Hooker for the first round bus
*  Yeah, oh yeah that gets me to
*  Yeah, I didn't even think about that I'm going for that one switch answer Trey Lance
*  San Francisco decides we want to trade him for a first-round pick do they get it no
*  No way, no, I can't go first
*  He's been hurt. He hasn't proven anything I second
*  Yeah, I would say I think so I say day two is where you're gonna get it if I'm an NFL team and Kyle
*  Shanahan is trying to get rid of a quarterback the implication being that Kyle couldn't make him work. Yeah
*  39 a half-foot pole I'm out. I don't know though
*  Has his things where he just turns on a player
*  Yeah, we usually
*  He's like benches him for a few weeks puts them in the dark house still a if right if Kyle Shanahan
*  Leading offensive line of our generation is electing Brock Purdy off of a UCL injury and Sam Donald over somebody
*  I am worried about that somebody just sight unseen
*  I think that's I like trail and I didn't love that what we saw before he got hurt last season either the Chicago film
*  He played like the monsoon he like three great exciting throws
*  He had three like terrible throws, and they're trying to figure out what sort of offense they want to run
*  I was like all right like here's the foundation and then he gets injured and at this point like you just can't put eggs
*  in that basket if he's mobility coming off of now multiple lower body injuries just I
*  Do much of a risk that was what we thought he was gonna be when he came out right there was a little bit
*  Because he hadn't played in a year. There's a project element to it. He was lower level
*  Hoker or I think they're born in the same year. They're both born 97. I think he is
*  Trey Lance or Trey Lance over Hendon Hooker by a mile. The head in Trey Lance is 22
*  So if he goes like almost like a full high school
*  That's a great Lamar that's a great Lamar Lamar when he's 25
*  Oh, yeah, hookers gonna be 26 when he starts playing the NFL and he's coming off of an ACL
*  And he was only productive for one year in college in a made-up system. I might go like 29th
*  Yes, they got Robert Griffin the third the Heisman. It's the Baylor offense. It's the most ridiculous for a first-round quarterback
*  I've ever seen he's actually the same age as Sam Darnold. I think and it okay. Yeah, he's five years older than Zach Wilson
*  Why can't Indy we talked about Houston? Why does Indy have to take a QB? What's so special about their season? That's coming up
*  What's looking great for them? Why not just suck again ownership again? I say it's a similar answer
*  I would say it's ownership putting pressure on the general manager
*  Chris Ballard now has had five starting quarterbacks in five seasons and it's not they've won one playoff game
*  I want to say in five years and so yeah
*  The proof of the pudding's in Eaton like you you've been cycling in veterans and it hasn't worked
*  Are you gonna put a six veteran a couple of those veterans?
*  They could have just asked us what we thought and we would have said that's not gonna work Philip Rivers is washed up
*  That's the unfair thing about it is that Ballard now takes heat for like Wentz which really was probably mostly right, but I'm a oh right
*  Yeah, Jim mercer at this point is is I think like what would you have given the odds on the on?
*  Wentz
*  Ryan and Phil Rivers, I
*  Being like multi-round playoff quarterbacks for the Colts
*  I drink the tea on Matt Ryan a little bit
*  I did too I believe because he actually put up numbers the year before and then all of a sudden the arm was gone
*  The age cliff it was well he managed to yeah
*  Ram it up my gambling butthole a couple times with in the beginning that she's game week four. Oh my goodness
*  He had a couple that she said that they had the cheese. That was when the cheese couldn't return a kick
*  He did this thing where he would just suck for two years
*  He did this thing where he would just suck for two and a half hours and then would all of a sudden
*  So irritating is there now I'm thinking about though. Is there any chance they don't take a quarterback?
*  I move is not to take a quarterback
*  Why a new coach get an awesome player?
*  I just want to if I have a top five pick I don't want to come out with a franchise QB or an awesome player
*  But the class is bad. It's bad class which like at four they could get will Anderson Jalen Carter
*  Bichon but be shut back there with Jonathan Taylor. Oh, but like okay put Jalen Carter next to divorce Buckner
*  You're you're walking into next year great starting Sam Allinger and just everybody knows you're dead meat gardeners there Gardner mint you
*  This is my answer everything
*  Although my mint you stock took a hit after that one game. Yeah, I was there with you. What was that one?
*  Well, he played it's a loss they scored like 34 and then the next game he's stuck
*  Yeah, and they're pretty bad. No, I was gonna say just take the best guy and then trade for Lamar
*  I'm I'm always on board with all things that end with and then trade for Lamar that trade for the bar
*  Every team they're the favorite Lamar team other than the Ravens, right?
*  They're high in the odds. The Patriots are high in the odds
*  Falcons are still up there guarantee you the Patriots won't trade for Lamar Jackson. It will never happen. What do you hope the Patriots do?
*  You really want to do they want to do this now?
*  Here's my theory, okay based on
*  some some some birdies
*  Mm-hmm. I don't know if Belchek craft is lasting much longer
*  Okay, and I don't think this will be the year that they trade backwards and oh we got
*  2024 second because we moved back 11 spots. I think it'll be much more aggressive this year
*  I think this could be the could be the beginning of the end
*  And the Mac Jones thing is not awesome craft wanted Zappi to be the starting quarterback
*  second half of the season I there's a lot of weird Mac stuff and
*  I'm just I'm honestly prepared for anything. I might actually Kyle might actually watch the draft of you
*  I know we haven't hung out. We haven't hung out since she made me sick for a week and a half for the rough road
*  But we might have to watch the draft together
*  the
*  I'm just prepared for anything. What do I hope they do? Mm-hmm. I hope they get one of these awesome guys that falls down to
*  14 that sounds great. There's like blue chippers
*  Anderson Wilson Carter Skronsky witherspoon Gonzales Bijan Robinson, right? That's seven. Mm-hmm
*  You figure all of those will go before them, right? It's all is Mike outside the top 10, but everybody else
*  Yeah, they'll go they're gonna get somebody good and then the tight end who I Danny and I both really like
*  I studied him on YouTube for seven minutes. He looks great
*  He looks like a three down tight end which is like how many of those are there?
*  How many three down tight ends are there not Hunter Henry not John New Smith?
*  Seven six. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, if I'm gonna pick pick a tight end the first round
*  I want to make sure they play every down. Mm-hmm. I mean I like friar Muth. I would say it's fucking out
*  He's like fire moves jacked up bonus. Like yeah, like rich man's friar Muth. Yeah, sounds great
*  We're cooking. I just think you don't take first round tight ends in general and this class has just got tight ends
*  I well we agree. Yeah. Yeah, I think you have to look at it like a fantasy draft or
*  How the free agent salary stuff goes you watch any you watch any zay flowers yet?
*  Why do I see you out of Boston College? I'm aware of okay
*  I'm aware. I just want to make sure make sure my dad's right
*  It was on the radar the pace the path met with a like at the shrine bowl at the combine at the local day
*  They brought him in for a visit they've hung out with a flowers many times over the last month
*  I think it's possible and it and I do think I do think they'll go they could go skill position
*  I think knowing Belichick just how he thinks about this shit if
*  Bijan Robinson fell out of the top like eight. I think they would get aggressive. Yeah
*  This is a thing that people are talking about already
*  Does that really move the needle for them a lot though? Yes. Well here so they got Ramadre
*  I'd be a hypocrite because I was the number one Saquon Barkley defending that you got to do this
*  Remember it was him versus Darnold and it was like nobody thinks Darnold's that good take the awesome
*  Transcendent running back and he just got hurt
*  But he's still really good. He's still really valuable. I thought he was a winning player last year
*  Maybe doesn't need to go to but it seems like Bijan Robinson is even more highly thought of than bark who was right?
*  He's on the same. Yeah, it's on the same level. I think are like, yeah, like it's him or Barkley
*  I like him more than Barkley. I don't think he's gonna obviously go that early because we're kind of in a different era
*  There's no dead Gettleman in the league anymore, even though
*  Vindicated Dave Gettleman franchise tag-tag on Barkley extension for Daniel Jones. All right, Dave called it but regardless
*  I think Bijan's more like going I think eight to the Falcons is where you start the clock. I think like that's stupid
*  They can't do that. No, they could do it
*  No, come on
*  Kyle pit see your whole team state about every single one of their skill position players being just way bigger
*  Than all the other teams go. I want to see their whole play. I want to live in this world giant tight end
*  Giant receivers Drake London, Matt Collins. We have already have a big running back with L Patterson
*  Second big running back the quarterbacks and that's a writer baby. My boy terrible. He was not he was okay
*  Yes, he stopped what are you guys talking about settling into NFL speed he was not good
*  There was a second down play action throw against the Saints
*  What's the most fun Bijan Robinson team it's gotta be the Eagles right? Oh, yeah that causes actual riot
*  Yeah, Eagles or bangles if he falls that far, but he's not falling that far
*  No, because there's been some Joe mix and might not be back buzz. Oh, yeah, or like we take a pick-up
*  There's a lot of Alabama running back
*  Gibbs is gonna make it into the first round conversation over the last week
*  And I think the team that's gonna do that is the Bengals there at the end of round one
*  Eagles Bijan is fascinating because everybody immediately says well how we would never take a running back that early
*  How he took miles Sanders at 53 out of Penn State, right?
*  And when you go and you look at where the top of the running back class is going most years like you're Josh Jacobs
*  You're saying one Barclays you're typically seeing
*  Beginning of the second round right? That's where Jonathan Taylor's and your Nick Chubbs and your breeze holes
*  You know JK Dobbins like a lot of general managers analytics oriented guys to start taking right backs in the second round how he is not
*  Historically devalued running back the way like how he's never taken a first round corner ever
*  That's a premium position. So, of course you would know he hasn't done it and running back is taking a round, too
*  So I don't think Bijan's off the table. I do think they're posturing. I think they want Jaylen Carter
*  I think that's that's their whole plan and that's the direction they'd like to go. You can trade up, right?
*  Yeah, that there's there's a lot of Eagles are looking at small trade-ups conversation
*  And I think that's mostly for Jaylen. So the two teams that should unquestionably trade back
*  This is gonna be another one of my questions are Arizona and Vegas Vegas just needs players
*  Mm-hmm, Arizona needs players and they don't care about this here anyway, and they're stuck with quarterback
*  It's not like they can take one because they just gave Kyler all that money
*  so it does feel like
*  Three is probably too high for Jaylen Carter, but seven seven isn't yeah throw them
*  Like what would that be like a hot like a like a third tend to make a future fourth?
*  Yeah, you move up three a couple of men you're doing you're doing a pick like in inside like 40 to 60 40 to 70
*  And then something on top. Um, yeah, it's funny the Cardinals and the Raiders boards are extremely similar because it's Monte awesome for and Dave Ziegler
*  It's just to Patriots cast-off guys. And so it's weird. There's so many great drafts for us. Yeah
*  and it's interesting because
*  Cardinals that we should trade back Raiders have been a trade-up rumor team because people think about them going for a quarterback
*  And when you go to link, okay
*  Who are they trading up with the Cardinals at three of the team that makes the most sense Cardinals move back
*  There's like one of their guys
*  Obviously the GM's know each other and then the Raiders get to whoever the third quarterback is
*  I don't know who the Raiders like it. Why would the Raiders trade up?
*  What would be the point of that that one?
*  To me McDaniel's is a firing possibility if they suck again this year because of well
*  That's why I'll last year played out get a quarterback, right? Yeah, this is this is the one we're like, does that buy them time?
*  They got a quarterback. Yeah, you know, this is the one we're like
*  This is longer like with Houston with Houston. I'm like, I take a quarterback protect the GM's job with Colts
*  I take a quarterback back to GM shop the Raiders long where I'm like stop
*  prove the Josh McDaniel can do anything in terms of like
*  Coaching a team to success and then we'll go and give the guy a guy but I with the Raiders
*  I'm absolutely I wouldn't be doing if I were running the team, but they've looked into the corporate class
*  I they tried to trade up for one overall
*  I like McDaniel's but he had the greatest quarterback of all time the entire time that he succeeded
*  And it's really hard to unhinge that from whatever success he had won an overtime playoff game with Tim Tebow, baby
*  That's that's that's the second
*  Most fun dot dot dot most fun B. John Robinson team is the Eagles. Yeah, what's the backup choice Titans?
*  And that's fine because he's not a shitting
*  It's funny to me because the football nerds be really upset. So that's just exclusive. That's for my enjoyment
*  Falcons are really fun. The most lines
*  lines
*  Well, it would be it would be Falcons are really fun Falcons would be fun
*  They're a lot I would love to see the Falcons with Pitts London and B. John just that would be so elite off the bus team
*  You're looking great walking into the stadium. They're losing by 14 love most fun Richardson team
*  Lions Colts lions no lines lines lines lines lines lines or Seahawks bit, but I'm totally biased on that lines
*  I wouldn't say I don't know if I would do that
*  The lines because I think they have a chance to make the Super Bowl this year with jerk off I do
*  I think I think that conference is weak
*  Did they have a chance Jared golf in the playoffs man? That's fine. Every every quarterback gets hurts for for the 49ers
*  It's just like inevitable. So what is the 49ers?
*  Was like golf is on the Rams dude Brock Purdy was in the NFC title game. Oh, it's the fucking best all bets are off, right?
*  I'm prepared for anything. So I don't know
*  I think the traits if you're just going roster talent Eagles are one who's two in the NFC Dallas
*  I would say San Francisco San Francisco and Dallas and Detroit. That's probably your top four, right?
*  Yeah, I green base got a lot of talent but a lot of it's in like weird spots. Yeah, I was answer top four
*  This is a crazy conference. It's terrible
*  All the good quarterbacks are in the other conference at such an unbelievable precipice for this reason Rogers is out of the division
*  The conference is super weak. They have every piece around quarterback built beautifully wide receiver room good office of line incredible defense improving
*  They have a great DC. They kept Ben Johnson. They're off with the coordinator young off with the coordinator started in the head coaching cycle
*  They said stop interviewing folks come back here staying in Detroit. They gave him a huge contract
*  We have they extended Aaron Glenn. They have got their coordinators in place. Everything is in place
*  They have six and they have 20 if there is a time to go get the quarterback
*  You're never gonna have this good of draft capital again
*  You're gonna be too good. You're gonna be too good. They had 18. They have oh, yes, they have six and 18. Excuse me
*  Yeah, six and 18 is like six is like an impact starter
*  Mm-hmm and 18 is a starter on top of all the other talent they have they need I would go for it
*  I would not take a QB and I thought golf was good last year. I don't know. I think so
*  It makes sense on that team. I'm pro golf. But so let's let's say like
*  Lines are about 500 last year, right and they came around the bend really nicely
*  Let's say they draft Will Anderson at six and they draft
*  defensive tackle Brian Breezy Kalashnikanthi one of these guys at 18
*  They're adding a couple of wins. I I think that's a lot, isn't it? Okay, they win the NFC North
*  I don't think it moves the needle for them up into like the Eagles Cowboys Niners tier
*  Relative and I don't I think you're capped with golf. You would have said that about the Eagles last April
*  So when they the Eagles were plus 200 to win the NFC East remember
*  We knew a little bit less about Jalen Hurts then then we know about Jared Goff now
*  We got data on Jared Goff. You know what I'm saying? Like we I didn't have to push play. Yeah
*  I for me like if I think that we know that was the key
*  Yeah, yeah key
*  I I to me like a team with golf as the starting quarterback is capped and I think that the Lions have to know that this
*  Is there they are never gonna have capital like this again to go get a quarterback
*  I think that they are the team to me that like if they just completely pass on quarterback
*  I just don't love the quarterback. So I'd rather go for the right
*  Problem is is they're probably gonna go take Will Anderson then take Henan Hooker at 18
*  I'm gonna lose my mind
*  I'm gonna be screaming at the television for the next two years trade for Trey Lane trade 18 for Trey Lance
*  Trey Lance is great for the Lions. Everybody's great for the Lions. They have unbelievable pass protection
*  They have a quarterback from the offense. Just get somebody anybody. It's not Jared Goff and Nate Sudfeld
*  definite unquestionable blue chippers, I
*  Think we talked about this, but I just wanted to get this down
*  Anderson Wilson Carter
*  Skowronski witherspoon Gonzalez Bijon Robinson, would you throw the tight end in there?
*  Mmm, I wouldn't say he's a blue chip. I would throw Jackson Smith and jigs in there. I think throw him in
*  I think would you throw him in? I don't think so. I think I think he's a good slot receiver
*  I think some a dark red chipper. Yeah, right with the caliber of receiver talent in the league right now
*  I think you just need more so we only have seven guys then plus however you feel about the quarterbacks
*  Yeah, and that's like its own. Yeah, I would take Tyree Wilson out to for me just he's got injury stuff
*  He's super old. He's 23. He didn't start producing until he was old. He's got some red flags on him
*  But we have them six. Yeah, this is the problem with this draft. There's not a good several blue chippers
*  And then like 70 pretty good play. So Philly should trade up. I
*  Should use tanning try to get it to at least seven, right?
*  Go get Carter and then if they can't they should trade back, right?
*  It's kind of like if you can get up there get up there
*  But if you can't ten is awkward right like their best options is the hang at ten and like Bichon already goes and card already
*  Goes is like take a tackle in case Lane Johnson retires in two years
*  Like that's you know, Peter Skronsky to ride the bench and maybe be the starting guard. Yeah, exactly Eagles got a good roster
*  Go away. Yeah, I would even say like you have Devon Witherspoon. They have the Illinois corner. He's 180 pounds
*  Yeah, you don't see corners this light
*  It's Jire Alexander and Denzel Ward in terms of like top five top ten picks a corner go in this early at this size
*  So it's even like even the the blue chippers in this class got got flags. It is not a strong class
*  It's deep though. Of course. This is the year the pit pats up the 14th pick. It'd be a fun graph
*  All right. So let's end there. Who do the paths take it's really I like her but I
*  Think the path I think the paths I trade up. I think they get will love us. Oh
*  I love that
*  Jesus really just threw that Adam. How high would you have to trade up to?
*  or three
*  Really? Yep, cuz you think he's gonna take them unless the Colts at four have told everybody with an ear
*  We love will love can't wait to take them doesn't that way we're so excited. Not a red flag
*  They went to the New York Jets school of poker
*  We are taking we love Aaron Rodgers. Here's what we would give up
*  Yes, and so I think that if you want will love us you have to own a pick one two three or four
*  You gotta own one of those selections. I think he's gone by four. I kind of I yeah
*  You're probably right, but I'm still I'm just like I'm like will have this is gonna fall a little I
*  Think he's gonna fall NFL loves a will Levis prepares. Well
*  Works hard sounds horrible tough. They are good
*  There's a great NFL Jones was tough
*  There's a great anonymous scout quote where it's like he had to get in NFL play calls in the huddle was great
*  I can speak the language getting the play calls in so it's like the long wordy Shanahan play calls
*  Oh, we love the way he got the play calls in so he just
*  NFL teams literally relayed them. Yes of the play NFL teams do not want to draft NFL quarterbacks
*  They want to draft guys who seem like NFL quarterbacks will Levis just seems like he'd be a good quarterback. I don't know. I just can't
*  I'm still I don't know how to feel about Mac Jones because they just took his second season and covered it in dog shit
*  flushed and had the dumbest worst offensive strategy game to game of any Pats team since I was like in college
*  So it's hard for me to say like oh Mac
*  Like if I was another team I would be trying to trade for Mac Jones because I'm like there might be something here
*  This guy had Matt Patricia's offense coordinator right like the Raiders they signed out
*  What's his face that Jacobi Myers that Kyle loved?
*  He would just catch the ball and get tackled
*  We had no guys on the team that could catch the ball and actually like run an extra five six yards
*  Nelson I have a couple on it could go well he wouldn't even catch it half the time
*  Do you think Stroud is Mac Jonesy a little yeah, yeah
*  I mean, but I would say Mac has better like pocketbook max a little more compacts like quicker release to Stroud is gangly
*  Stroud is Stroud is is souped up golf. I know that's yeah early in the process
*  We were kind of copying him to to golf a little bit and that that's a red flag. Yeah
*  Nothing. I don't think he's got I think he's closer to like a deck Prescott
*  He's just basically not creative Dax creative and I call him to that too. It's just he doesn't
*  Create as much doesn't generate as much offense on his own, but you in your charting. He's super accurate extremely
*  That's the thing you want to be accurate throw the ball to Marvin Harrison jr. You make you look real
*  I know he's got seriously fine adjustments the best collection of college me guys look at all time. Yeah
*  One last point I'm gonna whisper it cuz it's all right
*  Why doesn't Miami need a quarterback?
*  They don't got a pick to get a quarterback. Yeah, yeah Tom Brady, but why are they never mentioned in the teams that might need a quarterback?
*  conversation like to
*  Talked about this multiple times but to it they came out to a thought about retiring after last season like I don't think that's a stable
*  Lock him down for the next five years thing at all
*  They have a good team that they went all in on yeah, and Teddy's a free agent
*  So they have my not good either
*  They brought on Mike White and so right now the room is is to Mike White and Skyler Thompson
*  So technically they have a room
*  They don't like need to add a body like the Lions only have two guys in the room right now
*  They'd like have to draft somebody put him in there Brady's gonna come back. I'm just telling you guys to Miami
*  Brady's coming back to Miami to somewhere. He's coming back. I don't want this Miami
*  Who knows would it like honestly would you bet your life that he wouldn't come back to the pets?
*  I'm gonna bet my life on anything Tom Brady related. Have you seen Brady?
*  I want him to go to get started word here. I want him to go to the Raiders and take grapples job
*  Oh my god, and then have Raiders another possibility for him. That would be funny
*  Yeah, I just feel remember that year when what team tried to get drew Brees to come back in like November
*  With after he retired it was like somebody's QB got her oh
*  Breeze they try to
*  Did they do that with the same thing with Philip Rivers?
*  I just feel like somebody will get hurt and like September October and then the Tom Brady stories will start
*  There's no way he's not throwing every day no way. Yeah, none zero
*  Yeah, right now. He's throwing to some guy in the Bahamas. Just like hold on one more
*  Can you one was calling line doing well? I?
*  Don't think anything's going that well
*  I will say 80 versus Brady was pretty good. Oh, yeah, I forgot a movie my uh my wife and her friends
*  They they all got together and they watched it and they really liked it
*  I thought the preview was an SNL like skit. I thought it was fake when I saw
*  I
*  Thought it was like one of those shorts. Yes, I did too. Yeah, it's it's like totally watchable
*  It's just it's an old actress movie
*  It's like here's a bunch of old actions that have had a lot of plastic surgery, and they're gonna try to go to this Pats game
*  Oh, there is no way you won't enjoy a diversity
*  I can't 100% promise movie connoisseur that I am
*  All right good to see you guys, so we're gonna fill draft show you guys are there a week you're us on the Philly special
*  Yep, and I it's gonna be interesting
*  Interesting week for both of you guys. Yeah, it's a chaos draft
*  Which is a ton of fun, but also very worrisome because you got to be prepared for everything. Yep. Good to see you
*  You too. Thanks
*  You
