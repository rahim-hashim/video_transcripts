# Bill Belichick to UNC? Why the Best NFL Coach Ever Jumped To College | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [December 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=0.0s)]
*  We're taping this on Thursday morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=0.5s)]
*  Seth Wickersham is here from ESPN. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1.8s)]
*  He's popped on here a few times to talk about big picture NFL [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=4.3s)]
*  shenanigans at the coach owner scale and other stuff and the Patriots and Belichick. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=8.2s)]
*  Shockingly to a lot of people goes back to college. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=14.3s)]
*  You wrote about it for ESPN today. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=17.2s)]
*  Uh, I don't really even know where to begin, but I guess I'll start here. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=20.0s)]
*  People see this story, however they feel about Belichick. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=25.8s)]
*  Is my takeaway and I'm just judging it from the people in my life. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=30.2s)]
*  We're emailing about it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=32.9s)]
*  The people who love Belichick thinks he thinks he's a great coach. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=34.0s)]
*  Like I can't believe there was another NFL job for him. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=37.6s)]
*  The people who are done with his style of doing thought he was a little [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=40.4s)]
*  overrated or all like, see the nobody in the NFL wanted him. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=43.6s)]
*  And the truth is the story really hits both sides of that spectrum, right? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=47.0s)]
*  There's no doubt. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=53.2s)]
*  And I think that what makes that interesting is that like that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=54.3s)]
*  reflects a lot of the coach GM and owner divide in the NFL. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=58.1s)]
*  I mean, I think they'd like rank and file coaches, Sean McVay, Kyle [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  Shanahan, Sean Payton, ask any of those guys if they think bill Belichick [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=66.9s)]
*  should be coaching in the NFL and you won't even be able to finish the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=72.6s)]
*  sentence before they say yes. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=76.4s)]
*  Whereas at the GM level though, and the ownership level, there's just so much [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=77.7s)]
*  concern and I think that part of it is his record. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=83.8s)]
*  Part of it is, you know, that for, you know, the last half of the dynasty, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  certainly, you know, Robert Kraft made the secret that he could be [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=93.8s)]
*  impossible to work with at times even as they were winning. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=97.8s)]
*  But I think that there's just a sense that even if Belichick is willing [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=101.4s)]
*  to be deferential to existing infrastructures and existing GMs, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  whoever they might be, there's a sense of like, if you hire this guy, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=109.5s)]
*  you got to kind of let him do it his way and give him the keys, even [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=112.8s)]
*  if he's not technically asking for it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=116.8s)]
*  And I think what changed 2024 has been interesting year for Belichick [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=119.3s)]
*  and we should talk about that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=124.0s)]
*  But what changed I think was that I think that he began to think [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=124.89999999999999s)]
*  maybe I don't really want this and I don't want to take the risk and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=129.2s)]
*  wait in January hoping that I might get one interview and might get one [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=132.5s)]
*  job when I can go to a program that I've got a little bit of history [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=137.6s)]
*  with have the space to win or lose on my terms and in my career that way. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=143.6s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=149.6s)]
*  So there's two major things to unpack there. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=149.9s)]
*  One is how do I even know if I'll get a job in January? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=152.7s)]
*  And then the other piece is how do I know I want the job? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=158.2s)]
*  So let's talk about the league dynamics because I think that's [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=161.7s)]
*  such a big part of this. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=164.4s)]
*  He had such a bad experience with the crafts the last five to seven years [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=165.9s)]
*  really starting with the stuff you were writing about in the mid 2010s [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=170.5s)]
*  that I think and I was one of them a lot of the Patriot fans who had [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=174.1s)]
*  gone through deflate gate and spy gate and then people were starting [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=178.0s)]
*  to write about the dissension between Kraft and Belichick and Brady [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=181.7s)]
*  and all of us were like, fuck you. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=185.0s)]
*  There's no dissension. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=186.2s)]
*  We're fine. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=186.9s)]
*  But then as the years pass clearly there was but I think the crafts [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=188.0s)]
*  thing got so dysfunctional the last five years and if you didn't [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=192.9s)]
*  believe it, you just had to watch the Apple doc, which was one of [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=196.6s)]
*  the most insane pieces of sports content anyone's ever released where [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=199.0s)]
*  it was just an absolute hatchet job that tried to erase Belichick, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=203.0s)]
*  especially from the first three Super Bowls where I don't care where [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=207.6s)]
*  you stand on the Belichick versus Brady thing. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=212.20000000000002s)]
*  Belichick was a bigger reason they won the first three Super Bowls. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=215.0s)]
*  It's a fact the way he put the roster together, the defense he had [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=217.70000000000002s)]
*  the game planning and it was almost like they knew that so they had [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=221.4s)]
*  to steer it toward everything that happened after that and part of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=224.8s)]
*  me wonders was he just so disenchanted with his experience with the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=229.0s)]
*  crafts that as he looked around the available jobs and you see father [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=233.8s)]
*  son duo and competent franchise father son duo and he's just looking [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=238.20000000000002s)]
*  around going that looks awful. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=242.4s)]
*  I was already in that situation. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=244.3s)]
*  Maybe I could have control over my own situation. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=245.70000000000002s)]
*  So just the NFL infrastructure, which you've written about a lot. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=248.9s)]
*  Is it more dysfunctional than we even know about because there's [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=253.1s)]
*  maybe seven franchises that are run smoothly and correctly and then [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=256.1s)]
*  two-thirds of the league at least are kind of a disaster. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=261.2s)]
*  Totally. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=264.6s)]
*  And I think that yeah, it's first of all to go back to like the early [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=265.1s)]
*  part of the dynasty, like, you know, you and I talked about it [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=268.7s)]
*  when my Patriots book came out. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=271.1s)]
*  I mean, those were hugely formative years because Belichick finally [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=272.4s)]
*  had the people the quarterback in place to do what he had had in his [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=277.2s)]
*  mind for so long in terms of like being able to create an actual team [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=282.2s)]
*  and you know, that's where that ethos started and I think that like [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=287.0s)]
*  then Wright Thompson and I and Vanada reported on it a year ago or so [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=292.7s)]
*  that, you know, Belichick really felt like the crafts had eroded what [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=297.9s)]
*  he had built in the past couple years. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=301.9s)]
*  Crafts, of course, were pissed off that he let Brady walk out and, you [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=304.5s)]
*  know, he told Craft that Brady couldn't play anymore and he goes [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=308.3s)]
*  wins the Super Bowl. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=311.7s)]
*  But then, yeah, 2024, he gets fired by the Crafts, even though they [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=313.2s)]
*  call it a mutual parting of ways, Craft later comes out and says that, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=318.5s)]
*  you know, he was fired. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=322.0s)]
*  Well, and he was also telling everyone in NFL circles like, yeah, I [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=323.4s)]
*  fired him. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=326.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=327.09999999999997s)]
*  And then you have seven openings and only one team shows any interest [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=328.09999999999997s)]
*  in him. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=333.3s)]
*  He meets with the owner twice and then the next thing you know, you [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=333.90000000000003s)]
*  know, he's voted off the island as we reported about and... [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=338.0s)]
*  You're talking about Atlanta. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=340.90000000000003s)]
*  Atlanta. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=342.5s)]
*  And like he was willing to work with GM Terry Fontenot. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=343.7s)]
*  He was willing to work with Rich McKay, even though there's a lot of [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=346.90000000000003s)]
*  history there. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=349.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=350.7s)]
*  But, you know, at the end of the day, they not only went with Raheem [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=352.6s)]
*  Morris, but they made a decision against Belichick, like didn't finish [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=356.2s)]
*  in any of the decision-makers top three candidates. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=360.1s)]
*  And they leaked it too to make them look bad, which I thought was [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=363.2s)]
*  really interesting. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=366.7s)]
*  It was our reporting. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=367.9s)]
*  I mean, it's a little bit different than they leaked it, but yeah, we [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=368.7s)]
*  learned about it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=370.8s)]
*  Well, true, you're right. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=371.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=371.7s)]
*  But you're reporting it, you're finding out that they weren't in the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=372.5s)]
*  top three. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=375.8s)]
*  So they're telling somebody. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=376.4s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=377.09999999999997s)]
*  So he gets shut out. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=378.59999999999997s)]
*  Then you have the dynasty comes out, which just, you know, really [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=380.7s)]
*  roundly dismisses his influence, you know, in that team's historic run. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=384.7s)]
*  So start this season. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=391.3s)]
*  He's got his media gigs, but every week he and a lot of the old [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=392.7s)]
*  Patriots assistants who are also out of work would do these Zooms. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=396.59999999999997s)]
*  And they would get, go through every team, every game, every situation, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=399.9s)]
*  these high level conversations. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=403.9s)]
*  And I think the subtext of it all was like what teams and organizations [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=406.4s)]
*  sound good for us if the situation comes up. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=411.0s)]
*  And there wasn't a lot of back channel communication with owners. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=415.0s)]
*  I think that the Brian Forrest lawsuit has impacted that greatly. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=418.4s)]
*  Can you explain that? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=422.7s)]
*  Cause that's such a crucial piece of this. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=423.7s)]
*  So like five years ago, there's texting, there's, Hey, what's going on [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=425.4s)]
*  over there and you're just back channeling constantly and the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=430.5s)]
*  florist thing just completely ended that. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=432.9s)]
*  Well, it's an ongoing discrimination lawsuit against the league and [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=435.9s)]
*  three teams. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=438.5s)]
*  And I think that owners, you know, don't want to get wrapped up in that. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=439.09999999999997s)]
*  They don't want to be part of that. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=442.59999999999997s)]
*  They don't want to violate the Rooney rule. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=444.0s)]
*  And so I'm not convinced that Belichick wouldn't have ended up with an NFL job. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=446.9s)]
*  I just think we're never going to know. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=450.9s)]
*  And I think that the ones that he thought he might have a chance at [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=453.09999999999997s)]
*  just didn't seem appealing enough. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=457.5s)]
*  And I think that like on those zoom calls midway through the season, all of [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=459.3s)]
*  a sudden the college game just seemed much more appealing to him and he [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=463.3s)]
*  wanted to discuss certain programs. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=466.7s)]
*  How would would work if they tried to implement some of the [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=468.4s)]
*  Patriot way at that level. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=471.4s)]
*  And again, I was as shocked as anybody. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=474.09999999999997s)]
*  I think you and I were texting about it when North Carolina, you know, came up. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=476.9s)]
*  I, and you know, it's not Notre Dame exactly, but he felt like this is a [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=481.0s)]
*  good place to end his career the way that he wants to end his career, which [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=486.1s)]
*  is, you know, working with people that he cares about that he likes and [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=490.0s)]
*  when you're losing on his terms. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=494.5s)]
*  Well, and he has a little bit of a father legacy with them. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=496.40000000000003s)]
*  It's a great place to live. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=499.70000000000005s)]
*  It's a place that seems like they were willing to give them the car keys. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=501.70000000000005s)]
*  I want to go through those NFL jobs though, because it's such, such a [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=504.90000000000003s)]
*  crucial piece of this. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=508.5s)]
*  Because there's going to be a narrative like, ah, the league rejected him. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=510.20000000000005s)]
*  And, and you know, even your piece tapped into that. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=513.9s)]
*  Did Belichick reject the league first or they already reject him. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=516.8000000000001s)]
*  If you go through the jobs, Las Vegas, assuming that becomes open after the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=520.4s)]
*  year, I mean, they have two wins, but I'm just guessing. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=526.4s)]
*  Well, Mark Davis fired McDaniels. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=529.3000000000001s)]
*  He's a legacy kid. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=531.3000000000001s)]
*  Um, that's a franchise that's never, I would say been stable the last decade. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=533.1s)]
*  So he's not going there. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=538.5s)]
*  Jacksonville. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=540.1s)]
*  Which is my thought. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=541.3000000000001s)]
*  I don't, I don't think he, I think consistently he really didn't want to go out west. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=542.4s)]
*  Well, and also they don't have a quarterback. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=547.5s)]
*  There's so many variables to cross them up. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=549.4s)]
*  Jacksonville is the team I thought made the most sense, but what do they have? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=551.9s)]
*  They have the father son duo who's been pretty incompetent over the last 10 years. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=555.4s)]
*  Like he just dealt with that with the crafts. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=560.0s)]
*  Now he's getting the more incompetent version of the crafts. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=562.2s)]
*  Trevor Lawrence, you'd have to really talk yourself into. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=565.8000000000001s)]
*  Um, and it would have to be a situation where they just gave him everything, but [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=568.5999999999999s)]
*  they've already proven they don't really work that way. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=573.6999999999999s)]
*  The son runs the analytics department and it just seems like that wasn't a match. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=575.5999999999999s)]
*  So cross them off. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=580.0s)]
*  New Orleans, no quarterback, the Benson family. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=580.8s)]
*  They're a mess. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=583.5999999999999s)]
*  He's not going there. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=584.8s)]
*  They're in Capel. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=585.5999999999999s)]
*  You can't succeed there. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=586.6999999999999s)]
*  That makes no sense. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=587.6999999999999s)]
*  Cross them up. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=588.5999999999999s)]
*  The Jets, no quarterback and he can't stand Woody Johnson. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=589.5s)]
*  Took shots at him constantly all the way during the season and all his media places. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=592.8s)]
*  So cross them off. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=597.5s)]
*  The giants were interesting because I thought that was another possibility, but [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=599.0s)]
*  it's pretty clear that he really likes day ball. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=602.9s)]
*  And even in, in some of the reporting was like telling them like, you guys need a [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=605.9s)]
*  better front office, but you have a good coach. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=610.7s)]
*  He just didn't want to shank day ball. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=612.8s)]
*  So that's out. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=614.2s)]
*  Plus they don't have a QB. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=614.9s)]
*  Dallas. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=617.4s)]
*  We won't know until January, right? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=619.3s)]
*  That's another father son duo by the way, but won't know until January. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=621.3s)]
*  And he didn't want, he couldn't wait that long because this North Carolina job was [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=625.7s)]
*  either going to be there or not. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=628.8000000000001s)]
*  So let that one go. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=629.8000000000001s)]
*  And then the only other one I can think of before the one that you talked about in [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=631.5s)]
*  your piece, Cincinnati, if this ended badly, they didn't make the playoffs and [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=635.8000000000001s)]
*  they fire Zach Taylor, who has not covered himself in glory this year. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=641.7s)]
*  That's a really good job because you have Burrow, Ohio, I get, you know, but [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=645.4000000000001s)]
*  again, you can't wait till January. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=650.2s)]
*  So the only one that really might've made sense was Chicago. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=651.8000000000001s)]
*  And in your reporting, they seemed receptive to that one, right? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=656.0s)]
*  But Chicago is just, they want one of those offensive Wiz kid play out play callers. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=659.9000000000001s)]
*  Everybody has been Johnson linked to them already. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=664.0s)]
*  So it just didn't seem like a fit. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=666.3000000000001s)]
*  That was the one team that seems like they've rejected him. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=667.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=672.1s)]
*  And I mean, again, what, what are those situations is interesting. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=672.5s)]
*  I mean, that Dallas is interesting to me because nobody can take a collection of [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=675.8000000000001s)]
*  talent and turn them into a team quite like Belichick, but again, you know, can [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=680.6s)]
*  the Jones share the spotlight with someone like Belichick? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=685.7s)]
*  Um, you know, I've no doubt that they could all get along, but I don't know if [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=688.7s)]
*  Jerry Jones values coaches enough to, you know, go after someone like Bill. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=692.6s)]
*  And so Jason Garrett for eight years or nine years. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=697.4s)]
*  So we know the answer to that already. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=700.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=702.2s)]
*  And so I think that like, again, you know, he, he saw the giants as a rebuild, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=702.9s)]
*  but he also believes that Brian Dayball has done a good job. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=707.8s)]
*  And so it was like, you take yourself out of the running for that. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=710.5999999999999s)]
*  If they were even considering it. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=713.9s)]
*  And, um, you know, again, this is all just, I think that like, and even Cincinnati, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=715.5s)]
*  I mean, remember when he would go on his podcast or on the McAfee show, I mean, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=721.3s)]
*  he was really critical of burrow. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=726.1999999999999s)]
*  And usually when he does that publicly, you know, that there's a lot more there. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=729.0s)]
*  Um, in terms of his prague, scouting report of a certain player. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=734.0s)]
*  So we devouring some of the Belichick media stuff, try it. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=738.5s)]
*  Cause you know him so well. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=741.6s)]
*  And you know, the trying to just like the little breadcrumbs he was dropping [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=742.9000000000001s)]
*  one way or the other, was that like a sport for you? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=747.0s)]
*  I loved it. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=749.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, it was, it was, it was really fun. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=750.9000000000001s)]
*  It was really fun. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=753.4000000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's all we've wanted, right? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=754.2s)]
*  Because what you, what you have is the, you know, for all these decades, you [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=755.7s)]
*  knew, you know, you had his, his, his public performance. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=760.4000000000001s)]
*  Which was very buttoned up. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=763.7s)]
*  And then the things you would learn about what they were like behind the scenes [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=766.2s)]
*  and the way that they would really, you know, put so much thought into [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=771.3000000000001s)]
*  like all these decisions. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=776.9000000000001s)]
*  It was just mind blowing. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=778.1s)]
*  And so I loved like just getting a glimpse of that this year from him. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=779.9000000000001s)]
*  And especially like his disdain for certain things was really funny. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=783.6s)]
*  Like sloppy special teams just like really, really cut into the, to the heart. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=787.3000000000001s)]
*  I interviewed, I interviewed, I, I was talking with Peyton Manning earlier [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=793.0s)]
*  this year for my quarterbacks book. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=797.3s)]
*  And, you know, he was talking about how Belichick just loves coming on the [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=800.1s)]
*  Manning cast and loves watching punts. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=803.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=809.4s)]
*  Like Belichick, if there was a punt near the end zone and the guy screwed it up [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=809.6s)]
*  and fell into the end zone, it was like Belichick was being electro shocked on [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=814.2s)]
*  the sidelines. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=818.7s)]
*  It was, it was the worst thing that could happen to him as somebody's [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=819.3s)]
*  screwing up a basic play. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=822.5s)]
*  And then you watched him when we had an Atlanta game and I think he was on the [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=824.4s)]
*  Manning cast and you know, he's just ripping them for sloppy tackling and [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=827.8s)]
*  things like that. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=832.1s)]
*  And you know, that was a job obviously they made a point of making sure [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=832.8s)]
*  everyone knew why they didn't hire him. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=836.7s)]
*  And so, you know, I enjoyed that stuff quite a bit. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=838.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=842.3s)]
*  He seemed like he had an axe to grind against Atlanta. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=842.5s)]
*  The Jets, he couldn't take the Witty Johnson shots enough. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=845.5s)]
*  There are a couple others, but you know, I'm torn on this. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=848.8s)]
*  Because I really thought him trying to be the coach GM everything the [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=852.4s)]
*  last couple of years, which just wasn't sustainable anymore. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=857.5s)]
*  And he wasn't good at it. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=861.0s)]
*  The free agent draft stuff the last five years, he was just bad. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=862.4s)]
*  And you could see the results in the roster. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=866.6s)]
*  He just didn't do a very good job. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=868.8s)]
*  And I, and that combined with, I think he had a lot of trouble replenishing [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=870.6s)]
*  assistance. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=876.1s)]
*  Once guys got plucked left and right, that becomes really hard to just keep [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=877.6s)]
*  replenishing these guys that you kind of taught your whole system to you get [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=883.6999999999999s)]
*  older, you don't have the same kind of motor. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=887.1999999999999s)]
*  So, you know, I, the way he did it in the two thousands, no chance he was [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=889.8s)]
*  going to be able to do that again, but I still feel like he was a pretty good, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=895.1s)]
*  a pretty like top, maybe not top seven coach, but in the top 10. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=898.8s)]
*  What was interesting about last year, the team got sloppy in ways that were [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=904.1s)]
*  really uncharacteristic for Belichick. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=907.9000000000001s)]
*  And I do think people around the league probably noticed that this wasn't [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=910.4000000000001s)]
*  like the same buttoned up overachieving thing. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=913.3000000000001s)]
*  Now their defense overachieve and finished like I think sixth and DVO way. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=916.1s)]
*  Some of that had to do with the schedule. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=920.4000000000001s)]
*  Some of that had to do with when you're playing a shit team, you're not [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=922.3000000000001s)]
*  necessarily throwing the kitchen sink at them. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=926.6s)]
*  You're just trying to get through the game. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=928.4000000000001s)]
*  Um, a little, some of it was smoke and mirrors, but at the same time, the team [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=930.5s)]
*  did overachieve, they were awful offensively. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=933.9s)]
*  They couldn't have been worse. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=936.3s)]
*  And the reason I bring this up is the irony of all of this is the best job for [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=938.3s)]
*  him, I think would have been the Patriots for 2025 with like some pieces [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=942.8s)]
*  desperately needed, like a stable hand and they have an awesome quarterback. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=948.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=953.1s)]
*  Which is the thing he didn't have for six years. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=953.4s)]
*  And the funniest thing about all of this is that was the perfect job for him, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=955.4s)]
*  but it never would happen. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=958.5s)]
*  Never would have happened. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=960.2s)]
*  So there was definitely no chance. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=961.2s)]
*  Um, and you know, I think that. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=962.8s)]
*  Although Ben and JLo happens. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=966.0s)]
*  So maybe, maybe there's maybe no chance is too strong. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=967.5s)]
*  There have been reunions that have been shut. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=971.4s)]
*  The Eagles got back together, but that one would have been an [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=973.3s)]
*  all time shocker, I think. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=975.7s)]
*  I know I'm trying to think if there's, I mean, you just look at the toxicity. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=978.5s)]
*  Of how that ended. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=983.6s)]
*  And I don't know if there's a sports parallel where they could have like mended [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=984.7s)]
*  that again. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=988.4s)]
*  I mean, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=990.0s)]
*  Phil Jackson, Jerry Krauss, the only thing I was thinking about that. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=990.9s)]
*  And that wasn't going to. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=994.6999999999999s)]
*  I mean, it was, it's, it got pretty bad. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=996.8s)]
*  I mean, you saw the body language at the press conference when they let [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=998.9s)]
*  Balachek go, you saw it at the Brady roast. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1002.3s)]
*  The roast was the best. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1004.9s)]
*  He was, he just had complete disdain. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1006.0s)]
*  You can, he couldn't hide it. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1007.9s)]
*  Couldn't hide it. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1009.8s)]
*  And, um, yeah, I mean, I'm with you like on paper in terms of like, if you're [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1010.9s)]
*  looking at the situation that's kind of best suited for him, where you're taking [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1015.8s)]
*  a team that, you know, again, needs to kind of like come together and play [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1019.8s)]
*  smarter, that might be, you know, the Patriots might be a sport, but yeah, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1023.5999999999999s)]
*  that was never going to happen this year. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1027.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1029.3s)]
*  Cause you look like Sean Payton, they give him the car keys in Denver, turns [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1029.5s)]
*  it around now he's younger than Belichick. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1033.5s)]
*  Harbaugh with the Chargers this year, same, same thing. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1035.3s)]
*  Like there's probably seven, eight guys that could do that. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1038.0s)]
*  But in those cases, those guys are also running a lot of the front office thinking. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1042.1000000000001s)]
*  And I think Belichick with his last five years, probably lost that with the [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1049.1000000000001s)]
*  perfect job would have been, Hey, we have a good team. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1052.5s)]
*  We ran our course with our coach. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1056.8000000000002s)]
*  Can you just come in? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1058.5s)]
*  That's why Philly became super interesting in September for a couple of [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1059.6000000000001s)]
*  weeks there when it looked like Sirianni was going to go badly. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1064.0s)]
*  And that was like, whoever's taken that one, that's like a hired gun job. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1066.5s)]
*  Could he just come in hired gun? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1070.1000000000001s)]
*  Hey, just try to win as many games as possible, compete for titles. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1072.4s)]
*  But then Philly turned it around. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1075.4s)]
*  They won nine to 10 games. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1077.3s)]
*  So it makes sense to me that he did this because I do think he just wants to coach [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1078.5s)]
*  and, and maybe he started to realize the NFL isn't for him now, on the other hand, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1084.9s)]
*  could he do this for two years and then realize, Oh, that job's open. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1090.5s)]
*  And all of a sudden he's hopping back. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1095.6000000000001s)]
*  Do you think the Shula records important to him? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1097.3s)]
*  Because I've heard different, different takes on this. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1099.2s)]
*  I think it is important, but it's not the thing, you know, it's not why [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1104.3s)]
*  he gets out of bed in the morning. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1107.4s)]
*  It's not what really motivates him. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1108.7s)]
*  And I think that like probably given a year off, you know, he was able to [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1111.4s)]
*  reflect a little bit on like, what are the essential things that I enjoy about this job? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1116.8s)]
*  And I think that like, you know, one of the things with the New York Giants, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1122.0s)]
*  let's say he had gone there and he knows that it's going to take a year to get that team back. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1126.0s)]
*  He would have been going through his third straight coaching year. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1131.7s)]
*  So 22, 23, and then next year with, you know, the media on him and whether he's [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1135.9s)]
*  lost his fastball, a daily, you know, piece of speculation and content. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1145.7s)]
*  And I don't think he really wanted to deal with that. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1150.2s)]
*  And I think that like, it's one of the college football media is a little [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1152.9s)]
*  different than the NFL. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1156.8000000000002s)]
*  And I think that like, even though it's intense in its own ways, like that's [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1159.9s)]
*  something that he won't really have to contend with, I think when he's in North Carolina. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1163.3000000000002s)]
*  So the things working against him, the crafts poisoned the well, GM performance [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1170.5s)]
*  last five to six years was just bad. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1175.3000000000002s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1178.5s)]
*  A known curmudgeon, which he tried his hardest over this with the eight [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1179.0s)]
*  media jobs he had to really try to prove that he wasn't. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1183.3999999999999s)]
*  And I'm in the camp that he's probably more entertaining than a curmudgeon. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1186.5s)]
*  But I think if, if, if he's working for you and you're just a rich guy who wants [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1190.1s)]
*  answers, he's going to be a curmudgeon. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1196.1s)]
*  Um, brings a lot of like people that come with him. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1198.2s)]
*  Some would say they're cast offs. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1204.1s)]
*  Some would say there are people that if it was for Belichick would not be [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1205.8s)]
*  working in the league anymore, but he has a lot of those people. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1208.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1211.2s)]
*  And the irony of it is, um, this is the same kind of thing. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1211.5s)]
*  He probably despises with owners. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1215.4s)]
*  Like, why do I have to deal with your family? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1218.3s)]
*  Why do I have to deal with your, you know, now your son's telling me what to do. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1219.9s)]
*  But this North Carolina situation is going to, he's going to be in, he's going [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1223.1000000000001s)]
*  to bring a lot of like his family with him, including actual family members. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1227.3s)]
*  So, and I, I, I, but it seems like to me, that was probably a huge piece of this [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1231.8s)]
*  for him, just working with people that he trusts and likes, right? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1237.2s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1241.0s)]
*  And I think that like, that was something that a year ago when the Eagles, you [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1241.5s)]
*  know, were at, at, at the highest levels, we're talking about, Hey, look, you know, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1246.5s)]
*  he's available. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1251.4s)]
*  Do we, do we make a move here? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1252.1s)]
*  You know, that was one of the things that was considered is that like, even [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1254.5s)]
*  though those group of minds for the longest time were just like so desired in [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1259.5s)]
*  NFL circles, right? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1264.5s)]
*  I mean, owners just could not wait to try to tap into his thinking until they [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1265.5s)]
*  realize, you know, that it's, it's so singular. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1268.8s)]
*  His system is not a playbook like Bill Walsh's. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1272.0s)]
*  It's literally his decision-making in real time. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1274.3s)]
*  You know, he did, they thought, you know, he doesn't necessarily have the best [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1279.1s)]
*  record of developing coaches. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1283.3999999999999s)]
*  And considering if he comes in, you have to kind of let him run it his way. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1285.8999999999999s)]
*  Are you doing this again in two years? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1291.7s)]
*  Are you blowing up the building again? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1293.7s)]
*  Or do you give someone a third shot at being, you know, a head coach or, you [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1295.6s)]
*  know, one of the people out of that group, a second shot of being a head coach. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1300.1s)]
*  And so those things were definitely on. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1303.3s)]
*  Mine's I think that like with Belichick, just him having been in the NFL for [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1305.6s)]
*  half a century now and been in the public eye really for most of the last [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1310.6s)]
*  30 or so years is that there's just enough material out there that if you [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1316.4s)]
*  want to lay out a convincing conversation as to why you don't want to hire him, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1321.0s)]
*  it's there. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1325.3s)]
*  But his record is also there. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1327.0s)]
*  And I mean, just imagine him going through what he went through last January [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1330.1s)]
*  and February and then having to go on his podcast and on the McAfee show [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1335.5s)]
*  and everything and explain to us and him trying to do it politely just how [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1341.8s)]
*  stupid some of the coaching is in the NFL. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1348.5s)]
*  I mean, when they have to bring him on to explain what happened at the end [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1350.8s)]
*  of the Bears Lions game. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1354.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1356.4s)]
*  And I mean, you know, this is stuff that he knows how to do in his sleep. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1356.7s)]
*  I mean, he is the one who with the clock, you know, melting down against [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1360.3s)]
*  the Seahawks saw confusion saw personnel change calls, you know, go line [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1364.1s)]
*  three. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1369.8999999999999s)]
*  I think that was the name of it. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1370.1999999999998s)]
*  Butler goes in all that stuff comes together in a way that I can't ever see [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1371.8s)]
*  being replicated again so much preparation and thought and execution [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1376.6s)]
*  and don'ts for lack of a better word. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1381.0s)]
*  And yet, you know, you're watching these coaches screw up game situations [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1384.1999999999998s)]
*  all the time and they bring him on to try to explain why and these are the [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1388.8s)]
*  guys who have jobs right now. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1392.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1395.5s)]
*  Well, this NBA has the same problem. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1396.6s)]
*  Most if you have between those two, there's 62 franchises, NBA NFL, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1400.1s)]
*  probably three fourths of them are terrible at hiring coaches and in the [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1406.6999999999998s)]
*  NBA coaches just change all the time. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1411.1s)]
*  The NFL coaches change all the time. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1413.3999999999999s)]
*  We see situations like last year where Iber fluce clearly, you know, that [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1415.6999999999998s)]
*  was going to be risky to bring him back with the new QB that could have [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1421.4s)]
*  gone either way. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1424.6000000000001s)]
*  Salah looked like he'd already run his course with the Jets. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1425.7s)]
*  They talked themselves into bringing him back. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1428.3000000000002s)]
*  But a lot of the times you can kind of see it just from not being attached [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1430.1000000000001s)]
*  just from watching your TV being like, and that guy seems like a man like [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1436.6000000000001s)]
*  Brandon Staley last year. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1439.9s)]
*  It's like like this. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1441.8000000000002s)]
*  There's no way there's no path out of this. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1443.3000000000002s)]
*  So I'm sure Belichick watches that too. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1446.0s)]
*  And he's like, are you fucking kidding me? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1448.2s)]
*  Like really? [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1449.7s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1451.0s)]
*  And I think a year ago, I think it was a year ago, there was a, you know, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1451.6s)]
*  they have owners meetings and then they have the privilege meeting, which is [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1455.3999999999999s)]
*  just owners and you know, maybe they're family members, but it's not team [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1458.5s)]
*  executives. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1463.2s)]
*  And I think that it was in a privilege session where the league presented some [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1464.3999999999999s)]
*  data as to the total amount of money that owners are paying coaches that are [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1468.3999999999999s)]
*  no longer working for them. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1473.5s)]
*  And it was a staggering amount. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1475.1s)]
*  And you know, then it prompted all this discussion about the value of coaches [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1477.4s)]
*  are we paying these guys too much all this stuff. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1480.5s)]
*  But the bottom line is that like most owners are not good at this. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1482.5s)]
*  And even if you're invested in a GM, like I don't want to pick on him, but [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1486.8s)]
*  let's just say Terry Fontenot or what, whoever it might be. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1491.3s)]
*  Why not tell why not have an owner who says, look, I'm going to keep [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1495.3s)]
*  you around. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1499.8s)]
*  I want you to absorb as much as you can from this guy while we have two to [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1501.0s)]
*  three years with him so that we can take the best pieces going forward after [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1504.3999999999999s)]
*  he sets the record and you know, rides off into the sunset. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1507.5s)]
*  Like that would be some really strategic thinking on an owner's part. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1510.8999999999999s)]
*  And yeah, but Seth, you know how this works. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1515.2s)]
*  These the rich guys just call each other. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1517.7s)]
*  And then, you know, they weirdly look out for each other, even though they're [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1520.8999999999999s)]
*  all competing against each other in this league and there's no way that [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1524.8s)]
*  Arthur Blank didn't call Kraft to ask for his take on Belichick. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1528.6s)]
*  I just refuse to believe he didn't. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1531.6s)]
*  And there's no way Kraft didn't give him a bad review. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1533.3s)]
*  So then if you're playing on it, yeah, you hit, yeah, you have this, if you're [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1536.1999999999998s)]
*  blank, you have a franchise that's worth $7 billion and you're trying to [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1540.1s)]
*  think, do I want to give the car keys to the $7 billion franchise to this [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1545.1999999999998s)]
*  guy and his last employer is just absolutely like smashing them. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1548.8999999999999s)]
*  You're going to hesitate and you're going to go to the yes, man. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1554.6s)]
*  Cause this is the other thing Lombardi and I talked about this when he was [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1557.1999999999998s)]
*  on, I think in August, September, you have a lot of people in these [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1559.6s)]
*  organizations and I've dealt with this professionally to job protection [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1563.3s)]
*  people that their job is just to keep their own job and they're always going [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1567.1999999999998s)]
*  to like push blame on other people and undermine other people because that's [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1572.3999999999999s)]
*  how they're going to keep their seat. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1576.0s)]
*  And that happens in so many of these football. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1577.8s)]
*  They, we just saw it happen with the Falcons. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1580.1999999999998s)]
*  The cousins, Penex thing is probably a disaster, right? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1581.8999999999999s)]
*  Are there going to be repercussions for it? [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1585.8s)]
*  They're just going to blame other people. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1587.3s)]
*  Well, cousins, he didn't tell us he was helping them. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1588.6s)]
*  They'll, they'll figure out how to blame and keep going. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1591.1999999999998s)]
*  Rob Polinka is the master of this with the Lakers. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1593.0s)]
*  They fire coach every year they trade. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1595.6999999999998s)]
*  They've traded all their picks. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1598.3999999999999s)]
*  They've done everything, but somehow everybody else gets blamed for it. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1599.6s)]
*  So I just think that's such a big part of sports now. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1602.5s)]
*  And I don't think the common person who just roots for football like sees it. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1605.3999999999999s)]
*  And owners, you bring up two interesting points. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1610.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean, number one is that a lot of them are kind of risk averse and [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1613.5s)]
*  conflict averse, which I think, you know, within that context, it makes you [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1616.5s)]
*  realize just, you know, how, um, ballsy it was for Robert Kraft to trade a [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1622.3s)]
*  first round pick for Belichick back in 2000. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1629.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1631.2s)]
*  Which is his hall of fame case, by the way, it's like, he not only hired [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1631.5s)]
*  Belichick, he traded a first round pick. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1634.9s)]
*  He was that convinced in the guy. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1636.5s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1638.4s)]
*  And then the thing is though, is that you're right. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1639.1s)]
*  I mean, like group think takes over. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1642.5s)]
*  Like even though these guys are, you know, in charge of these [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1644.1s)]
*  multi-billion dollar, um, businesses, and even though they're all bosses in [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1648.1s)]
*  their own right of whatever other businesses they might own, like when you [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1653.3s)]
*  see votes taken in the NFL, there's not a lot of close votes, like they're almost [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1657.6s)]
*  always like 31 to one, Mike Brown never votes, you know, whatever it might be. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1663.1s)]
*  Like group think does just take over. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1667.5s)]
*  And I think that like, you know, like we said, they can, they can use [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1669.6999999999998s)]
*  whatever excuse they want for why they don't want to hire a Belichick, but [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1674.6s)]
*  it doesn't look good for all of them. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1680.6999999999998s)]
*  It doesn't look good that this guy left and went to college to a mid-level [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1682.1999999999998s)]
*  program, um, while we're watching just like so much bad coaching every week. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1685.8999999999999s)]
*  Well, I don't think it's a mid-level program anymore with the kind of money [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1692.6999999999998s)]
*  they're probably spending. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1696.3s)]
*  I think that for North Carolina, you always have to look like why would [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1697.7s)]
*  somebody do, why would somebody spend? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1701.0s)]
*  I don't know how much it's 30 for three. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1703.3000000000002s)]
*  I saw 50 for five, whatever it is. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1705.1000000000001s)]
*  Plus all the other people in Belichick's life, plus the commitment to [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1707.0s)]
*  NIL, it's probably like a, I don't know, 40 to $50 million commitment per year. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1710.2s)]
*  But when was the last time anyone talked about North Carolina football? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1716.9s)]
*  Like we just got Drake May from them. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1720.1000000000001s)]
*  And all I read about leading up to Drake May is like, we have no idea how [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1722.5s)]
*  good he is because his team was such dog shit in this last year, right? [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1726.4s)]
*  That's who you're getting. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1730.3000000000002s)]
*  Um, they, so this writer named Olly Conley, who's, I think does a good job. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1731.6000000000001s)]
*  And he was on some of the reporting on this, but he wrote a piece today [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1737.1000000000001s)]
*  about, uh, about when Bill Walsh went back to Stanford and how badly it went. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1739.6000000000001s)]
*  And it went badly for a bunch of different reasons. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1745.7s)]
*  College football was totally different back then. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1748.2s)]
*  Walsh maybe didn't have the stamina or the motor that he thought he did. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1750.7s)]
*  He tried to bring an NFL mindset and it just went badly. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1755.3s)]
*  There was a book written about it. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1758.6000000000001s)]
*  And, you know, I've been really like Stuart Mandela, the athletic wrote a [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1760.7s)]
*  piece, like, this is going to be a disaster. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1765.1000000000001s)]
*  Like he was just like, mark my words, come back here in two years. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1767.3s)]
*  This is going to be a disaster. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1770.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't know whether I'm just like a Belichick junkie at this point or a [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1773.1000000000001s)]
*  Belichick apologist, I don't know. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1777.2s)]
*  I just, I watched him do so many great things. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1779.4s)]
*  I just really find it hard to believe he's going to go to college and not be [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1782.4s)]
*  good and yet the track record said he won't, it says that he won't be good. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1785.4s)]
*  So where do you stand? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1789.8000000000002s)]
*  My gut tells me he'll do pretty well there. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1793.2s)]
*  Now, look, I don't know what that means. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1795.4s)]
*  You know, does that mean they make the playoffs? [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1797.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't exactly know, but I think when you have a legend who still feels [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1799.5s)]
*  like he has something to prove and, you know, is really sharp, I think [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1807.6s)]
*  history usually lends itself pretty, pretty well to those guys. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1813.0s)]
*  And I think that clearly this was a space that in 2024 really just started to [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1815.8999999999999s)]
*  appeal to him and like from the people I've talked to closest to him again in [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1823.1s)]
*  September, when they started these meetings and they're going through all [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1827.3999999999999s)]
*  these games, I don't think that they were thinking like what, what college [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1829.8s)]
*  program might, you know, come open that would be cool. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1834.5s)]
*  It was really as the season went on and he became more intrigued with the [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1837.4s)]
*  college game that he asked these guys to look into some of these programs [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1841.4s)]
*  a little bit more. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1844.4s)]
*  Well, what would it look like if we took my methodologies and [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1845.3s)]
*  tried to adapt them to this? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1847.8s)]
*  You know, how would that go? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1849.9s)]
*  And you know, is the ability to knowing that I'll be able to win or lose on [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1852.4s)]
*  my own terms worth the risk of not interviewing or, you know, yeah, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1857.5s)]
*  yeah, hoping that before any of those jobs come open and, you know, it was [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1862.3999999999999s)]
*  really kind of a resounding yes. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1868.3s)]
*  There was one thing that I read in some of the stuff that's been written about [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1870.7s)]
*  this already is with the, with this college job, what he wants to do at [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1874.3999999999999s)]
*  North Carolina, I thought was fascinating where he basically wants to [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1880.8999999999999s)]
*  turn it into this football factory that trains people to go to the NFL. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1884.3999999999999s)]
*  So this is something Cal Perry tried to do at Kentucky, right? [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1889.8000000000002s)]
*  This was a big part of their mindset of like college sports is changing. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1894.3000000000002s)]
*  The one and done errors is coming. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1899.4s)]
*  We are going to be this factory that sends people into the lottery, top [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1902.1000000000001s)]
*  five pick, whatever you want to be. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1907.5s)]
*  We're going to train you to do that. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1909.5s)]
*  And if you look at the success of the Kentucky guys that came in the NBA, like [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1910.9s)]
*  there's other reasons for that. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1914.9s)]
*  There are other people that were involved in that, uh, that kind of [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1916.0s)]
*  chain, like people like worldwide West is now one of the people on the dance. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1919.6s)]
*  But a lot of those Kentucky people did come into the league position to [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1923.8s)]
*  succeed and they did, and they've had the most success, I think of any [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1929.6s)]
*  college the last 15 years. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1933.1s)]
*  So when I read that about Belichick, I was like, that's interesting that [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1935.3s)]
*  he's trying to reinvent himself basically as, you know, using North Carolina [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1939.3s)]
*  awesome, awesome school, like one of the top 25 colleges, probably, um, ACC. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1944.0s)]
*  You have a natural arrival in Duke. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1949.7s)]
*  You get to play big games. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1951.7s)]
*  You have a chance to make the playoffs, but big picture. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1952.7s)]
*  Hey, if you want to play in the NFL, you're going to learn stuff here [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1956.0s)]
*  that may be other places. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1959.7s)]
*  It won't be the same. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1962.3000000000002s)]
*  That makes sense to me. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1964.0s)]
*  Now, whether he can sell that to some 17 year old kid and some, you know, and [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1965.6000000000001s)]
*  their parents in Memphis, Tennessee, or, you know, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1970.0s)]
*  wherever he goes to recruit. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1974.3s)]
*  I don't know if that's going to work, but it makes sense to me. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1975.6s)]
*  I it's a pretty good pitch. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1979.1s)]
*  And I also think that it'll be interesting to see, you know, which NFL [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1980.3s)]
*  teams end up drafting out of that program. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1984.5s)]
*  Most like, you know, when he had the first run with the Patriots, you know, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1986.5s)]
*  when they win three out of four super bowls, and then his system got [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1991.4s)]
*  raided around the NFL, he had some tough drafts there. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1995.8s)]
*  And one of the reasons was because all of a sudden, what felt like half [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=1999.2s)]
*  the league was looking for the type of player that only he was looking for [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2002.9s)]
*  before. And so all of a sudden there was a premium on those types of players. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2006.1000000000001s)]
*  Now, who knows exactly? [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2010.2s)]
*  I mean, it would be interesting to see, like, if. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2013.0s)]
*  The Chargers, if the Ravens, if. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2016.9s)]
*  Oh, teams that he has connections with. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2022.7s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2024.5s)]
*  That he would have connections with, you know, the Giants, Denver, you know, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2025.3s)]
*  with like those types of players, those types of teams end up really looking [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2028.6s)]
*  hard at North Carolina players and wanting them because they'll have a better [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2032.1s)]
*  sense that they're mentally equipped to handle the rigors of the NFL. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2036.6s)]
*  Name another coach who can get you ready for it. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2043.0s)]
*  I think that Jim Harbrook, Michigan could probably do it pretty well, but [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2045.4s)]
*  name another coach who you can say, I will prepare you for what it's for. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2048.6s)]
*  What life is like in this league. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2053.4s)]
*  And it's, you know, as we all know, that goes way beyond schematics in doing [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2054.9s)]
*  your job. It is a complete lifestyle change. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2059.8s)]
*  Everyone talks about it. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2062.8s)]
*  How different it is when football ceases to be, you know, your quote unquote [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2063.8s)]
*  job and becomes your real job. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2068.0s)]
*  And. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2070.3s)]
*  I think that he'll enjoy doing that like years ago. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2072.1s)]
*  Years ago. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2075.8s)]
*  It was in 2006. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2076.6s)]
*  It was around the time the Halberstam book came out. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2077.7000000000003s)]
*  Bill wouldn't promote it during the year, but in the off season, he did a [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2080.3s)]
*  couple of events and he did one at Southern Connecticut. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2083.3s)]
*  And I, he received like a distinguished speaker award and I went to it. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2086.7000000000003s)]
*  And I was really curious on how it was going to go. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2091.3s)]
*  And he was so at ease in that audience in front of those young minds. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2094.4s)]
*  And you know, he wasn't talking about football. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2099.2000000000003s)]
*  He showed some clips. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2101.9s)]
*  He kind of went to the film in kind of a funny way, but he wasn't like [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2103.5s)]
*  talking about football and using these kind of flat metaphors for how it [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2107.7000000000003s)]
*  prepares you for life and this type of thing. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2110.7000000000003s)]
*  He was actually addressing these kids in terms of their passion and what [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2112.2s)]
*  they want to do and how best to do it. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2115.7999999999997s)]
*  And he was just on fire and he was inspiring. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2118.0s)]
*  And I do think that like, that's probably a muscle that he hasn't had a [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2120.7s)]
*  chance to flex as much in the NFL. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2124.7s)]
*  And I think that he'll really look forward to doing that because he'll [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2126.8999999999996s)]
*  know that the vast majority of even his players won't play in the pros. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2129.2999999999997s)]
*  But I think that he'll enjoy preparing these people for life beyond football. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2133.6s)]
*  Which to be honest, even though we know that he can do that, it is surprising [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2140.4s)]
*  for Belichick because he's someone who's like self-worth almost seems tied to, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2146.5s)]
*  you know, the results of games. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2152.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2154.8s)]
*  It made sense to me that he went to a school that actually is a strong [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2155.0s)]
*  academic school because the other way this could have gone that wouldn't [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2159.1s)]
*  have shocked me is if he just took over like, I don't know what jobs are open, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2162.9s)]
*  but Amherst, Williams, Harvard, Yale. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2166.4s)]
*  One of those just like he went full div three. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2169.2000000000003s)]
*  Now that would have been tougher for all the people he's bringing with him. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2171.8s)]
*  And I don't, I don't know if there's same amount of money, but, um, but [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2174.6000000000004s)]
*  the North Carolina Duke, that kind of level of really good schools that also [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2178.9s)]
*  um, have football at a pretty competitive level, it makes sense to me. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2184.4s)]
*  Now the thing he has to deal with here is if he's grumpy, curmudgeon Belichick, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2188.5s)]
*  every single person he's coaching is on a one year deal with this new college [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2195.6s)]
*  system and that balance, that's why we've seen a bunch of coaches get out. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2199.5s)]
*  They didn't want to deal with it. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2204.7999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2205.7999999999997s)]
*  He's, he's approaching it fresh, but, um, that that's the biggest X factor to me. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2206.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2212.6s)]
*  He's yelling at whoever and they're just like, okay, cool. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2212.8999999999996s)]
*  I'm going to be at Ohio state next year. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2215.3999999999996s)]
*  So college is kind of a combination and maybe it's unofficially always [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2218.2999999999997s)]
*  been this way of like raw and I, all money and how much am I getting? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2224.2s)]
*  And cult of personality. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2229.7s)]
*  I mean, you see it with the on Sanders. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2231.0s)]
*  It is just such a cult of personality. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2232.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2234.5s)]
*  Even Saban, you know, he had reached that level. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2235.2s)]
*  And I think that like, it's, it's, it's kind of interesting to consider, but [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2239.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's like, you know, Belichick has reached a higher cultural place than [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2243.2999999999997s)]
*  any football coach for the last two decades. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2249.5s)]
*  I would hope so. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2251.3999999999996s)]
*  And, and you know, as a, as a cult of personality type of guy, I mean, you [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2252.1s)]
*  knew when, when craft started marketing the hoodies with the sleeves cut off, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2257.7s)]
*  you know, that something had changed in the atmosphere and you know, a lot of [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2262.0s)]
*  the players that he'll be recruiting don't know, they wouldn't have been [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2265.9s)]
*  born when he was winning super bowls with the Patriots, but I think that like [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2269.7s)]
*  the cult of personality will be strong with him. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2276.4s)]
*  And I think that like, that affords you a lot of the things that if you're a [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2278.7999999999997s)]
*  good coach at a good program, you know, makes this job so difficult because I [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2285.2999999999997s)]
*  don't think that he's going to be married to his phone all day, texting [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2289.8999999999996s)]
*  every single position and making sure that they're not entering the portal [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2293.3999999999996s)]
*  after practice, metaphorically speaking. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2296.3999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2299.6s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you this. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2300.2999999999997s)]
*  He's going to be going against certain coaches that he's going to be so [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2302.5s)]
*  overqualified competitively that it's going to be kind of hilarious. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2306.9s)]
*  And I'm in the camp of, I think he's actually going to do really well [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2311.1000000000004s)]
*  because just like his attention to detail and the game management stuff [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2316.1000000000004s)]
*  he'll be able to do is going to be so far superior to some of these [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2320.9s)]
*  dudes that are in college. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2324.5s)]
*  That's one of my frustrations. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2325.5s)]
*  When I watch colleges, I can't believe how sloppy and dumb and stupid [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2326.9s)]
*  some of the stuff is, especially late. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2330.9s)]
*  But here's what I mean. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2334.7000000000003s)]
*  Just imagine like someone like Davos Sweeney. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2335.4s)]
*  I mean, just like, you know, you've he's clearly an elite college [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2337.2000000000003s)]
*  coach that doesn't run the most sophisticated offense. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2341.7000000000003s)]
*  And, you know, I think that like when Deshaun Watson came into the NFL, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2347.5s)]
*  I think Bill O'Brien did a great job with him and Deshaun for a while [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2351.1s)]
*  there was like on the verge of being one of the top five quarterbacks [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2353.8s)]
*  in the NFL. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2357.0s)]
*  I mean, they had to mesh a lot of what they did in Clemson with like [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2357.9s)]
*  the stuff, you know, pulling from like the Brady rookie playbook, right? [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2361.3s)]
*  Of the Patriots offense. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2365.0s)]
*  And, you know, he will take that stuff is a huge challenge. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2366.6s)]
*  I mean, you know, the fact that you essentially have, you know, great [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2371.6s)]
*  inflation in college with some of these quarterback numbers that are [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2376.2s)]
*  being put up. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2379.2s)]
*  I mean, he will take that stuff personally. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2379.7s)]
*  But there's also that aspect to the, you know, the fact that like [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2382.1s)]
*  he is who he is. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2385.7s)]
*  And I mean, Brady on Fox the other day was asked about Belichick [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2386.6s)]
*  in college and he just like was could not imagine him there. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2390.4s)]
*  And it's a funny clip of him. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2392.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2394.4s)]
*  Doing his impression of Bill giving his pitch, you know, well, we [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2394.9s)]
*  don't really want you, but if you want to come here, we'll see what [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2397.7s)]
*  you can do. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2400.4s)]
*  I mean, that part of it is really kind of interesting because he's [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2401.0s)]
*  going to be the complete opposite of what every other kid hears. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2404.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2410.2s)]
*  It's basically he's Bobby Knight in the modern era. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2410.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2414.5s)]
*  If it's over 302 wins for the NFL third all time. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2416.2999999999997s)]
*  31 and 13 in the playoffs, including not including 13 buys. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2421.4s)]
*  So 31 and 13 plus the bias. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2427.3s)]
*  He's basically 44 and 13. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2429.6s)]
*  333 combined wins. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2432.6s)]
*  Only Don Schula had more than 347. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2434.5s)]
*  Six and three in Superbowl's three more as an assistant. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2437.2s)]
*  So nine total. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2440.1s)]
*  And really the only person with a chance to catch him with any of [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2441.9s)]
*  this stuff seems to be Andy Reed who is 32 wins behind him and five [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2444.8s)]
*  playoff wins behind him and it's probably going to pass him. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2450.1s)]
*  And I'm sure bell chicks probably okay with it. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2452.9s)]
*  And I was wondering, I wondered if that factored into it where he's [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2457.7s)]
*  like, even if I did go to Jacksonville and I coached two years and [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2460.2999999999997s)]
*  get the record, am I going to hold it for remember like when I remember [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2463.7s)]
*  when Drew Brees was breaking all those records and you knew that he [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2467.1s)]
*  was only going to have him until Brady, you know, another half season. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2470.2999999999997s)]
*  I wonder if he did that calculus went into things, you know, is that [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2474.2999999999997s)]
*  worth it for me? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2477.0s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2479.1s)]
*  I mean that if it was Philly, if Sarayani went sideways and he's [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2480.2s)]
*  moving in mid season, but you know, I, I talked to, I talked to his [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2484.7999999999997s)]
*  people about him doing a podcast, like with ringer Spotify, cause he, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2490.2s)]
*  you know, they talked to everybody last year and one of the things they [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2493.4s)]
*  made very clear to everybody who was discussing any sort of media thing [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2497.2999999999997s)]
*  with him is Belchick will be coaching in February, right? [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2501.0s)]
*  It's like, keep it low, but this is a one year thing. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2504.2999999999997s)]
*  This is not a new career. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2507.5s)]
*  He's doing this for one year. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2508.9s)]
*  He will be coaching in February. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2510.9s)]
*  And I always thought that was interesting that they're so honest about it. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2512.8s)]
*  And just like, this is, he clearly wanted to do all the media stuff [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2517.3s)]
*  because he wanted to make money, but he was also trying to shift [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2522.4s)]
*  some sort of perception about him. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2526.7000000000003s)]
*  And I think for the most part it worked because I think if you think about [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2529.7000000000003s)]
*  him in July, people just knew him as the all time coach curmudgeon we've [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2533.6s)]
*  ever had not, not, not the same now. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2538.6s)]
*  I don't think like he's inside the NFL as humor came out a little bit. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2542.6s)]
*  The manning cast, I, you know, there were some pretty dreary moments in the [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2546.2s)]
*  manning cast, but there were some muscles, some fun clips too. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2550.2s)]
*  And some edgy moments. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2553.6s)]
*  So you get to see that edginess with him sometimes. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2554.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2557.4s)]
*  He would, he would do that Jim gray podcast sometimes and he'd, he'd start [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2557.5s)]
*  throwing darts at coaches and stuff occasionally. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2560.9s)]
*  So there was a little more, I think that most people thought, but for people [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2563.5s)]
*  like you and me who had been watching him forever, like none of it was [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2566.4s)]
*  surprising it backed up everything we had, we'd already heard, but I always [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2569.6s)]
*  felt like his, his sense of what his place was in football history and how [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2573.8s)]
*  he could shape that a little bit. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2580.3s)]
*  I always thought he was way more aware of that. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2581.7000000000003s)]
*  You don't let Halberstam do a biography of you. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2584.0s)]
*  You don't let the NFL film crew follow you around for a year. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2586.1s)]
*  Like he did care about that stuff. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2589.8s)]
*  I think a little more than people realize, right? [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2591.4s)]
*  That was always my take. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2594.9s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2596.9s)]
*  I mean, legacy has always been important to him and not just his legacy, but [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2597.6s)]
*  the legacy of, of the things that he built. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2603.3s)]
*  I mean, I always was told that like, you know, back when he thought he would [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2606.1s)]
*  always leave the Patriots on his terms, he would never leave it if they were down. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2610.8s)]
*  Like he always wanted to hand over the team, a good team to his successor. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2615.4s)]
*  So that like, no matter what you said about him, you could always say that [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2620.6s)]
*  he made decisions that he thought were best in the best interest of the team, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2624.6000000000004s)]
*  not himself, but the team and the franchise. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2628.1000000000004s)]
*  And that was a lasting legacy beyond him, you know, on the sidelines and [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2630.7000000000003s)]
*  watching him this year and even he was throttled, you know, you could tell [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2636.3s)]
*  there was moments where maybe he would have gone there a little bit more, but [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2641.7000000000003s)]
*  he had to restrain himself a little bit because he knows that he still wants [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2644.3s)]
*  to get back in and he's not quite done with this and it's not quite his [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2647.7000000000003s)]
*  personality, just to rip guys. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2650.6000000000004s)]
*  That was my fear with him doing a podcast with us. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2652.3999999999996s)]
*  How far is he going to go? [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2655.5s)]
*  Is he going to hold back? [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2656.7s)]
*  But the gap between him and most of the league was just painfully obvious. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2658.5s)]
*  And I get all the reasons that I think there's a lot of people who thought that [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2664.2s)]
*  like, remember when Mike Shanahan sat out a year and teams started to fire [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2668.6s)]
*  their coaches early so they could get the inside track on him? [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2673.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2676.8999999999996s)]
*  There was a sense that might happen with Belichick, but because of the rules [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2677.3999999999996s)]
*  that are in place, you know, that never really happened. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2681.1s)]
*  And plus I just don't think, I think owners just had, you know, like we've [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2683.7999999999997s)]
*  talked about all their reasons as valid or not as they may be of why they [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2689.6s)]
*  would rather bring in someone else. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2695.6s)]
*  And it's like, it's kind of hard not to be happy for Belichick and you know, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2697.2s)]
*  that he's landed in a place that he seems legitimately stoked about. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2703.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2707.2000000000003s)]
*  And even the crafts, they did end up with Drake may somehow, right? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2707.5s)]
*  They probably have one of the four worst coaches in the league. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2713.4s)]
*  They have one of the, I think one of the worst front offices in the [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2716.2000000000003s)]
*  league that just had a horrible draft and a horrible free agency. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2719.3s)]
*  But they do have this, this guy now who has a chance to be one of the five or [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2723.4s)]
*  six best QBs in the league and the whole fan base is completely in on him. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2727.2000000000003s)]
*  And now it's become, I look at it and I'm just like variable sitting there. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2732.3s)]
*  Like, I don't understand. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2737.0s)]
*  They, if you go back and you look at variables, Tennessee career in 2021, he [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2739.2000000000003s)]
*  was 12 and five and go look at that team. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2744.4s)]
*  Like it's kind of like about to be washed up. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2748.5s)]
*  Maybe already was tan hill there can replace half the season. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2750.9s)]
*  AJ Brown is about to get traded for Traylon Burke straight up. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2754.8s)]
*  Trayvon Burke's whatever his name is. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2758.9s)]
*  Um, and they overachieve with that team and then they trade, they trade brown. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2760.9s)]
*  QB situation goes sideways. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2766.7000000000003s)]
*  Vrabel starts, you know, battling the front office and he's gone and [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2769.7000000000003s)]
*  now he's just sitting there. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2773.8s)]
*  And to me, like what we're talking about earlier about Harbaugh, Peyton, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2775.5s)]
*  there's just like seven, eight coaches, Tomlin, seven, eight coaches that really [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2779.1000000000004s)]
*  matter. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2783.3s)]
*  I think variable is one of the seven or eight you have Drake may, I don't [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2784.1000000000004s)]
*  understand if these last four games for the Pats don't go bad, if they go badly. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2788.5s)]
*  Just admit the mistake and hire variable. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2793.5s)]
*  He's a Patriot Hall of Famer. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2795.6s)]
*  I think he come. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2797.0s)]
*  Why wouldn't they do it? [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2798.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, couple things. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2800.6s)]
*  I think that like, first of all variable is suffering from a little bit of the [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2802.0s)]
*  same thing that Belichick has, like, you know, this perception that you got to [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2805.3s)]
*  give him the keys and let him do it his way. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2808.4s)]
*  That guy's an excellent, excellent coach. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2810.8s)]
*  I actually think that, I mean, it's obvious that Tennessee was better under [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2813.6s)]
*  him and they were tougher under him. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2817.4s)]
*  I actually think that if you are trying to develop Will Levis, he was better for [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2819.0s)]
*  that because he knew how to protect quarterbacks. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2823.2000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2825.4s)]
*  Like he knew how to run an offense that didn't put everything on them and took [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2825.6s)]
*  some of the pressure off. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2829.8s)]
*  And, you know, I think he's suffering from a little bit of the stuff you see [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2831.4s)]
*  from Belichick. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2835.2000000000003s)]
*  Would the crafts move on from Gerard Mayo? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2837.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2838.9s)]
*  I mean, I think so either. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2839.8s)]
*  I think craft has said publicly that he decided in 18 or six. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2842.1s)]
*  Five years ago. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2847.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2848.5s)]
*  Somewhere around that time that that he was going to succeed Belichick and it's [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2848.7000000000003s)]
*  unless there's something that's going on in the building that's so dysfunctional [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2854.4s)]
*  that hasn't come out yet. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2858.9s)]
*  That is just beyond intolerable. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2860.1s)]
*  I would really have a hard time seeing Robert Kraft, you know, move on from [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2862.4s)]
*  from a coach like that after one year. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2866.8s)]
*  I agree. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2869.3s)]
*  And yet I do feel like this is one of those situations where it from everything [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2870.5s)]
*  we've seen this first year, there's really no glimmer of hope so far with the [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2876.4s)]
*  coach and the coaching staff and really any piece of this. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2880.5s)]
*  And now it's like, well, so now we're going to run and then a year from [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2884.3s)]
*  now, we'll change everything. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2888.2000000000003s)]
*  Um, that's why these. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2890.1000000000004s)]
*  Well, these next four games are going to be so important because like Arizona [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2892.5s)]
*  this weekend is a winnable game for them. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2899.2000000000003s)]
*  Arizona, I think has overachieved a little. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2901.3s)]
*  They're not that time. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2903.3s)]
*  They're from a talent standpoint, not like crazy different than the Pats and may [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2904.0s)]
*  might be able to just beat them by himself. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2907.7000000000003s)]
*  Um, but if they, they play Buffalo twice, I forget who the last game is, but I [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2910.2s)]
*  feel like if they go on four and it's like a bad on four, I'm prepared for [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2914.2999999999997s)]
*  anything because crafts old these, these owners get old and they're like, fuck [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2918.7s)]
*  it. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2922.2s)]
*  I'm that's I'm in my eighties. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2922.2999999999997s)]
*  Like I don't want to go down this way. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2924.6s)]
*  And press them plus with a variable as prickly as he can be, they're used to [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2927.5s)]
*  that, like they're like, whatever, like, you know, whatever, you know, Tennessee [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2931.1s)]
*  can't handle, they're like, it's fine with us. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2935.5s)]
*  This is a beach. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2938.2999999999997s)]
*  Like we've been through worse and, and he's, you know, and he's a good coach. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2939.1s)]
*  He's a really good coach. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2944.2999999999997s)]
*  It's a real. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2945.5s)]
*  Well, the funniest thing to me is why Chicago wouldn't hire him and shit. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2947.2999999999997s)]
*  And it's like, they're enamored with Ben Johnson. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2950.7999999999997s)]
*  He calls great plays. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2952.7s)]
*  It's like, how much evidence do we need that that might not be the deciding [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2953.7999999999997s)]
*  reason to hire a coach? [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2957.1s)]
*  Like in the last like 15 years, Kyle Shanahan is the only real whiz kid new [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2958.5s)]
*  coach, even somebody like McVeigh who I think gets credit for that. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2964.2s)]
*  McVeigh is a football coach. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2967.0s)]
*  He's he's doing everything on all sides. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2968.8999999999996s)]
*  He's a, he's a people manager. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2971.7999999999997s)]
*  He's a strategy, you know, he's not just like, here are my, here's, here are my [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2973.3999999999996s)]
*  50 plays I'm bringing in the game for Abel is like a culture changer. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2977.7s)]
*  Chicago needs to, you know, they, they, they play in the worst weather, probably [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2981.7s)]
*  in the league other than maybe two other cities, like they need to be like [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2987.1s)]
*  tougher on the lines. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2990.3999999999996s)]
*  They need to be able to protect Caleb. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2991.5s)]
*  I don't understand how just hiring a play car is going to be the answer for them. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2993.7s)]
*  But what do I know? [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2997.1s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2998.5s)]
*  It's Bella. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2999.0s)]
*  It's a little bit like Belichick. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=2999.3999999999996s)]
*  I mean, you know, he's a total head coach. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3000.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3003.1s)]
*  You can go cut some coach running backs if he needs to. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3003.2999999999997s)]
*  And variable is a very similar. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3006.0s)]
*  He learned, you know, from him and others, but like variable is a total head coach. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3007.7s)]
*  I'll never forget. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3012.1s)]
*  Um, Belichick's last playoff game. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3013.5s)]
*  I guess we were saying that's the last playoff game with Brady. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3016.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3019.7999999999997s)]
*  Um, when they lost to the Titans at home on that, on that rainy night. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3020.0s)]
*  And you know, the Patriots need the ball back. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3023.7999999999997s)]
*  They get a stop and you keep thinking, you're thinking this is when, you [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3028.2999999999997s)]
*  know, we've seen this, you know, all of a sudden they're going to turn it on. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3031.1s)]
*  And variable deploys that clock management trick that Belichick had used [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3034.7s)]
*  against the jets earlier that year. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3038.8999999999996s)]
*  And Belichick's just going nuts on the sideline and melting down. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3040.8999999999996s)]
*  And you can tell he is hot because, but, but variable had learned, like [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3043.7999999999997s)]
*  he had studied the guy and he knew in the exact situation when to use [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3048.7s)]
*  that that is next level coaching. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3053.0s)]
*  And when you watch like, again, the end of like the bears, um, lions game, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3055.1s)]
*  which is just like a debacle on every front, it's just obvious that there are [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3060.5s)]
*  some of these guys out there that are fundamentally coaching and teaching a [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3064.2s)]
*  different sport and others are just kind of glorified play callers. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3068.0s)]
*  And that would be my concern with Ben Johnson, even though [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3071.7s)]
*  he's an imaginative play caller. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3074.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3076.4s)]
*  Sal and I talked about a little on Sunday. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3076.6s)]
*  I just think being a head football coach and being somebody who specializes [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3079.4s)]
*  on one side of the ball, the other over and over again, I would just [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3083.9s)]
*  rather have the overall head coach. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3086.7s)]
*  Who's he rate? [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3088.2s)]
*  Like Kevin Clark wrote a really good piece for us on the ringer. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3089.4s)]
*  I think it was for the 23 season about variable and all the stuff that he did [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3093.2999999999997s)]
*  for the Titans and people can go back and read it, but just about how he [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3097.2s)]
*  would grab different time with different, you know, he'd just be like, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3100.5s)]
*  I'm going to spend a half hour with the left guard because I don't like the way [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3103.6s)]
*  that he's stepping back on just every aspect of the team. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3106.6s)]
*  And I think for the Patriots fans, like the stuff we read and hear about mail, [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3110.6s)]
*  like we're just, it just doesn't seem like that's happening. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3114.4s)]
*  Not to mention the media stuff's been bad. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3117.6s)]
*  The game management stuff's been bad. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3119.5s)]
*  The team is exceptionally sloppy and I it's, I'm waiting for a light at [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3121.1s)]
*  the end of the tunnel with him because it would be a hell of a lot easier [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3126.9s)]
*  for all of us if he was a good coach or had a chance to make a coach. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3129.7s)]
*  But these next four, uh, these next four games are going to determine it. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3132.6s)]
*  All right. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3136.2s)]
*  So you announced you have a new book coming in September. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3136.5s)]
*  It's called American Kings biography of the quarterback available for preorder [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3139.3999999999996s)]
*  now, and you just used your massive media clout to just go get time with a [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3144.2s)]
*  bunch of famous quarterbacks and find out what's going on with that position. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3150.0s)]
*  Including Drake may, but yeah, you know, I, I, I want to write a book that, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3153.8999999999996s)]
*  you know, takes the most encompassing look at this position. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3158.0s)]
*  I possibly could, you know, what's it like to do with every one of these levels? [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3160.8999999999996s)]
*  What does it build in you? [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3164.5s)]
*  What does it strip away? [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3165.4s)]
*  What is it like doing in high school college as a rookie? [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3166.3s)]
*  Um, how did this thing become cool? [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3169.6s)]
*  You know, the answer, as it turns out, goes back to 1885 and runs right [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3171.8s)]
*  through LA in the coming decades. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3176.6s)]
*  And, um, you know, then what is it like to live with this the rest of your [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3178.8s)]
*  life and what ways is it, is it incompatible with kind of future happiness? [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3183.1s)]
*  I, you know, that's, that's what I wanted to do. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3187.1s)]
*  And yeah, I spent some time with your boy, Drake may, um, when he was at [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3189.2000000000003s)]
*  Carolina and his family and the coaching staff there at the time. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3192.5s)]
*  And, um, I really enjoyed, you know, spending time with him. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3195.5s)]
*  And I do think that like part of the reason he was appealing to the [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3199.3s)]
*  Patriots, there's a Brady factor there. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3202.6s)]
*  Where it's like, you had the youngest kid in a family of achievers who [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3204.9s)]
*  had to fight for attention. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3207.8s)]
*  And, you know, when he decided to go to North Carolina, he knew, you [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3209.6s)]
*  know, right then that like, it's not about whether you make it in the NFL or not. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3216.0s)]
*  It's actually just whether you have something to say at Thanksgiving [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3220.2s)]
*  with your family around, you know, did you, did you do something that year [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3224.2999999999997s)]
*  that, that lets you have, be part of that conversation? [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3229.0s)]
*  And, um, anyway, I had a great time reporting it and working on it [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3231.7s)]
*  and, um, looking forward to September. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3235.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3238.5s)]
*  I obviously was obsessed with that draft in April and reading everything, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3238.7s)]
*  talking to as many people as I could talk to. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3242.4s)]
*  And, um, and I was so all in on, on May, but Manning, [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3244.2999999999997s)]
*  ironically, I was at a thing with him and I was just picking his [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3249.9s)]
*  brain cause he knew May a little bit. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3253.5s)]
*  And I was like, I really feel like May's the guy. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3255.3s)]
*  And, and Manning was like, oh yeah, that guy's the man. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3257.4s)]
*  Like that guy's going to be really good. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3262.0s)]
*  I was like, really? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3263.4s)]
*  Like, I was like, really? [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3264.2000000000003s)]
*  You think he's going to be good? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3266.0s)]
*  But I do think part of, and I'm sure your book taps into that is how the [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3267.5s)]
*  guys who have done it can spot things with the next guys. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3271.0s)]
*  Like, oh, like they just kind of know who has and who doesn't. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3275.5s)]
*  And May's been, it's been the opposite of, uh, you know, some of the other [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3279.0s)]
*  people we've had in different sports over the years, May's just been, [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3284.1s)]
*  he's checked every box. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3287.2000000000003s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3288.5s)]
*  Like he knows what to say in the press conferences already. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3289.1s)]
*  It's nuts. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3291.5s)]
*  He has. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3292.9s)]
*  And I mean, I think that like to take back what you said, I mean, I [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3293.3s)]
*  think there's an element of it where, you know, they think they can. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3295.6s)]
*  And then sometimes they can't too. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3298.6s)]
*  So like, you know, what makes this job in these weird responsibilities? [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3300.1s)]
*  It has so unique and so hard, you know, so mythologized and so hard to [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3304.9s)]
*  predict baffles these guys. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3311.6s)]
*  I mean, Steve Young loved Zach Wilson, mentored him. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3313.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3317.8s)]
*  And you know, what happened, what happened, what happened is Sam [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3318.0s)]
*  Darnold, how does he go from it? [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3321.44s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3324.1s)]
*  I think situation so much of it, which is why the Drake May thing has been [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3324.6s)]
*  amazing because he's in a bad situation. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3328.4s)]
*  He's got bad receivers and a bad offensive line. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3330.9s)]
*  And it does seem like his coaching staff's that great. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3333.0s)]
*  Van Pelt might be all right, but, um, but Darnold, holy shit. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3334.7s)]
*  You look back at the situation he was in and it was like, of course [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3339.2999999999997s)]
*  he wasn't going to succeed, especially at the age he was at. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3341.7s)]
*  Um, and to tie it all back, Belichick used Darnold to take another crack at the Jets. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3345.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3351.0s)]
*  He loved that. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3351.6s)]
*  He sent that a few times. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3352.1s)]
*  He loved mentioning that every team wanted, wanted to keep Darnold and [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3353.7999999999997s)]
*  liked him except for the Jets. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3357.2s)]
*  So, right. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3358.2999999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3359.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, I look forward to reading that book. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3360.0s)]
*  It's a great idea. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0gCV1PX3o&t=3361.2s)]
