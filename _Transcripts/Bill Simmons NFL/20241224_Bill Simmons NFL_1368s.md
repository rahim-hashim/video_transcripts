# A Holiday Present! Bill Simmons’ Christmas Day Million-Dollar Picks With Joe House
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [December 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ)
*  YouTube only Christmas Eve Joe house is here. We're going to do a little bit of the million dollar picks [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Because we love all the Christmas games. This is an unusual situation house two NFL games on Wednesday five NBA games [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=6.72s)]
*  Another Thursday night NFL game. We're gonna do a million dollar picks on my podcast on Thursday [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=13.9s)]
*  But why would we not jump in on some of these beautiful bets? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=18.56s)]
*  They're magnificent games on Christmas. What a gift we've been given [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  We've complained over the course of the year about these great teams having to play on short rest and all that stuff [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=27.52s)]
*  Put that in the rearview mirror. We've got majestic football on Christmas BS. All right chiefs [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=33.3s)]
*  Steelers in Ravens Texans and I want to bring in Seahawks Bears too because it's Thursday night [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=39.239999999999995s)]
*  But we're putting million dollar picks up as part of the podcast on Thursday night [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=44.84s)]
*  but we also have five basketball games and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=48.8s)]
*  I think there's a way to do some some small NFL bets [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=51.76s)]
*  But then maybe a little master [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=55.32s)]
*  Christmas buffet parlay with some NBA and some NFL, you know, it's like a taster like [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=58.56s)]
*  Christmas casserole the Christmas buffet it really is [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=64.48s)]
*  That time of year and it speaks to you and I and to all of our our great listeners [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=68.6s)]
*  Yeah, chiefs dealers chiefs minus two and a half [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=73.22s)]
*  Casey clenches the one seed with a win [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=76.68s)]
*  Steelers have not looked like the same team for about a month. Their o-line is basically destroyed [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=79.08s)]
*  Pickens is hurt might play might not play [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=84.48s)]
*  Joey Porter hurt probably playing [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=87.48s)]
*  Their secondary is banged up [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=90.12s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=92.4s)]
*  The only case for them is can they just try to run the ball on the on the Chiefs and and maybe their pass rush can [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=92.92s)]
*  Bother the Chiefs the Chiefs are on their fourth left tackle. I don't see really any case at all [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=99.0s)]
*  The Chiefs win this game. They locked down the one seed. They're done [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=103.72s)]
*  They basically from Wednesday on get to rest all the way until round two of the playoffs which will be like January 20th [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  So they all if there's win tomorrow, they won't play another meaningful game for four weeks [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  everybody rest get the offensive line and the steward's need the game, but they don't really need it because [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=118.76s)]
*  They're kind of locked into the five seed or the succeed whatever it's it's slim slim chance Baltimore is gonna be Houston [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=125.56s)]
*  We'll talk about that in a second [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=132.52s)]
*  Slim chance they're gonna get the AFC North. I think at this point the odds reflect it [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=134.56s)]
*  So chiefs minus two and a half or do you want to go out line? What are you thinking? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=139.32s)]
*  Who well definitely the the two and a half? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=143.28s)]
*  My homes is undefeated against the Pittsburgh Steelers in his career three and oh against the spread and straight-up 14 touchdowns one [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=147.11999999999998s)]
*  Interception and we do have some some rivaling competing [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=155.04s)]
*  Trends here my homes as an underdog or favorite of three or less [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=159.64s)]
*  We love that one 26 nine and one against the spread [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=165.32s)]
*  But what you're going up against is Tomlin coming off of losses Tomlin as a home dog [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=169.3s)]
*  21 6 and 3 against yeah, I know I don't like it. It's amazing [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=175.14000000000001s)]
*  But here's the thing at the end of the day two things first of all [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=178.46s)]
*  We've been putting a lot of eggs and in in George Pickens these nuts [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=182.66000000000003s)]
*  Basket haven't we yeah Pickens these nuts has been like will he be back? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=187.5s)]
*  That's the key to this Pittsburgh offense even if he is back. I'm not sure that I'm ready to [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=191.9s)]
*  Invest in Pittsburgh what at the end of the game when when these two offenses have the ball which one do you trust more? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=198.76s)]
*  And it's this kind of an easy one to me and you laid out the case [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=205.56s)]
*  Kansas City with Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid does not fuck around under these circumstances. They go out [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=209.04s)]
*  They put the hammer down they get what they need so they're ready for the playoff run. This is [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=214.5s)]
*  Exactly a nice spot for the chief love them on the money line love them in money line parlays our anchor parlay strategy was was [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  Successful last weekend four and two we went well [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=226.84s)]
*  We would have met one more of Jalen Hurts doesn't get hurt. That's right great point. Yes, and and if [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=230.48s)]
*  The the wiz what we don't have a nickname for Shanahan. Do you guys have a nickname for Shanahan? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=237.64s)]
*  He's gonna get fired about that. Yeah last week we won a [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=242.56s)]
*  $210,000 we're up [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  1.464 million for the year, but that Niners loss really hurt. They're up. I mean not the Niners the Eagles [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=250.32s)]
*  14th a great for you as a Washington fan magnificent [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=256.72s)]
*  They were the guy over my shoulder there is right there so Casey Steelers one other stat. I noticed yeah [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=259.96000000000004s)]
*  Casey's played 15 games, and they've won 14 [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=267.04s)]
*  I just looked that up on a fancy fancy NFL stats website [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=271.08000000000004s)]
*  15 games they've won 14 in them yeah, I this to me seems like a classic [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=275.72s)]
*  They have a knack for winning these and you know what's interesting [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=280.48s)]
*  It feels like their offense is getting a little bit better as the year goes along little more explosive Hollywood Brown came back [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=283.48s)]
*  Worthy starting to get more involved [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=289.28s)]
*  Yeah, I'm looking at worthy props is a nice way to look at some of this to over on if you can get a four and [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=291.28s)]
*  A half receptions [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=297.08s)]
*  He's really they're building him into the offense over these last few weeks and even with Hollywood Brown's return [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=297.8s)]
*  They have him in screen positions or they're gonna get his touches, so I like this [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  So my homes on Christmas Day on Netflix is another factor [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=307.32s)]
*  All stats all [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=313.44s)]
*  It's just like it's the first first Netflix Christmas Day ever my homes is really gonna lose in Pittsburgh I [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=316.56s)]
*  we've written we we talked we lost on Pittsburgh two weeks ago and [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=323.76s)]
*  We talked about how we stayed at the craps table [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=328.12s)]
*  For one too many shooters they were they treated us great. We hit our future overs before the season not the first [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=331.15999999999997s)]
*  Pittsburgh Pittsburgh to make the playoff bet all that stuff and during the season over and over again [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=338.32s)]
*  They came through and then two weeks ago was one too many against Baltimore [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=344.23999999999995s)]
*  I just don't feel like this is the same Pittsburgh team right now when we get to the playoffs [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=347.88s)]
*  I'm gonna be excited to take them, but I think they're banged up [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=352.64s)]
*  I think their offensive line is banged up and without Pickens [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=356.23999999999995s)]
*  It's just a lot of pressure on Russ. You saw it last week [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=360.0s)]
*  You know he's he made two terrible plays last week, and it was the reason they lost [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=363.32s)]
*  Even if he's back even if we get Pickens these nuts, and he's on the field what kind of capacity [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=368.04s)]
*  He's not gonna be in full roar full tear and to Pittsburgh's credit like you know they've been resourceful [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  They got the deep balls that they needed that game was a 50-50 game on on Saturday [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=379.6s)]
*  And and you know just putting a lot of pressure on Russell Wilson [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=385.88s)]
*  I like the idea of that pressure with my homes on the other side so Casey is third against the run [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=389.70000000000005s)]
*  The case for Pittsburgh in this game would be they run the ball down Casey's throat [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=397.6s)]
*  Russ makes a couple plays one long Pickens play yeah, and then the Chiefs can't get any anything going on offense [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=402.12s)]
*  I just think the Chiefs are better. It's in Pittsburgh. Which is the only reason this line is under three [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=408.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't think the Chiefs care where they play I [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=413.20000000000005s)]
*  So we'll mark down Casey minus two and a half because the other thing I had for you [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=416.04s)]
*  I think we're both gonna like Baltimore in this Houston game [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=420.0s)]
*  And the other thing I had for you is Casey plus three and a half adjusted [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=423.26000000000005s)]
*  So we're just saying it's a three-point game or Casey wins however it turns out [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=427.94000000000005s)]
*  They just don't lose by more than three with the Baltimore money line [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=432.46000000000004s)]
*  Is minus 108 oh near even money? Yeah, I wouldn't we would we're gonna do that [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=436.66s)]
*  So we can just do that and not even mess around with the Casey minus two and a half [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=442.58000000000004s)]
*  And let's look around with it. Yeah, let's do both [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=446.42s)]
*  Okay, the city money's two and a half. I'm just saying we can put a track record there [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=449.90000000000003s)]
*  We could just put a giant Christmas bet that could be the par like Casey plus three and a half Baltimore money line and we [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=453.8s)]
*  We're actually a big number a big trap it up [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=459.90000000000003s)]
*  We're gonna be big fat we have some million dollar money to play with nice big fat one so the Ravens game [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=463.18s)]
*  The Ravens are first at DVO a first offense 10th defense [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=469.74s)]
*  Houston dropped to 13th Houston's offenses 24th DVO a and that was with tanked out who's now gone [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=474.42s)]
*  They just signed the ante Johnson. He was like the Yankee swap [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=480.26s)]
*  Yankee Christmas gift swap guy oh [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=483.9s)]
*  I got the ante Johnson. I gotta give them the rich house [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=486.94s)]
*  And try and stick them with it so you have to keep it [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=491.58s)]
*  Offensive line is bad. There's been a lot of stuff written the last two days about Baltimore's defense [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=494.54s)]
*  How it's it's kind of getting a little bit better they move Kyle Hamilton to safety it's not awesome [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=499.3s)]
*  Yeah, a little better. I like the way they're looking. This is another one like Lamar on Christmas [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=504.53999999999996s)]
*  Houston's locked into their AFC South title already the Baltimore money line seems fantastic the games in Houston [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=510.42s)]
*  Which is why the line is five and a half [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=516.74s)]
*  Oh, it's all up to five and a half. I thought it was it's up to five and a half, right? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=519.78s)]
*  It was in the four and a half [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=523.78s)]
*  Five and a half right it was in the four and a half right now Tuesday [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=525.78s)]
*  Nobody's nobody's waiting everybody grabbed the fours the four and a half the fives [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=530.8199999999999s)]
*  I'm fine with laying it. I'm fine with however you want to play Baltimore. I'm here for it [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=535.06s)]
*  Yeah, I can't see the case for Houston, and I don't think Houston's that good to begin with and especially as they [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=540.06s)]
*  swim into the bigger contender pool so [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=547.02s)]
*  So we have the Baltimore in line bet money line bet I can also offer you Baltimore minus nine and a half [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=550.02s)]
*  adjusted [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=555.9399999999999s)]
*  Oh, they win by ten or more. That's plus 172 [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=556.98s)]
*  I mean reminder [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=561.38s)]
*  Lamar Jackson also [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=563.42s)]
*  Undefeated against the Texans we have two quarterbacks that are undefeated against their opponents on on Christmas Lamar Jackson [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=565.4599999999999s)]
*  Forno straight up and for no against the spread when Baltimore with Lamar Jackson plays [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=570.9399999999999s)]
*  Houston and beats their ass they beat them by margin like what we watched in the playoffs at the beginning of this year this calendar year [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=576.5s)]
*  They cover by average of 15 points per game [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=584.1800000000001s)]
*  So if you want to all spread this one up put a little taster on it [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=587.1400000000001s)]
*  I'm here for it Baltimore has every [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=590.3000000000001s)]
*  Incentive to try and win the AFC North and I think that they're going to do that and I just don't see [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=593.4200000000001s)]
*  A case for Houston's defense, which what about Houston's offense? Yeah [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=600.5s)]
*  I'm like what is that the Stroud numbers are pretty alarming for this year [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=605.36s)]
*  And he's had weapons going in and out but I just I have to do is cover Nico Collins and what how are they gonna score? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=609.98s)]
*  Mix them would have to have this crazy game. Well, they don't more in the second half Baltimore wins the division if Pittsburgh loses once [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=615.98s)]
*  They beat Houston and then they beat Cleveland week 18. I [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=624.22s)]
*  Like their odds they'll know heading into this game because they're the second Christmas game Joe house [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=629.1800000000001s)]
*  Yes, they'll know heading into this game if Casey is beaten Pittsburgh great point great [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=635.46s)]
*  Yes, awesome reason to put those two together as a little parlay action because I have Casey if Casey beats Pittsburgh [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=641.62s)]
*  I think this Baltimore line goes to like seven and I think the money line goes to like minus [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=649.98s)]
*  320 something like that. Let's get it down now [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=656.1800000000001s)]
*  I have one more wrinkle for you that you're not gonna like you're gonna tell me to stop messing around [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=658.6600000000001s)]
*  Okay, the other wrinkle to this the way that we're lining up the [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=663.92s)]
*  divisional outcomes is [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=668.68s)]
*  if the Chiefs win and we get them to win then it takes the pressure off of Buffalo and [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=670.52s)]
*  Buffalo against the Jets, it's a double-digit number right now and [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=676.4s)]
*  There's absolutely no that you know that I would want I layer that into it [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=680.3199999999999s)]
*  I calculated it and and here's where I landed. I don't want to bet on the Jets. I know I understand [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=685.2399999999999s)]
*  I just felt obliged to make that observation that coach might be the stupidest of all the coaches now [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=691.24s)]
*  That's really saying something to you. He might be the number one stupid coach [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=697.04s)]
*  Rogers Rogers looks like it is want to be there anymore Garrett Wilson's already like basically putting himself on eBay. Hey Garrett, Washington [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=702.16s)]
*  We have a great quarterback down here. He'd love to throw you the football. So you're saying [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=709.64s)]
*  you're saying [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=714.84s)]
*  Throw in what it you're saying throw in the Jets money line or just the Jets post [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=716.4s)]
*  No, no, just just grab the points like, you know, the Jets are gonna lose. They'll figure out a way to lose [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=720.4599999999999s)]
*  They'll invent a way to lose but double digit spread. That's all and I'm not saying that we make a big commitment to it under no [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=725.5s)]
*  Circumstances would we ever come on this program and tell people to bet their hard-earned money on the god? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=732.18s)]
*  Tiny partly tiny tastes because like that that that puts the odds up into a territory that feels like Christmas [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=738.06s)]
*  I'll write that one down. So we're gonna put some stuff with Seahawks Bears on Thursday night, too. Yeah because [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=744.9399999999999s)]
*  Seattle needs a win. Yeah, then they need the Rams to lose to Arizona [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=752.98s)]
*  And if those two things happen Seattle can win the division next week [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=756.8199999999999s)]
*  So this is an all-time must-win game for Seattle or the seasons over [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=759.8399999999999s)]
*  On top of that Chicago's lost their last nine [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=763.74s)]
*  Chicago's 42 and 102 in their last three games [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=766.9399999999999s)]
*  Caleb's two more losses away from trying trying Troy Aikman's [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=770.38s)]
*  Rookie QB losing streak record of 11. So congrats to him [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=774.3s)]
*  Just every way you look at this it feels like Seattle Moneyline is the play. Yeah [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=780.5s)]
*  What if I offered you Baltimore minus nine and a half adjusted with the Seattle Moneyline plus 312? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=786.3399999999999s)]
*  Little get some something down on that appetizer on that something down on that. That's a shrimp cocktail [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=794.02s)]
*  Anyone yeah [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=800.54s)]
*  And then the other way the other one that's fun, which I don't want to do [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=803.02s)]
*  I wanted to mention it Seattle Moneyline with the Arizona Moneyline. So you basically here's the here's the case for this house [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=806.42s)]
*  The NFL needs a Sunday night game. Oh [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=813.54s)]
*  For week 18 they need a Sunday night game with stakes for week 18 two options are [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=816.26s)]
*  Minnesota versus Detroit [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=822.9399999999999s)]
*  Or [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=825.74s)]
*  Seattle versus the Rams. Yeah [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=827.0999999999999s)]
*  Minnesota to trade Minnesota have to be Green Bay Detroit would have to beat I think San Francisco, which I think that they'll do that [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=830.14s)]
*  I don't know about a set of Green Bay [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=836.06s)]
*  But Sunday night we could get Minnesota Detroit would be an awesome game for the one seed for the whole shebang [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=837.6999999999999s)]
*  For the division and Green Bay beats, Minnesota [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=844.58s)]
*  We don't get that right. We would need Seattle, Arizona [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=848.6999999999999s)]
*  Which makes me wonder do the Rams get any calls in Arizona? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=853.98s)]
*  and plus [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=858.74s)]
*  377 Seattle Arizona [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=860.98s)]
*  NBC just just fun. I don't know. I'm just the conspiracy gets [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=863.6999999999999s)]
*  Conspiracy parlay. Yeah, it's a good else, but it's a good [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=868.18s)]
*  If Sean Hockley shows up in Arizona [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=871.9s)]
*  I'm here to tell you right now [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=876.38s)]
*  It doesn't matter the way how long the game goes he'll he'll add in enough time to make sure that this works out [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=878.02s)]
*  So I don't want to do that but I want to match it okay Christmas Day two games I want to target [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=884.54s)]
*  For NBA. Okay, I'm listening [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=890.3s)]
*  The Dallas Mavericks are playing the Minnesota Timberwolves you and I may have placed a big [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=894.54s)]
*  Big wager with Hensh and Sal yesterday [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=900.02s)]
*  we did on the Minnesota under for the season under wins 46 and a half with Indiana over 40 and a half and [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=902.46s)]
*  Then what was the other under we had a Sacramento that was like 41 and a half under so basically we're shorting the Sacramento, Minnesota [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=910.54s)]
*  Seasons and betting on Indiana who beat Golden State last night, Minnesota looked terrible again last night. I [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=918.26s)]
*  Made this joke on on Twitter. I'll make it again [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=924.5s)]
*  Minnesota Minnesota somehow on Christmas Day [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=927.86s)]
*  And it's like you could have their sullen angry energy on your TV or you could just get it from your family [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=931.02s)]
*  But I can't think of a of a worse of a worse Christmas [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=937.48s)]
*  Experience than watching this Timberwolves team right now because they are [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=941.96s)]
*  Miserable together. Anyway, they're playing Dallas money line bet easy any any objections? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=945.48s)]
*  Nope, none whatsoever [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=951.32s)]
*  Poor Minnesota. Yeah, they really had a beautiful thing with towns. They traded them because of the money [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=953.32s)]
*  It was a good spin of the roulette wheel, right? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=958.32s)]
*  The roulette wheel right a good good [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=961.8000000000001s)]
*  It made sense on paper and then Randall comes none of it works. He's miserable. Deepa Chen's is miserable [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=964.12s)]
*  Everyone doesn't seem like they like playing with go bear calmly got a hundred million years old all of a sudden [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=970.12s)]
*  Yeah, you know my my deep NBA [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=976.4000000000001s)]
*  Analytics, it's it's a point guard thing. We thought that DDV would be a solution [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=980.5200000000001s)]
*  It looked on paper to be a beautiful kind of thing. He's not he can't he doesn't do it [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=985.2800000000001s)]
*  Doesn't set them up the way that they need and Connelly is is you know better than fried chicken to borrow a turn from Raheem [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=988.84s)]
*  So Mavs minus 210 and we can put that with nuggets sons the nuggets [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=995.9200000000001s)]
*  minus 152 [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=1001.6s)]
*  So I want to push back on this one a little bit [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=1003.52s)]
*  Okay, let's hear it because I don't like that they played Monday night and then they're coming back for a rematch on [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=1005.84s)]
*  Christmas and Booker didn't play yeah, they night [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=1011.9200000000001s)]
*  and [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=1015.36s)]
*  What's his face Grayson Allen's in concussion protocol? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=1016.8s)]
*  I don't know if he'll be cleared by Wednesday [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=1020.0s)]
*  But I don't like those back-to-back matchups where one team whoops the other's ass and it was close for like a half [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=1022.48s)]
*  Durant and Beal both had 23 points [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=1028.44s)]
*  So you're staying away makes me nervous. I'm happy to stay away [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=1031.96s)]
*  NBA wise one of the things that I absolutely positively think and there's you know [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=1035.4s)]
*  Long story tradition of this the 12 noon game which has a total of 223 and a half [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=1039.84s)]
*  Yeah, those the Knicks in San Antonio [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=1045.84s)]
*  223 and a half as a I mean that's an under isn't it isn't that haven't we learned over the years as you know [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=1048.8s)]
*  I don't do heroin. I don't do cocaine and I don't do basketball over unders [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=1054.76s)]
*  There's three stay away fair enough [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=1060.56s)]
*  tradition of Christmas Day unders and especially that always weird 12 noon and [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=1063.6s)]
*  Nobody's awake, you know people had to cut their Christmas. They're there that is true James early [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=1069.3600000000001s)]
*  It I'm sure it's gonna win. I won't be participating [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=1075.58s)]
*  Okay, fine the Celtics are minus 10 against Philly which is way too high because the Celtics team could lose [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=1079.3s)]
*  Or come close to losing to anybody. They're just getting ready for April Lakers Warriors are a complete stay away to me complete [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=1084.86s)]
*  Stay away. I don't know what to do with that game. All right, so maybe we'll just do the Dallas game [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=1091.94s)]
*  And it was all helpful house. Yeah, we have a C minus two and a half [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=1097.46s)]
*  Oh that so we have a look you could do a little Christmas parlay [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=1102.38s)]
*  Mmm with the Dallas Mavs Moneyline Casey Moneyline Ravens Moneyline Seattle Moneyline a little Wednesday and Thursday [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLOLmblKUQ&t=1106.5400000000002s)]
