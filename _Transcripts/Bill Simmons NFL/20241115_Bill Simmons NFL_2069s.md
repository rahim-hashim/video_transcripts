# Million-Dollar Picks Week 11 With Joe House  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [November 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VZWu4uf3Rs)
*  All right. We're going to talk some million dollar picks.
*  I'm still upset about what happened last week. We basically split
*  last week. And one of the reasons we, even though I felt like we were all over the slate,
*  and we couldn't figure out a good way to bet on the lions. So we did the lions,
*  first half lions game that loss. Yeah. We really liked the dolphins and we tried to get cute.
*  We did dolphins plus four and a half with the over 42 and a half. And of course they,
*  they just figured out a way to not get to 40 points in that game.
*  I don't know what the Rams are doing. So we lost those two, but we hit Eagle's chargers,
*  tees. We had Steelers Washington, we had cards jets. Like, I feel like I have a nice feel for
*  the slate and I like this week and I don't know, do you want to do chiefs bills last or first?
*  Let's do it first. Let's go ahead and just, you know, sort of crush this because
*  I'm having a hard time with this game. I'm going to confess to you right off the top.
*  Yeah. It feels like a bill spot to me. It feels like a great spot for the bills at home coming
*  off of the last two seasons, regular season wins against the chiefs. Um, you know, it, it, it,
*  it matters now look with where the bills are with only two losses, it's kind of crucial
*  in terms of the seating for the AFC. So that would be the argument for, um, the chiefs going
*  all out here. The chiefs are not walking in here, um, looking to concede anything to the bills,
*  but, um, I don't know. It just feels like a bill spot to me.
*  As in a bill's minus two and a half, you'd want to bet that spot and bet against Patrick
*  Holmes as an underdog. No, his, uh, what is he 13 one and one as an underdog career?
*  No, under no circumstances am I betting against. All right. I just wanted to make sure I thought
*  you, I didn't know if you're a buzz house or I just did heroin house. Cause we're,
*  there's no way we're getting it's Patrick. No, no, no, no, no chance. Absolutely no chance.
*  So I do think it's probably going to be a close game. And I was looking at a couple of spots to
*  bump that from a plus two and a half to either a plus three and a half or a plus four and a half.
*  I think the chiefs can also win. It's, it's, I'm just like, I'm saying like we could just bet the
*  money line, but the bills, it's a more important game for them for nine different reasons.
*  That's what I think. And that part worries me. I wonder if the chiefs a month from now,
*  and they have all the weapons back will be a slightly different thing, but I just like
*  the football matchup for them with the, the type of defense the bills have versus what the chiefs
*  have just been good at are these long drives, third and fours, third and sevens, just moving
*  the chains, moving the chains. And I think you can do that against the bet and then go deep on them.
*  I think the fact that Baltimore looks so good against that Buffalo D that time, I don't think
*  that's not nothing like when they went against a really good quarterback, they got kind of torched.
*  So yeah, what scares me like inside the X's and the O's is how hurt Buffalo is at the receiver
*  position. And if they try and establish the run, then you're, then you're in trouble because the
*  chiefs have a dominant defense. It looks like can Kate don't, can Kate might not play. Yeah.
*  And even if he plays his heart, a Mark Cooper's hurt. I don't know what's going to, we're taping
*  this on a Thursday. I don't think this is the right version of the bills team. Right. To,
*  cause I think realistically you need to get to 27 points to beat this chiefs team.
*  Make them put up points back. But anyway, there's a couple of things I have with chiefs plus three
*  and a half or chiefs plus four and a half tied to the lions. Let me ask you this before you do it.
*  Why aren't we just auto teasing the chiefs taking the cheese from two and a half up to eight and a
*  half? I looked at that. Couldn't really find the second team that I felt awesome about. Like you
*  suggested the dolphins. I don't trust the dolphins. I don't trust this Jackie Mike McDaniel. I don't
*  want to put him in a tease. I'll confess. I've had some misgivings, my own self. I don't want to just
*  to like when to a trying to tackle that dude on the interception and it seems like he got
*  hit. I just don't want any part of that. So one of the things I was thinking was you could take
*  the chiefs to plus four and a half. You can do the Detroit first half game bet against the Jaguars,
*  who they're favored by 13 and a half against Mack Jones. That's minus one Oh two. You could do
*  chiefs plus three and a half lions minus two and a half against the Jags. That's minus one 19.
*  Basically, maybe that's by that extra half point. Lions just have to win by three. Yeah. Okay.
*  Is that going to win in Detroit? Nope. No, sir. No, no, he is not. He's not winning. Okay. So I'll
*  mark that down. Next one. Both of us like the Broncos are home for the Falcons and this line
*  is under three and it's a gift from the gods. Denver's defense, first yards per play,
*  second and sacks, third and QB hits their top 10 against the run and the pass.
*  Atlanta's defense, 32nd and sacks, 31st and QB hits, 24th against the pass, 28th against third
*  down. Here's my point. I think Denver's D can chase Kirk a little bit, make some plays and I think
*  Bo Nicks is going to have time to throw and he feels like he's getting a little bit better
*  every week. Nate Tice talked about it. It's turned into like he's a serviceable starter.
*  They can run the ball. I like this rookie that's going to play for them that everybody's grabbing,
*  including in our keeper league, I grabbed them. Estine, whatever his name is. Yeah, whatever.
*  Seems like they're excited about him, but I think they can run the ball. I don't think the
*  Falcons are good. How about that? Not only do I share this opinion, I think the Broncos,
*  I'm going to be looking at some alt lines to lay for Denver. We did that last week.
*  Well, no, I'm going to lay extra to get some juice on it for Denver because I think they might beat
*  the hell out of Atlanta. It's Atlanta to Denver, the altitude, it's outdoors. So the version of
*  the Atlanta offense that has been successful, the wins that they've collected, that's not going to
*  be... And I just think this Denver defense is going to be getting up the field and into Kirk
*  Cousins and making him uncomfortable. And Bo Nicks has shown us, he's got a string of over 200 yard
*  games and- He's competent.
*  Yeah, a couple of touchdowns. I mean, I think it's a great spot for Denver. Plus John Payton's not
*  going to lose three straight games. I mean, they lost to Baltimore. Fair enough. They lost to the
*  Chiefs in a game. They had won until the last play of the game. Well, until the Chiefs cheated.
*  Let's be honest. What the hell was that? Have you seen some of the internet videos of that?
*  Are you allowed to put 19 guys on one side of the line and just
*  knock the left guard flying backwards with seven guys? I thought we outlawed that.
*  That's the A-side team right there. That's the Chiefs. That's the A-side team.
*  So Atlanta on the road, they've had four road games so far. We two, Philly. Game was over.
*  Philly fucked it up and Atlanta scored at the end one by one. Carolina, they killed. Tampa,
*  barely won, easily could have lost. And then New Orleans, they lost. You go look at through their
*  wins and it's just like, they easily could be three. They have six wins. They also easily could
*  be like three and seven. Three plays away from being a three and seven team. I just don't think
*  they're impressive. I thought that New Orleans loss was awful. I don't think there's any difference
*  between these two teams in terms of power ranking and all the rest of it. I prefer Denver. Me too.
*  I think Denver's like, oh, sorry you lost to Baltimore and Kansas City. I still feel like
*  they're the good bad team. I'm in on Denver. So Denver minus two and a half will mark that.
*  I hesitate to bring this one up, but Colts plus three and a half against the Jets.
*  It feels like a unique chance to bet against a downtrodden Jets team that has sucked the soul
*  and life and spirit out of the fans, out of the city, out of the players on the team.
*  The Rogers thing, Tim Kiyone had a thing on ESPN. He had a whole story about the last four weeks of
*  Rogers. You read that and it's like, this is bad. And it was not a lot of smoking gun stories,
*  but it's just like, this sucks. This is gone. It couldn't have gone worse. Their season's over.
*  I don't think they like playing with Rogers. They built the whole team around him and he's
*  banged up and probably broken. And then you have the Colts who were getting points, the Jets,
*  they're 30th rushing the Colts. That's the one way to beat them is to run on them. The Jets are bad
*  at running the ball as anyone has. Breece Hall knows. I just feel like the Colts can get on track,
*  but Anthony Richardson is starting.
*  So here's the thing. And I do want to lean into the Colts, but it would be with caution.
*  There is a bet out there that I think is a tremendous bet. And it's Anthony Richardson
*  over 38 and a half rushing yards. I think he might run for a hundred yards. I'm not suggesting
*  anybody wager on that, but I think that the commitment that Shane Steichen is going to make
*  to getting Richardson's confidence back, the thing that he is best at is moving the football
*  with his legs. They are going to give that man the green light. And the thing that we have seen
*  with this Jets defense again and again and again is they are not tough. That is not a tough defense.
*  They don't like to take on big. What we saw in terms of the Cardinals running the ball
*  right down the Jets throat, the 50 yard play, right before halftime with the Cardinals against the
*  Jets. That's the identity of this Jets defense. I love the Anthony Richardson over 38 and a half
*  rushing yards. That's one of my favorite bets of the weekend. So they're plus three and a half.
*  What if I offered you Colts minus two and a half parlayed with Anthony Richardson
*  over 38 and a half rushing yards is plus 366. I mean, how am I allowed to say fuck yes on this
*  podcast? I mean, you know the answer to that. Because we're talking about I had I love that one.
*  The other way to do that is just do the Colts money line plus 176. That's plus 309.
*  Where do you think Aaron Rodgers is going to go in the Trump administration?
*  He's going to be the ambassador. Where is he going to be the ambassador? The ambassador to
*  He's going to be the ambassador of Ascalusa. Is that Trump come to Mexico?
*  Is he going to South America? Turning into my dad.
*  Ayahuasca? He's going to be the ambassador of Ayahuasca.
*  We can be the ambassador. And Ascalusa.
*  They can send him to Tahiti. Where does he want to go? He's definitely going to get a job
*  in the administration. So Colts plus three and a half with Richardson over 38 and a half is plus
*  209. Let's do that. That's fun. Plus three and a half. It's a field goal game.
*  Okay. Don't you think that's fun? Yeah, that's a good one. Plus every time Richardson.
*  The fun thing about that is it is fun to watch him run.
*  You sure you don't want to do the plus 366 where they win by two and a half?
*  Two in a small, you know, like we did last week. We did. We put 10 grand on some ridiculous.
*  Yeah, both the Giants and somebody else to win. Oh, San Francisco. That lost.
*  Those two teams. All right. By the way, I don't feel like the Colts are that bad. I thought Flacco
*  and I thought it was the right move to start him. Flacco was terrible.
*  It's officially over. I don't know what happened to him in the Browns for those five, six weeks,
*  but he's back to being the Joe Flacco we remembered and love betting against.
*  I tried to do my Ursay impression on Monday because I'm so on our East Coast bias podcast.
*  I'm 1000% positive that Ursay after Richardson tapped out and said that in that press conference,
*  he came downstairs and get this guy, this guy. I can't have this guy.
*  He's a winner. Yeah, he just got back. I can't have a critter running my team,
*  Shane. You got to get this guy. And the change like, okay, okay. It's your team. It's your team.
*  It wasn't the right football decision. It wasn't the right franchise decision, but you know,
*  they did what the owner wanted and now we're back to the football plan and
*  Shane Steichen has the football plan. So we're doing the right thing here.
*  Next one. I think we are in violent agreement. Chargers against the Bengals. Chargers laying
*  minus one and a half Bengals in a must win spot. A very popular public team,
*  explosive offense, fourth passing burrows, been a fantasy God. And yet I love the chargers.
*  Shay, is this our argue pick? I don't know. Here. Here. But the concern is
*  burrow these nuts. We're burrowed these nuts. He is on a heater. He's been incredible. And
*  those weapons are unlike any weapons that the chargers have seen to this point.
*  Yeah, but we don't even know if Higgins is playing.
*  It's still he's got the red flag next to him. Believe me, I have him in fantasy.
*  It's questionable. And they can't run the ball. The Bengals, they can't run the ball.
*  Cannot run the ball. This is the this is the Bengals season because they can't they are
*  behind both the Chargers and the Broncos. And if they lose to either one of these teams, that's it.
*  Seasons over. They can't climb. I take seasons not over. Why? I don't think it's over if they lose
*  the game. Give me the give me the rundown. I think nine wins is going to get the seven seeded in the
*  AFC. Right now, they have four wins. They lose this Chargers game at home Pittsburgh, week 13
*  at Dallas at Tennessee. Those are going to be two wins. Now we're at six. Yeah. Home Cleveland,
*  that's seven. They get to play Denver week 17. That's eight. And then they're at Pittsburgh
*  week 18. So it's not necessary. They just have to split the Pittsburgh games,
*  beat Dallas, Tennessee, Cleveland, Denver. But they need they need these. They need the Chargers
*  and the Broncos both to fall off. They they could take care of Denver by themselves in week 17.
*  Look, it wouldn't be great if they lost this game. I'm not saying it would be. But
*  the reason I like the Chargers is because very quietly Herbert is healthy. He's throwing the
*  ball downfield. They have vertical weapons. And Herbert is speaking of being in his bag.
*  There's a physicality to him. You forget that he's a tough sob six sex. That big boy has played hurt
*  a lot in his career. We've seen him take shots. And he's taking on the personality of Harbaugh
*  a little bit. I like this little bit of a swagger that I'm seeing out of them. I like the idea of
*  the Chargers here. I want to just be cautious. That's all they have six wins. They're playing.
*  This is the hardest part of their schedule. Home since the home Baltimore at Atlanta at KC.
*  So realistically, they probably have to go to and to to really feel good about the playoffs. But
*  this is this is where I've landed. I think the line is two points off. I think they should be
*  three and a half point favorites. Wow. What have the Bengals done to deserve anything?
*  They're poorly coached. Their defense is awful. They have four. They have four wins against teams
*  that if you add up all their victories, not nine victories, there are four wins that come against
*  teams with nine total wins. Their defense 31st in the red zone feels worse. 29th on third down,
*  27th on first down, giving them up. 23rd against the path. I just think I think the Chargers are
*  legit good. And then I'll throw this at you on one sideline. Jim Harbaugh on the other side,
*  Zach Taylor. I just think they have the advantages. And this is going to be a rare Chargers home game
*  where there's not going to be 30,000 of the other teams fans in the building because I think there's
*  going to be 30,000 Bengals fans there. I think people like this Chargers team. There's an energy
*  around them right now. And and I think Herbert's playing great and they could run the ball. I trust
*  their receivers. Their receivers are getting open. Then they're down. So I think to me, this game
*  reminds me of Arizona Jets last week, where I just feel like the lines off about last week. I thought
*  that Cardinals line was was idiotic. And I think this line's idiotic. The Chargers also have
*  Greg Roman in their mix who has all that experience from his time with Baltimore going up against
*  this Bengals team, going up against this Bengals defense. Yeah, I like the Chargers.
*  This seems like a very public bet where people look at it and they go, well, the Bengals need the
*  game and Burroughs playing well, so they're going to get it. And I don't think that's a good reason.
*  The Chargers are a really good football team. I don't think they're on that Chiefs, Ravens,
*  Bills level, but I think they're a notch below. And I think they'd be a really dangerous seven
*  point underdog in a round one playoff game. How about this? I was looking for a possible angle
*  to tease the Bengals, but then you look at the Chargers wins. They're all by margin. All of the
*  Chargers wins have been at least seven points. Their defense gets better as the game goes along.
*  They choke the life out of you. Yeah. All right. All right. So here's the game I really want to
*  dive into. Ravens Steelers. It's in Pittsburgh. Ravens are favored by three. Steelers are seven
*  and two. Mike Tomlin is a home underdog. Whole bunch of reasons to be like, ah, of course we've
*  taken the Steelers all year. I think we've taken them six times a million dollar picks. We have a
*  bunch of futures with them. The thing that worries me house. This isn't the type of team that should
*  succeed against Baltimore because Baltimore 32nd against the pass, right? You want to throw on
*  them. You want to do a burrow did last week. Pittsburgh wants to win like they beat you guys
*  in Washington last week where they want to run the ball, pound the ball, control the clock.
*  Then every once in a while throw deep down one of the sidelines, but when with defense,
*  that's not how you beat Baltimore. You beat Baltimore by throwing the ball in them because
*  they suck on pass defense. And yet Pittsburgh's 26th, but they're passing offense their defense,
*  their top five and a whole bunch of stuff. First down run red zone hits, turnovers,
*  but Baltimore's offense is first and basically anything, everything. And, uh, it just feels to
*  me like Baltimore is going to be able to control this game. And maybe they'll end up Pittsburgh
*  going to split in the series, but I don't like the spot for Pittsburgh. I think this is a bad
*  matchup for them. So how do you see it? So you, we just need to understand what we're walking into,
*  right? Because underdogs in this series, you know, which other team is the underdog 10,
*  one and one against the spread nine and three straight up in the last 12 batches. So just that
*  each of the last five times that the Steelers have been underdogs, they have won outright.
*  And over history, these two guys, Tomlin and Harbaugh, the underdog, if they faced each other
*  32 times, the underdog is 23, six and three against the spread. It's, it's just insane.
*  Pittsburgh, uh, uh, the, the underdog, when it, when it, the line is three points or more,
*  18, two and three between these two guys. So that's what you're up against when you're
*  walking into this. But look, here's the thing. I'm not going to make the whole handicap about
*  one guy. It's just a big deal for Pittsburgh to not have Alex Highsmith because the, what he
*  brings to them pass rush wise, there's a pass pass rush. There's a rush Collins worth. Yeah. He
*  brought a balance, right? That balance. Cause we've seen it where we've, there's been guys
*  missing help. It was missing for a couple of games. Um, and it felt like they were back and now all
*  of a sudden they're not back anymore. There is not a defense on earth that can slow down this
*  Raven's team. It, it, it seems so you have to believe that there's a significant advantage,
*  which is crazy for the Steelers at in special teams. We, we, you know, it's a rarity to talk
*  about Baltimore being behind anybody else in special teams, but they are highly mediocre,
*  highly average because Justin Tucker's fallen off a little bit. Their punter shanked a punt
*  against the Raiders and that is how the Raiders came back in week two. Uh, and the Steelers are
*  doing what they do. I mean, they're, they're third DVO a, uh, on, uh, so maybe it's a stay away.
*  I'd like a teaser leg. Like, to me, I would tease the Steelers up to nine and tease the chiefs up
*  to eight and a half and two and just have these, these classic fist fight almost like Jake Paul
*  and Mike Tyson brought a classic heavyweight brawl and make sure you're getting enough points
*  on both sides of it. And then just let those, these teams do what they do,
*  which is play close games and rest peacefully with your winnings.
*  Yeah, I don't feel great about it. Maybe it's a stay away. Okay.
*  It's probably a stay away because we're trying to talk ourselves into the Ravens and every single
*  piece of data over 20 years. Right. And no, no,
*  Steelers plus three at home is exactly the type of bet that I would do without blinking.
*  Right. Right. I don't think they're gonna be able to run the ball on the Ravens at all. So now we're
*  just putting the game in Russ's hands. You know what the thing to do crappy pass defense.
*  If you really, really, really want to bet the Ravens, make sure that Kyle Hamilton check
*  on a daily basis. How's Kyle Hamilton do it? Right. You're right. You might not play either.
*  What are the reports about how he's feeling, how he's doing? How does he look? Is he, is he a go?
*  Is he not a go? If you have to bet the Ravens, that's the key. So you really like Brown's plus
*  one and a half against the saints. I love it. I, I, it's, it's the Jamis return game.
*  Jamis back to New Orleans, going right to commander's palace and get to sit down with
*  two dozen oysters. Um, it's the Browns off the bi-week. Here's, here's the distinguishing factor.
*  Look at the Browns injury report. I'll tell you quickly, there are no names on it.
*  The Browns, it's the healthiest. This Browns team has been all season long and you know,
*  coming into the season, there was reasonable optimism for the Browns. I think their win
*  total was eight and a half. Um, and so that's a team and the strength was supposed to be in
*  the trenches for this Brown's team. Their defensive, uh, uh, front seven, their offensive line. Well,
*  their offensive line was basically hurt all the way up until this last, you know, two weeks.
*  And they, because of the way the season has gone, they traded his area Smith in the last handful of
*  weeks. But, uh, I think it's just the saints team, they got the, the, the, the new coach bounce.
*  They got rid of Dennis. They won one for the clogger.
*  That's the best. It's an amazing run for the clogger.
*  The Sunday night Bill Simmons podcast with cousin Sal between middle middle coach.
*  Yeah, we've had a good run at coach sick games. Yeah. So the clogger guys win. Yeah. I think
*  the saints are terrible. They are terrible. Are they going to be able to throw three bombs to
*  Marquez Valdez? Scanling? I can't even say the names. Uh, I, I, again, I don't think so.
*  I like, I read you some really fun Cleveland offense versus New Orleans defense matchups for
*  this game. It's going to be hilarious. Cleveland's offense, 32nd and yards per play. New Orleans
*  defense, 32nd and yards per play. Yeah. Cleveland's offense, 28th pass, New Orleans defense,
*  29th pass. There we go. Cleveland's offense, 28th with the run. New Orleans defense, 27th.
*  And then Cleveland's offense, 32nd hits to the quarterback. So last they've given up the most
*  quarterback hits. New Orleans, 27th and hitting the quarterback. So this is like the worst possible
*  offense against the worst possible defense basically. But as you said, Browns are healthier.
*  Nick Chubb, who had a bye week last week, who was finally starting, maybe this is like the Nick
*  Chubb game. Jamis going into New Orleans. I kind of like the Browns. I'm with you. Isn't that fun?
*  Let's do it. Plus the line is so crazy. Yeah. The saints being favored, the cloggers
*  favored. Look at the price. It's like even money to, to, to take the, the favorite team
*  and you have to lay crazy juice if you want to take the, the, the Browns.
*  It's like minus one 25 to get the one and a half points.
*  Yeah. Why is that? The, the brand? Yeah. They're minus one 22 plus one. So
*  so this is a money line bet then. Yes. Yes. Clear minus Browns minus one. Oh wait.
*  Okay. That sounds good. All right. I think we have, was there anything else you liked or no?
*  That was it. That's probably my favorite bet. The Browns because it's, it's so dumb and hilarious.
*  I think the Rams Pat's line is like a point and a half too high toward the Rams. It's Rams minus
*  four and a half, but I don't want to bet it. And I also don't know why we don't have money in the
*  Packers. That is five and a half against Chicago, but it almost looks like a,
*  it looks like a trap game. All right. That's good. So million dollar picks.
*  All right. I have a handle on it. Let me ask you this. If I told you we could do
*  chiefs plus three and a half parlayed with lions minus two and a half minus one 19.
*  And we do chiefs plus eight and a half stewards plus nine tees. Would you want to do both of those
*  or just pick one? Let's do both. Okay. We don't have to do enormous amounts. All right. It's time
*  million dollar picks week 11. Last week we lost $10,000 house. I don't know how we did it. It felt
*  like we were all over the slate. We're still up with $768,000 for the year. First bet Broncos
*  home against the wildly overrated Falcons. This is only a minus two and a half. We think this gets
*  to three by Sunday, right? Broncos by three on Sunday. For sure. For sure. But we're, we're
*  positive. Uh, uh, expected. We, we beat the closing line value here on million dollar picks. Yeah. We
*  do it on Thursday nights. We're grabbing it early. We love the Broncos defense, not sold
*  in the Falcons at all. They could easily be a three win team and, uh, Sean Payton, I just,
*  them at home, Bo Nicks showing some signs of life. They got three running backs going Broncos minus
*  two and a half. That's our first one. Second one is one that house liked Colts plus three and a half
*  against the jets. Just cause we can bet against the jets every week. We're just going to do it
*  until Rogers shut down. That's right. Anthony Richardson is in this game house. You had a
*  theory about what's Stiken is going to do with Richardson. I really think that they're going to
*  put the ball in his hands and let him have the green light to, to, to run early, to run often,
*  and just like reestablish himself, reestablish the team's confidence in him. He's a tough guy.
*  He's going to show them that he's a tough guy. He's going to get the job done and ambassador
*  Rogers can't wait to go off to his exotic destination.
*  So we, uh, that was plus two Oh nine Colts plus three and a half with Richardson over
*  38 and a half rushing yards. It's a great bag. We're gonna put a hundred on that one.
*  Chargers minus one and a half against the Bengals. I love this bet. I think the line should be
*  Chargers minus three and a half. The Bengals, people are just like, Oh, the Bengals, they need
*  the game. They can throw the ball. I am in on the Chargers. I think they are really good, complete
*  well-coached team. They can run it. They can throw it. They have a top five or six defense.
*  And, uh, and I think the Bengals are really one dimensional. They make dumb turnovers.
*  They, they do stupid fourth and two and they go for it. They get stuffed. Their defense is awful.
*  And I think the Chargers win this game outright. So we're putting 200 K on them and the Broncos
*  minus two and a half as well. And then we're going to put, uh, 200 K in the Browns
*  minus one Oh eight against the clogger and the New Orleans saints make the case really fast.
*  Tough spot for the saints with the injuries that they have. The Browns are coming off a
*  by with the clean bill of health. Jamis Winston back to the scene of, of many crimes, none of
*  which had been reported, but he gets to get back to commander palace. Uh, we, we love the Browns
*  offensive line defensive front seven. They're going to put pressure on, uh, Derek Carr,
*  no receivers left except for MVS. Good luck to the saints.
*  A lot of pick six misdemeanors and a lot of, uh, picks and crossing route misdemeanors by Jamis.
*  Last but not least, we're gonna do something a little different, put a little more on this
*  chief's game because it's chiefs bills chiefs getting two and a half. And we're going to tweak
*  this in two different ways for 150,000 each first chiefs up to plus three and a half. We're
*  going to buy a point and combine it with the lions minus two and a half against the Jaguars and Mac
*  Jones. The lions are huge favorites in Detroit. So we're going to use that. That's minus one 19.
*  Then we're going to tease the chiefs to plus eight and a half with the Steelers where we went back
*  and forth. We have to put money on this game. Somehow we've decided this is a touchdown game
*  one way or the other, because we are getting better for so long. We realized,
*  oh, it's in Pittsburgh Steelers are underdogs is a great spot for them.
*  Let's just tease them to plus nine and enjoy it. So we're going to put 150,000 on both of those
*  bets. And the case is it's the chiefs. Their record is what? 27 and one and one as underdogs
*  with my homes. 127. I don't know how many times he's covered it. He's only lost once
*  in the bills home of the 13 seconds game. Bills are a little banged up.
*  I just think the chiefs have a better team. I think the lines insulting. I think my home should
*  be insulted. So we're putting bets on both of those. So to recap, 200 K on Broncos minus two
*  and a half Browns minus one to wait to win outright chargers minus one and a half.
*  Then we're doing the Joe house parlay Colts plus three and a half with Richardson 38.5 rush 100 K
*  to win plus two on nine on that. And then 250 K bets chiefs plus three and a half parlayed with
*  the lions minus two and a half. And then the chiefs plus eight and a half Steelers plus nine as a tease.
*  But before we go, I have to ask you this Joe house, do we do the cousin South special with Steelers?
*  Ravens win first half Steelers win game nine to one on Fandall. How could we three times this
*  year already? How could we not three times already? Criminal negligence for us to sit here with this
*  opportunity, this marquee game and not get it on this cousin South special. It's a must have here
*  on the million dollar 25 K sprinkling. Yes, have to do it required mandatory 25 K on the cousin
*  South Steelers parlay Steelers special. What's he calling it? He got to come up with a great name
*  for it. I mean, brand, he's a master of branding. Special fine. Great. The CSSS. There we go. 25 K
*  and that is nine to one on Fandall. It's hit three times already this year. It'd be hilarious
*  if it hit again. Those are the million dollar picks for week 11.
