# How Great Can This Browns Defense Be? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZbKfJVzTTw)
*  This Brown's defense, which you were calling out before the year. You were saying like watch Jim Schwartz. He's got a lot of toys
*  This is gonna be really interesting
*  They have been so dominant in these three games
*  That I'm starting to wonder everyone's talking about Miami this week and we're gonna talk about them in a second
*  You wrote about them for a visit today. Everyone's talk about Miami. Oh my god historic offense a
*  Historic defense is more sustainable in December in January
*  And I guess my first question is are we focused enough on the Browns right now? I
*  Don't think we are so let's go back
*  So shove gets injured right and everybody males the season and on poor Joe
*  Well, then they played Tennessee and that line was three and a half
*  It was a it was a really stupid line, Tennessee can't move the ball against Ocean City High School
*  I mean, they're not a good offense. I know they beat the Chargers, but that's the Chargers
*  And so they had to throw the ball and this was a coming out game I think for Watson he threw the ball effectively
*  But this defense they would have they could have won the game 12-9. They could have won the game 12-3. They're really that good
*  Would you study Schwartz's career?
*  You've never when he plays the wide nine you've never been able to run the ball on him because he's really good at teach and run
*  Fits, you know everybody you hear this rhetoric bill. Oh, they're in a diamond or an eight man front. Okay, that's great
*  But sometimes if you're if you're on the not on the same level of the eight man front
*  You're really not in an eight man front, you know, your levels are distorted
*  Everything gets kind of it's like a zone if you're not playing it correctly it gets messed up
*  So his run fits are really good and you can't run bootlegs are naked on because his ends are too wide
*  so you take away a whole element of some easy throws for a quarterback and they run to the football and
*  Then when they get into a passing situation now, he's taken Garrett moving them all over the place and he says, okay
*  Who's your worst lineman?
*  Okay, I got that here comes Garrett now you block a one-on-one
*  right other misconception about football is it's like basketball if you have a bad line and
*  Tennessee doesn't have a good line
*  Don't rush three and don't rush four because somebody can double team somebody on three
*  But if you have a shitty line rush five
*  Because that means somebody has to block one-on-one all the time and that's what shorts did and then it gets Garrett
*  I mean he had him on Ted Carras. I love Ted Carras. We drafted him in New England great kid tough guy
*  But one-on-one with miles Garrett, you know drive into the lane
*  That's gonna be two points every time and that's what he did. So this defense is good enough to carry
*  They're faster athletic all Watson has to do is not screw it up
*  So I was looking at the 2000 Ravens
*  Which I think is the benchmark team for can you just win with a great defense and by not making mistakes?
*  They scored three hundred thirty three points and gave up a hundred and sixty five
*  In a whole you know sixteen game season in the playoffs. They only allowed twenty three points in four games
*  So they allowed a hundred and eighty eight points total in twenty games. They had seven games of nine points or less
*  They had four games that year of nine first downs or less
*  Cleveland has three games of nine first downs or less already. Nobody's gotten the ten first downs of them and
*  You can go through and you could say all right week one Burroughs hurt right bad spot from burrow
*  Nobody realizes Cleveland Steve is that good week to?
*  Pittsburgh Pittsburgh scored two touchdowns with their offense, but I you know pick it he's still figuring it out
*  They can't run the ball. Not you know, Iris looks like Trent Richardson right before he traded him
*  All right, that makes sense then Tennessee Tannehill their line stinks
*  So they haven't really so Lamar will be the first real test
*  But right I'm looking at that game and I'm going
*  well Baltimore's as banged up on their offensive line as anybody and
*  They have the speed to stay with Lamar
*  Especially if he tries to move around the pocket like to me this feels like a terrible matchup for Baltimore you agree
*  I agree completely especially if Lindstrom and Stanley are still out and you know
*  You got Schwartz is going to attack the one thing Schwartz is always very good at doing is attacking the protection
*  So not only does he know how to get the matchups, you know
*  So I'm gonna tackle protections on third down then it becomes a really complicated game and he gets three runners
*  Yeah, this will be a hard one because you know now they won't have Gus Edwards to the running back
*  He's in concussion protocol and what we've learned about concussion protocol this year with this five-step rule that they have is you go with it
*  You're not coming out for at least another week. You're gonna out of week. You're not coming out like in three days
*  You know, this is a we like that right? I like the way they're doing it this year
*  I think it's the right way to do it. I think it solves the coaches problem from guessing
*  You don't have to the coach now no longer. I have the guy who are not have the guy
*  He doesn't practice all week. So
*  Eliminates all that crap what think about coaching for a gate once you know, you don't have the guy you can work around it
*  It's when you think you have the guy you can't work around it, right? That's the problem
*  So I don't have a problem with it at all. And I think with what what what we see there
*  Edwards in concussion for they don't have a you know, is Lamar gonna be the guy it's gonna be hard to get on the edge
*  I think with I don't know if they'll get new some back their corner
*  But look Martin Emerson juniors a really good corner wars an outstanding corner, you know
*  I mean they've got talent on all levels on this Cleveland Brown defense
*  They really are and that grass in Cleveland is thick. It's gonna be a slower track and it helps the brownies and
*  The fans like the team and they have a good home field advantage if the fans like the team
*  Yeah, they're only favored by two and a half, which I was surprised by
*  What you said about Watson?
*  I thought it was three and a half really it's two and a half now. It's down to two minutes down. Oh, yeah
*  down to two and a half
*  We said about Watson. I felt the same way and I couldn't tell
*  You know once you that game was over almost to me once it was 13-3. It was like that's it
*  Tennessee can't do anything. They can't run the ball. They're not gonna be able to throw it
*  But he did gain confidence and there's still he still has that physicality to him
*  when he's moving around and guys are bouncing off him and you know, this doesn't look like a you know, the
*  Stereotypical like oh we traded for this older QB. He's 34 now
*  He could so like he's conceivably physically in his prime, but that was the first time I felt like
*  That kind of looked like the Sean. Yeah, right. Did you?
*  Know I thought completely and he was confident he was moving around I thought he really was back now
*  You know, I wrote about him this week. I think he misses will fuller
*  I think he he needs a down-to-field guy that makes plays remember when he was good with will fuller
*  Oh, yeah, will fuller bailed him out a lot of times and maybe Cooper can be that guy
*  But I think the pressure being on them they hey has to throw the ball more effectively
*  Yeah, I mean look that they didn't run the ball. You couldn't run the ball against the Titans
*  I mean that was the one thing people say well, they don't have chub
*  How they're gonna beat the Titans they were beating the run the ball with chub anyway
*  Yes, the Titans are hard to run the ball on you got to throw it on the Titans and you got to prove that and he
*  Did so that's a huge step and Baltimore
*  Look, I mean I wouldn't mention you had like 44 pack
*  I mean it was it was a thousand paper cuts, but they were really good at 22 third downs in that game, Indianapolis
*  So they didn't really make an explosive play, but they made a lot they got a lot of first down
*  They were in third down quite a bit which tells you they were holding on to the ball
*  so if the 2000s read 2000 Ravens is
*  Kind of your your North Star for this team. Do you coach it differently if you're Stefanski? Do you become?
*  way less
*  Aggressive once you have a lead that does are you just doing everything safe? What do you do?
*  I think if you if you're Stefanski, you know that unless we turn this thing over
*  First of all on Monday today's Tuesday, right you sitting in your office and you're playing the team
*  Like let's say you're the you're playing a team, but Cleveland's playing Baltimore
*  you say how many points do you think what's going to take to win the game and
*  You know, let's say if we score 24 we can beat Baltimore
*  Well, then you got to manage the game according because they're gonna have a hard time scoring 24
*  That's what makes the 49ers so good. Think about this
*  Nobody talks about this at all was new ski the punter for the 49ers is the best inside the punter kicker in the league by far
*  He gets he's unbelievable. So it they always move the ball
*  They get it to midfield they get it to their own maybe their own 40
*  Okay, they punt now you have the ball first and ten at your own eight
*  Against that defense. It's hard to go 12 plays down the field and score. It's hard
*  you're gonna screw it up somewhere along the way and
*  If you do it once god bless can you do it three times for 21 points? No chance
*  You're not doing a three. I don't care how good you are. And that's the way the Browns have to play play field position
*  Make them go on a long way. They're not throwing the ball over our head
*  They don't have enough time and you can win a lot of games
*  It's it's it's a lot like you know that the difference between professional tennis and amateur tennis
*  The amateur hits the ball into the net the pro hits shots that the other guy can't return
*  That's the way you have to play like you're not playing conservative you're playing a professional game
*  you're just letting them screw it up and that's what I think the Browns should do and
*  They can do enough with Watson throwing the ball. They have a more as a weapon. They've got
*  Cooper and Joku the tight end is a good player. I mean and this offensive line is good, too
*  Now they like they're not bad in the offensive line. I know they lost Conklin
*  Yeah, Jones stepped in and played well for him. So yeah that to me
*  I thought they could win the north this summer and I even though without chub
*  I think if they could make a trade for another runner I would do that but they're really good
*  I had him as a playoff team, too
*  The more I watch and I do feel like the AFC is wide open and we're gonna talk about Miami in a little bit
*  But we've seen these great offense September October teams and then as the season goes on. Yeah doesn't look as great
*  You
