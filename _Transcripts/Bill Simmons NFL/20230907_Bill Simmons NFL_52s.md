**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2l-pM4jySg)
*  So I have Green Bay as my 11 and 16.
*  Wow.
*  I just like the team.
*  I think they're, they're loaded with dudes on both ends that were picked in high rounds of the draft.
*  I thought, you know, they, what were they finished last year?
*  They were eight and nine.
*  It felt like it was five and 12, but it was eight and nine and they were kind of in, you know, some of those nine losses too.
*  The Rogers thing was just bizarre.
*  It was hung over the team like a black plague.
*  And the schedule is just ridiculously easy.
*  I mean, they're coming out of the gate at Chicago, at Atlanta, then home for New Orleans, Detroit, at Vegas, at Denver, home Minnesota, home Rams.
*  They're so young, man.
*  They're so young.
*  They might be like six and one after the first eight.
*  Come on.
*  Their draft picks have to contribute immediately.
*  I do have them over.
*  I know I'm talking, I'm down on them.
*  I have them at eight and nine, but even that's over.
