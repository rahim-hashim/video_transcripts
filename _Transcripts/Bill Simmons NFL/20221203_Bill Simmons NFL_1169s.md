# Could Tom Brady Shock the NFL by Returning to the Patriots? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [December 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBSfMvZCqes)
*  I think there's a chance Tom Brady comes back to the Patriots next season.
*  Come on.
*  Let's go.
*  Let's go.
*  There's some breadcrumbs being dropped.
*  I've seen some breadcrumbs, but let Bill take the stage.
*  All right.
*  We'll go big picture.
*  We'll go...
*  Sorry, Kyle.
*  This is why you need to be on camera.
*  Why are you saying this to me?
*  I don't know.
*  This is why I have such a great YouTube clip.
*  Let's go backwards.
*  Why does he leave New England?
*  Right?
*  20 years in the same place.
*  You start, you get tired of your boss.
*  You feel underappreciated.
*  You have a wife who wants to get out of Massachusetts.
*  Let's go to Florida.
*  But really it was partly I can't win here anymore.
*  This is why LeBron James left Cleveland in 2010 and then left Miami in 2014.
*  It wasn't I'm coming home.
*  It wasn't about that.
*  It was this best place to win.
*  And the coming home was an extra part.
*  It's an extra piece.
*  Oh, I get to do this.
*  I'm coming up.
*  Now is actually they have the number one pick and they have Kyrie Irving and they have a
*  bunch of lottery picks and you have a chance to win the title in Cleveland.
*  Brady goes to Tampa.
*  Why does he go to Tampa, Schrager?
*  Ultimately, it's a football decision.
*  Why did it make sense?
*  Loaded roster, draft picks in the top 10 every single year and basically the keys to the
*  kingdom.
*  We'll get in all your friends.
*  You can bring Alex Guerrero.
*  You can bring Gronk.
*  You can bring whoever you want.
*  It's yours.
*  Just please join our team.
*  It's a move to win a title.
*  Get away from Belichick.
*  Maybe work on the legacy a little bit.
*  All right.
*  He does it.
*  It wins.
*  It's successful.
*  It's great.
*  But now we're two years later.
*  He's going through a divorce.
*  You start to really look around and see who are my friends.
*  What have I done with my life?
*  What matters?
*  What's my legacy?
*  Is my legacy?
*  I'm just the greatest quarterback ever.
*  Who do I belong to?
*  Who are my people?
*  And you look around your families and tatters.
*  You're on this Tampa Bay team that sucks.
*  We're going to talk about them in million dollar picks later.
*  You got your title out of them, but you're not getting another title out of them.
*  You know, thought about going to Miami.
*  That door is closed.
*  They have a quarterback, too.
*  Niners.
*  They have Trey Lance, Jimmy G.
*  You can't go home to San Francisco.
*  You start looking at that Pat situation again.
*  What happened?
*  What?
*  Four or five weeks ago, who shows up at Bob Kraft's birthday party?
*  On a Friday night.
*  During the week.
*  On a Friday night.
*  Friday night.
*  Friday night.
*  Before a Tampa Bay Bucks game.
*  Why would somebody do that, Peter Schrager?
*  Why?
*  Somebody who truly loves the owner in the franchise.
*  Now you start thinking, where was I?
*  Where was I happy?
*  Where did I belong?
*  Who are my people?
*  And it's the Patriots fans.
*  What's the best thing for my legacy?
*  Oh, I could just I Peter out on the seven and 10, eight and nine Bucks team.
*  I lose in round one.
*  Then I go to Fox.
*  I don't think he wants to go to Fox.
*  I just think he's on the wrong team.
*  He needs an offensive line.
*  Well, the Pats have an offensive line.
*  He needs tight ends to have those.
*  He needs a running back who can catch the ball out of the backfield.
*  How about Ramondre Stevenson?
*  How about a bunch of receivers that can do some stuff?
*  How about a young team that is probably like one more year away from being decent?
*  He goes there for a year, comes back home, puts a bow on it.
*  I'm a patriot for life.
*  This is where I want to be.
*  Bob Kraft is the most meaningful relationship I've I've had as an adult.
*  He's like a second father to me.
*  And then you start floating out that I didn't really want to leave in the first place, but my wife wanted me to leave.
*  And, you know, this divorce is going to probably get uglier and uglier.
*  You start making her you paint in certain things.
*  I never wanted to go.
*  I left because of my family, my family, my wife didn't want to be here anymore.
*  Now you're shifting it.
*  Guess who's guess who's embracing him with open arms?
*  New England, Massachusetts, Boston, every patriot fan.
*  Tom Brady's back for one more year.
*  One more time.
*  Let's put a bow in this.
*  An eighth title.
*  Let's do this.
*  Mac Jones.
*  Do you want to be tutored by Tom Brady for a year?
*  How's that sound?
*  Bradley Zappi.
*  You're just going to be wearing a headset this year.
*  But Bradley Zappi.
*  Bradley and Bailey Zappi.
*  Bailey Zappi, too.
*  He's also going to learn shit.
*  Bailey Zappi.
*  Put a headset on.
*  Just learn from the goat for a year.
*  Oh, my God.
*  It's so glad to have him back.
*  TB 12.
*  Fine.
*  Belichick and Brady together.
*  This is how it has to end.
*  The Shawshank reunion.
*  This is Dirk Diggler coming back to Jack Horner's house at the end.
*  They always come back, Peter Schrager.
*  I'm just saying.
*  Don't rule it out.
*  Brother, I like it.
*  Let me let me give you a little validity on this thing.
*  And Kyle, just say I did not I did not tip you off on any of this.
*  No.
*  And there was like a sprinkling of this this earlier this week online that has kind of made its way to me and be like, well, you know, some of the people in Tampa and New England, what are they saying?
*  And I'm like, I haven't heard it from anyone.
*  However, I did go through an exercise on Good Morning Football where I listed the free agent quarterbacks for twenty twenty three.
*  And I said, Lamar is coming back to Baltimore.
*  They'll figure it out.
*  But it's an interesting class because you've got Sam Darnold now at twenty five years old who can maybe redeem, you know, rectify his career elsewhere or stay in Carolina.
*  You got Baker.
*  You've got this Heinecke now who suddenly you've got Daniel Jones potentially.
*  You've got Garoppolo.
*  And I go through this. I go.
*  It's an interesting class when going into the season.
*  I don't think we thought that.
*  And I got multiple texts, not one multiple texts from people who watch our show around the league saying you forgot Brady.
*  You forgot Brady. You forgot Brady.
*  So everyone's assumption that this is Brady Swan song and he's going to go out and just be in a booth next year calling, I don't know, Washington commanders versus the Eagles on a week seven game.
*  That deal with Fox, that's out there.
*  I think that's out there when he wants to take that deal.
*  I don't think there was.
*  Well, what was the timing of that deal?
*  The timing was they're about to talk to their investors.
*  We need some sort of something.
*  Hey, is it OK if we announce this?
*  It seemed pretty half-assed and rushed.
*  I don't know the details.
*  I'm a Fox employee.
*  I will not go into the fact that it was timed along the earnings call.
*  And after Buck and Aikman left, that is not my place to say anything.
*  I will say this.
*  They're expecting him to eventually join Fox Sports, but there is no hard date of like, all right, the second Super Bowl is done.
*  Tom Brady is going to be here.
*  Now, what he signed on for was he'd attend some investor relations events.
*  He would be the public face of it.
*  He could still do that and still be the quarterback of another team.
*  As for the Patriots side of it, wait, hold on one more thing on the Bucks pushes out Bruce Arians.
*  Let's be honest.
*  He did that.
*  That happened.
*  They bring in Todd Bowles.
*  Hasn't been great.
*  That performance last week of Bowles and left which and the whole Tampa coaching staff was awful.
*  And there's just no way Brady comes back to the Bucks.
*  I think that is the one prediction I am 100 percent on that he will not play in Tampa Bay next year.
*  And then if you start looking around, well, where would he go?
*  All of the teams he'd want to go to are gone, which brings me back to the path.
*  So go ahead.
*  OK, so then you go through those teams and you say, OK, what teams might have holes at quarterback?
*  You start looking.
*  The guys in the AFC West are pretty much spoken for.
*  Would he go to McDaniels?
*  And maybe it's like a I don't think it's either.
*  I don't think he's going to Vegas to like I just don't see.
*  I know the same situation like I know a lot of team.
*  You're not winning a title with that.
*  Then you're like, all right, in the division, it's really tough in the AFC East right now.
*  You've got two. You've got this great thing like what's the worst division in football?
*  It's actually the division he's in right now.
*  So would he go to Carolina with Tepper where there's all sorts of come on actual money?
*  I don't know if he wants to New Orleans.
*  I know. Stop. You know, you start the Giants are like mildly interesting, but I don't think it solves the am I guaranteed contender problem?
*  Not that the Pats do, but at least the Giants puts them in New York.
*  It's a really fun topic and it's really fun for us.
*  I think the other part is he's got a son in high school in New York City right now.
*  Yeah, he'd be closer to the last time I checked closer to New England.
*  And there is this feeling of like I said it multiple times.
*  I think you did, too.
*  If he had walked off after that Rams loss in the playoffs where he took his team back from 24 points and they had a great ending, great ending, great ending.
*  Like Brady at his last game, like gave it everything.
*  And then Cooper Cup and Stafford on their own miracle run had one more play in them.
*  And that's how it ends. Fine. I don't you mentioned it.
*  This is the worst ending possible. He's going to go out on a losing team.
*  He fires his coach. He's getting divorced.
*  They're like what? 27th in the red zone.
*  It's not a fun season.
*  You had Matt Balani on after the Bob Iger news.
*  And I love that you started an A block on a Monday morning talking about Iger because like that's a point.
*  But the point was like how what's your legacy?
*  What are you going to go out and like I think it matters and I think it really matters to Brady.
*  So I don't know if it's Patriots and I think it's a cool story.
*  But like I'm not sure I see Brady ending his career on a seven in, you know, a seven and ten Buccaneers team that lost in the wildcard round to Dallas.
*  You know what I mean? And for people who think he doesn't care about his legacy, first of all, that's insane.
*  Every great athlete does.
*  Second, this is a guy who trademarked TB12 who felt like his mission wasn't was just to prove that greatness could be sustainable for more than just him.
*  And like he does care about this stuff.
*  Kyle.
*  When you think about Brady's legacy and he comes back to New England for one last year, maybe he appreciates Belichick a little bit more.
*  Right.
*  It's like, you know, I've had I've had Bruce Arians skipping out at 430 because he wanted to get nine in.
*  I've had Todd Bowles just flatlining during as we have a seven point lead.
*  I've had I've seen the other side.
*  This so Belichick side.
*  Maybe I underrated a little.
*  Also, they've won when you've won multiple times with somebody.
*  I don't care if they guys fucking hate that guy.
*  I'm so tired of him.
*  You still have like ties and connections with them.
*  And then the craft thing is the big thing to me because that's probably one of the best relationships he has.
*  So, Kyle, as this is all laid out, first of all, it gets announced Tom Brady is back.
*  What's your reaction?
*  Here we go.
*  I mean, I've enjoyed the last.
*  I love rooting for him.
*  I mean, the Super Bowl was like, you know, magical for me in my own little way.
*  But it's been really nice knowing when the cliff comes on, like when we hit the cliff, it's not my problem anymore.
*  I've been actually pretty good at divorcing now.
*  I really like that.
*  I super enjoyed that part of, you know, the close games and the bad throws and, you know, whatever the losses.
*  That's been really nice that I can sort of mean uncle now.
*  I'm not a parent.
*  You know, I can just sort of just go home.
*  So that was really nice.
*  And it was sort of like getting through like a hard semester and then being done with it.
*  And so I wouldn't want to go back to school and take a test right now.
*  But that's what it sort of would feel like if he came back.
*  And then the other thing is like, is he going to be cool that Matt Patricia and somebody else is what is it?
*  Joe Judd's are are now calling the plays like is that sort of a disaster a little bit for him?
*  His eyes, I wonder.
*  How about offensive coordinator Cliff Clinksbury?
*  So we're just throwing people.
*  Did you see did you see Schrager blink when I threw that out?
*  Shaker, who who who kind of our buddies together a little bit.
*  Tom Brady and Cliff.
*  Yeah, they went to the Derby one year together.
*  They went to Baker Bakers Bay in Bahamas.
*  They've got stories.
*  I have great stories with them.
*  They'll probably I think would probably figure out an offensive coordinator, make them happy.
*  And then, you know, I don't think they have they would have to trade anything.
*  Right. It's a fun thought exercise.
*  But I do think I think one more important.
*  Let me add a couple more things to this, because I why not?
*  I'll enter the bag and let's just see.
*  Yeah, let's do it.
*  He was in a conversation with the Miami Dolphins to potentially be their quarterback.
*  And they had his agent, Don Yee, who also represents Sean Payton.
*  They all there were conversations.
*  This isn't like a crazy idea that Brady behind the scenes would maneuver something.
*  He's already done it once before.
*  Right. And he did it with the Tampa coach as well.
*  Yeah, he did that with going to Tampa.
*  And then we found out from who had the Vegas revelation.
*  Yeah, it was revealed that like on the barber shop when he said that.
*  Oh, it was no, it was Dana White.
*  Was that what it was?
*  Dana White talking to Gronk.
*  Talking to Gronk about how Brady almost ended up in Vegas.
*  And then that one fell apart.
*  So Brady's been maneuvering this whole time.
*  And I do feel like I do think he cares about the legacy thing.
*  I don't think he wants to go out this way.
*  And I think I think going back to the path solves a lot of issues for that dude.
*  So I work with Jason McCourty and Jason's lovely Jason's brother on Thursday night.
*  He played his 200th game and started every single game and Kraft came out during the week and came out with a collage.
*  And we're sitting there at the set and I say to Jason, I'm like, you know, not every team does that.
*  And he's like, RK came in.
*  He's like, that's that's our guy.
*  And I'm like, yeah.
*  And he's like, I only played there three years.
*  But like, you have no idea the love that we have for that owner and like what he means to us all.
*  And I'm like, it's good.
*  I'm with Danny Amendola last weekend.
*  The two of us went out.
*  He was in L.A. promoting this Fox show, Special Forces.
*  Fox with my eyes.
*  I'm watching that.
*  We go out for dinner and I'm like, do you still talk to the Patriots guys like, you know, I went to different teams afterwards, Miami, Detroit and, you know, Houston.
*  He's like, but Kraft, man, that's our guy.
*  Like, there is something special about that Robert Kraft relationship with the players when they won that I think it's universal, but it's got to be even stronger with Tom Brady.
*  I'm just throwing throwing something to the fire here.
*  I'm glad you brought up Kraft because that's the last piece of this.
*  So something very interesting has happened in the Boston sports scene.
*  The Celtics are the dominant team and the Bruins are really, really good too.
*  Right. And it's turning the Celtics Bruin thing.
*  So you have the Pats playing Buffalo.
*  We're taping this before the Pats Buffalo game today.
*  And if the Pats lose their season, it's probably over.
*  The Celtics own the town.
*  Tatum is the most popular, biggest athlete in the town by far.
*  I have no feel for Boston sports.
*  So you tell me that.
*  I'm just getting, I'm giving you, he's Tatum's the guy.
*  So I had my dad and my uncle went to see the Celtics Heat last night and they had Prince William and Kate were there sitting courtside.
*  And my dad, the owner sat right in front of my dad, like four rows in front.
*  Tatum went over and talked to them before the game and he walked away and he was just locked in.
*  He had 28 in the first half.
*  My uncle Bob, because they FaceTime me after they were like, Tatum like wanted to put on a show for those.
*  It was like, like real greatness from Tatum.
*  For the owners or for the Royals?
*  No, for the Royals.
*  These Royals are here.
*  I'm going to put on a fucking show for them.
*  He dropped 28.
*  Like Tatum's like a god right now.
*  And I think Kraft sees this.
*  Kraft was in this position where it was like, it was them and the Red Sox, it was the Celtics for a couple of years, but it was always the Pats first.
*  Now they're third.
*  And they're not as, they're still, it's a football city.
*  I get it.
*  They're always going to be relevant.
*  There's always going to be Mack versus Zappi arguments, stuff like that.
*  But Kyle, what flips the script more than Tom Brady coming back?
*  This would do it.
*  It's definitely shocking.
*  And I just want to put, I would absolutely accept him back.
*  And I know Brady would love a chance to squash a Pats quarterback that's been drafted by us.
*  So he'd love to do that one more time.
*  Well, look at some of the stuff Kraft's done.
*  Like even like the Meek Mill thing where he was like passionately trying to get Meek Mill out of prison.
*  I think if Kraft looks at this and goes, you know what?
*  This is great.
*  This would be great.
*  This is a great ribbon to put on this giant present of the Tom Brady era.
*  I'm going to make this happen.
*  Tom's in a not great place.
*  His marriage just fell apart.
*  He's had the worst 2022 possible.
*  I'm going to be there for him.
*  I'm going to work it.
*  I'm going to try to get him back.
*  I think it's possible.
*  I'm throwing it out there because I know it's possible.
*  Brady's got a new clothing line.
*  Brady Brand.
*  He's got the TB12.
*  You know who Kraft's best friend is these days?
*  The best friend is Michael Rubin from Fanatics.
*  I'm talking they are inseparable.
*  If you could somehow introduce that whole world to, I mean, I mean, it's Michael Rubin.
*  But like this is no brainer if he's trying to get into the sports apparel and trying to get into that world as well.
*  And in the Hamptons every summer, Michael Rubin throws this huge bash.
*  You know who guest number one is?
*  Robert Kraft.
*  You know who guest number two is?
*  Bon Jovi.
*  And you know who hosted Kraft's birthday party this past summer?
*  80th Surprise birthday party with Edelman there and the McCordys there and Brady there.
*  Michael Rubin.
*  I feel like this is if Brady's got to have a future like long on and doing the clothing stuff and doing the marketing, all this stuff.
*  Like, dude, there's a lot of stuff that makes a lot of sense here.
*  Now, the question is, does does you know, does Belichick want Brady back?
*  And that's the big thing, because I think Belichick ultimately it was an understanding that this was where this is going.
*  But like there was no warm and fuzzy pitch to Tom Brady at the way on the way out.
*  It wasn't like, hey, let's go for one more run here.
*  And Brady being like, no, it was I think they both knew it was time to move on and Belichick didn't fight for it.
*  The Alex Guerrero piece was interesting.
*  Hold on to the Belichick thing.
*  Yeah.
*  Belichick's a history guy.
*  He fucking loves the history of the NFL.
*  He does.
*  Really more than anybody.
*  He loves it.
*  He loves it.
*  He loves history.
*  He knows like he could tell you all the coach wins over the years.
*  What the fuck is this?
*  The Akron Zips.
*  Oh my God.
*  And he gets like the big picture piece of this.
*  And I think he would embrace it because let me tell you something, they're not winning the Super Bowl with the team they have.
*  And if you put if you even put this year's version of Brady on this team, they would have been better.
*  But I just think I think there's too many arrows that are pointing a certain way for us not to take this seriously.
*  We've dropped a lot of information on this podcast this year that has been successful.
*  I think both of us pretty plugged in on this stuff too.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm not discrediting you.
*  Like Robert Sarver not wanting to sell the Suns to Iger and now Iger's back at Disney.
*  Like I would just take this stuff seriously.
*  I don't bring this up just out of nowhere to get aggregated.
*  So I say the same.
*  I say the same things, Bill.
*  Unlike our show, I'm like, I don't say it if I don't think there's something to it.
*  You're throwing there's smoke.
*  I'm just telling you.
*  All right.
*  We could talk about this.
*  You could talk about this.
*  Good morning, Mayor.
*  I'm excited for Jason's thoughts on good morning football tomorrow on this.
*  Of course, I will ask him.
*  But real quick on like Alex Guerrero.
*  So if you don't know, he's brought Brady's personal guy.
*  William McGinnis brought him in.
*  He was always part of it.
*  But like there was a conflict of whether how much access Guerrero had and who got to go and work out with Guerrero.
*  And if he was working with the Patriots, trainers not.
*  When he got to Tampa, it was like have the building, have a shirt, have an office, have everything.
*  I think that Guerrero does still have a huge presence with the TV 12 stuff up there.
*  And I'd wonder if Belichick would loosen up a little bit.
*  And I know at the end there, they actually did come together and it was OK.
*  But like if Brady comes in and is like, I'm only coming back if my guy has full access again, if Belichick would be willing to say, yeah, you know what, whatever it takes.
*  Belichick is old and he's turning into a softie.
*  He's got two fucking kids working for him on the team.
*  Come on.
