# Million-Dollar Picks: Super Bowl Edition | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI)
*  All right. Million dollar picks. Super Bowl edition presented by FanDuel Sportsbook. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=0.0s)]
*  We don't have house this week because he is in New Orleans. He's hanging out with Sal and with [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=4.48s)]
*  Van and all these ringer dudes, the fantasy guys. And it just hurts my feelings. He didn't have time [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=9.6s)]
*  for us. I'm going to carry on. I have a bunch of stuff I like, but I wanted to talk big picture [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=14.4s)]
*  about what I was seeing from the game because I stared at this game, I don't know, for 10 days. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=20.8s)]
*  And I just kept thinking Philly has more talent. Philly has more talent. Philly is better all over [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=25.52s)]
*  the place. The only things that you wouldn't give Philly the advantage are coaching, QB, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=30.64s)]
*  pedigree in late game crunch time situations. So I thought I was going to take Philly for about a [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=37.76s)]
*  week. And then I thought about more and more. I went to the playoff game. We manifesto. I looked [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=44.56s)]
*  at all the rules. Rule number one, first rule, aware of the looked a little too good the previous [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=48.72s)]
*  playoff round team that was Philly going against this Washington team that already was probably [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=54.16s)]
*  lucky to make the conference title game to begin with and then had a couple of big injuries. And [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=58.959999999999994s)]
*  Philly looked awesome. Rule number five, but where are the everybody believes in us team and the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=63.36s)]
*  nobody believes in our QB, but us team. So Casey's a little bit of the everybody believes in us team, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=68.0s)]
*  just because everybody's like Casey, you can't go against my homes. Philly's got a touch of the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  nobody believes in our QB, but us stuff. Although I don't know, Hertz is making 50 million a year [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=77.76s)]
*  and he gets taken high in fantasy drafts and people know he's good. So Casey a little bit, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  Philly a little bit, but I'm not too sold on any of them. Rule number 10, when in doubt, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=89.28s)]
*  gravitate toward one pick that would screw over the most gamblers and experts. And we definitely [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=93.84s)]
*  go against the single worst gambler you know. Again, there's some Casey stuff. I still feel [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=97.84s)]
*  with the people, just the infrastructure three P don't go against my homes. I still feel like [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=105.84s)]
*  when we get closer to game time, I think this line's going to move. I think it's going to move [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=111.2s)]
*  toward Philly right now. It's still Casey minus one and a half. So I don't think this comes into [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  play. There is a prop that I want to hit when we do props that I think qualifies for rule number 10 [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  rule number 16, take one last look at the quarterbacks and remember there's plenty of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=126.0s)]
*  time to bet against any QB or coach except for the super bowl where you don't have a lot of time. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=130.72s)]
*  Take one last look at the quarterbacks. Mahomes hurts. What happens in a three point game with [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=136.08s)]
*  nine minutes left and Casey's down three and they have the ball and they're driving. And you realize [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=143.04s)]
*  you bet on Philly and you didn't have Patrick bombs and Andy Reed. You just have to factor that [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=148.88s)]
*  in. And you also have to factor in rule number 17. Don't try to be a hero. Just try to win money. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=152.88s)]
*  The hero move is to take Philly and to say, this has been the best team. When you think about it, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=159.04s)]
*  they only had three losses. They could have, there were three plays away basically from being [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=165.84s)]
*  undefeated for the season. They're loaded everywhere. They're going to lay the smack [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=169.44s)]
*  down. And the only reason you're not going to take them is because of Mahomes and Reed. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=173.68s)]
*  The counter is Casey has just been spectacular at winning close games against teams where they do [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=178.56s)]
*  all the little things correctly and they make the little coaching decisions correctly. And [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=184.88s)]
*  they always get one little break around halftime when the other team does something stupid and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=188.96s)]
*  maybe there's a bad special teams player. They get one fumble. They always kind of hang around, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=192.96s)]
*  hang around, hang around and take care of business in the fourth quarter like they did with Buffalo. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  Mahomes is 17 and three in the playoffs career. He's 17 and zero in the last 17 one score games. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=202.0s)]
*  That zero means no losses. This team just takes care of business all the time over and over again. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=208.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, Philly, their best wins this year, Green Bay twice, Washington, they went two and one, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=214.8s)]
*  Baltimore, they beat by five and Cincy. So the record is awesome. The stats are awesome. The [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=220.16s)]
*  fact that they're three plays away from being undefeated is notable. Their defense has looked [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=225.28s)]
*  great. And yet you can make the case Casey has just had a much tougher schedule, a much bigger [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=231.12s)]
*  bullseye in them and over and over again has delivered. So I was trying to think, I always [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=236.32s)]
*  tried to do this with the Super Bowl. I do scenarios, best case, worst case, because I [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=241.84s)]
*  started leaning toward the chiefs over the weekend. Best case scenario, comparing the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=245.92s)]
*  chiefs to Brady in the past, because I think there's a lot of similarities, including like [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=253.11999999999998s)]
*  the infrastructure, the coach, the experience and big games, all the veterans you have, just the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=256.88s)]
*  ability to just pull out these close games over and over again. What Brady Super Bowl win would [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=262.24s)]
*  this be like for Mahomes? And I settled on Patriots 28, Seattle 24, ironically, 10 year [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=267.59999999999997s)]
*  anniversary of that game this week. Really great YouTube clip that they Patriots put up with all [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=272.72s)]
*  this extended audio and video stuff from the game. I watched the whole thing. I made my dad watch it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  I think it's probably my favorite Patriots one of all the wins that has the Malcolm Butler game. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=285.52000000000004s)]
*  Anyway, they're down 10. They win the game by four, 28 to 24. It was a Pick'em line. So similar to [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=290.0s)]
*  this 47 for the over under pretty close to this. It was a game that had 10 punts, three turnovers, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=296.32s)]
*  seven touchdowns and a field goal. So 10 possessions on each side. That feels a little [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  similar to what I think the game's going to go on Sunday. Patriots couldn't really run the ball. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=307.59999999999997s)]
*  21 for 57 running it, but 37 for 50 for three 28 passing. That feels like what's going to happen in [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=313.12s)]
*  this game for them. I don't think they're going to be able to run the ball that well against the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=320.71999999999997s)]
*  Eagles. And I think the Eagles are going to try to try to push them to do short, medium passes. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=323.76s)]
*  Just keep trying to move the ball downfield and eventually we're going to get a sack or a tip or [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=330.56s)]
*  we'll break up a play something, but just take your time going down the field. Seattle on the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=334.48s)]
*  other side in that game, 29 for 162 from the run for the run, which kind of feels like what might [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=339.59999999999997s)]
*  happen with Barkley. They were 12 for 21 passing for 247. That feels the ballpark of what usually [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=345.92s)]
*  happens within a Hertz Eagles game. The Pats were eight for 13 on third down big time of possession [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=351.84s)]
*  for them. 33 46 because it was a lot of the short medium completions that just kept the clock moving. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=357.11999999999995s)]
*  Brady ended up 37 50 for three 28. So close game. They had to throw the ball a lot because they [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=362.88s)]
*  weren't able to run it. And then they took care of business down the stretch. And then Malcolm [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=370.47999999999996s)]
*  Butler came up with the most famous play in the history of the super ball. I think that if the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=374.79999999999995s)]
*  chiefs win, I don't think it's a big win. I don't think they win by 10 plus. I think the game is [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=380.0s)]
*  tight in the fourth quarter and they pull it out. All right. What would be the worst version of the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=384.48s)]
*  game for the chiefs? What bad Mahomes loss would this be like? That's obvious. That's bucks 31 [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=389.44s)]
*  chiefs nine. That was the super bowl result. Casey favored by three. They ran the ball a little bit [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=395.28s)]
*  in that game. 17 for 107 26 for 49 passing. Mahomes was okay, but he had a couple of turnovers [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=400.64s)]
*  and then Tampa ran the ball on them. 33 for one 45 only eight incompletions for Brady. No turnovers [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=407.36s)]
*  took a big lead, held them off, took over the game in the second half with their pass rush. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=414.47999999999996s)]
*  And Casey just couldn't do anything. Nine points. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=419.91999999999996s)]
*  I'm a little scared of that result for this. I almost feel like if you're taking the Eagles, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=424.56s)]
*  you got to think they're winning by 10 plus that's the they're not. I don't think winning a close [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=429.52s)]
*  game against Mahomes and the chiefs in the fourth quarter, which makes me think if you're taking [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=434.56s)]
*  the Eagles, just take the minus nine and a half at plus three 50 and get some juice on it and root [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=439.68s)]
*  for a game like that bucks game, the 31 to nine game. I am looking at this as a chiefs win [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=444.88s)]
*  and a nail biter of a game. When you break down everything, Casey's run versus Philly's run [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=454.4s)]
*  defense advantage. Philly not great. Casey short pass it versus Philly short defense even [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=460.4s)]
*  explosive versus explosive D Philly Philly run versus Casey's run defense. Slight advantage to [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=465.68s)]
*  Philly Philly short pass versus Casey short defense. Slight advantage to Philly and then Philly D [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=472.24s)]
*  passing versus Casey's deep pass defense. That's an advantage to Philly because Casey gives up [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=478.48s)]
*  explosive plays every, every game. They give up at least one big one. So all of the unit versus [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=483.52s)]
*  unit advantages are toward Philly. And yet the QB you're giving them the advantage, the coach [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=489.28s)]
*  you're giving Casey the advantage. So there's two for Casey and then the late game. And then there's [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=496.0s)]
*  all the stats that came out this week about hurts, how he does against pressure and the blitz. The [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=500.4s)]
*  chiefs are going to pressure him hurts against spags almost has to be its own matchup that you [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=505.28s)]
*  have to think about. Then you think like 132 Mahomes starts. He's only lost by eight plus points, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=510.79999999999995s)]
*  five times. So if you think the Eagles are going to win this game and you don't think they're going [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=517.28s)]
*  to win a close game, that means it's a blowout, which means it's something that basically happens [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=523.52s)]
*  one out of every 26 chiefs games. So they'd really have to kick ass. There's some advantages for the [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=530.48s)]
*  Eagles. Number two, eliminating explosive plays, according to show Kapadia, um, really good tackling [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=535.28s)]
*  team. And then they have that recipe that used to work against Brady in the past. And I think the [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=542.24s)]
*  Eagles have it where you just rush the four, they're constantly pushing the pocket. And then you have [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=547.92s)]
*  the other seven guys can basically be doing all kinds of, you know, are they blitzing, are they [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=552.48s)]
*  bouncing back, are they pretending to blitz and then blitzing? Um, that's what used to frustrate [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=556.64s)]
*  Mahomes. So I, uh, uh, Brady, so I feel like, uh, there's some recipe stuff here, but ultimately I [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=563.2s)]
*  just can't take, I can't take hurts over my homes and I can't take Siriana against Reed. And if [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=569.68s)]
*  anything has taught us about this chiefs team over the years, they just benefit from dumb shit from [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=575.52s)]
*  the other teams or just the place shouldn't have made the moment that you can't believe this [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=580.7199999999999s)]
*  happened. And it just, it always works out for them. I'm not going to talk about the refs. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=586.0799999999999s)]
*  So here's what I'm doing for a million dollar picks. We lost 211,000 last week. We are still [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=589.8399999999999s)]
*  up $1.071 million for the season. I'm going to try to double it. We're going to bet 500 K in the [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=595.28s)]
*  chiefs minus one and a half. We're going to bet a 250 K parlay. Listen to this one. Eagles plus [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=602.0s)]
*  eight and a half. Mahomes 200 plus passing yards under 60.5 points. So it's a little bit of a hedge [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=608.8s)]
*  against that chiefs minus one and a half. Cause I think the game's going to be close and I'm going [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=617.6s)]
*  to try to middle it with that parlay and that parlay is dead even unfundle. So doing those two [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=621.12s)]
*  and then 50 K on the following Superbowl props. Ready? Hertz, anytime touchdown minus one 15. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=628.32s)]
*  I just, at some point the tush pushes happening near the goal line. That's just the way this goes. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=637.44s)]
*  Mahomes over five and a half carries minus one 28. You go back, you look at all the super bowl sound. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=642.08s)]
*  I talked about this on the Superbowl props. He uses his legs in every big game and even if [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=648.24s)]
*  he doesn't get to five and a half carries, it's five instead of five and a half. So the odds are [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=654.08s)]
*  in your favor on this, especially if they're going to rush for, and he's going to be able to [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=658.16s)]
*  scramble around and buy himself some time. Think about the Eagles defense. If they get a little [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=661.84s)]
*  tired in the fourth quarter, who knows? I just think he gets the six carries. I like that a little [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=666.4s)]
*  more than the yards because the yards, if they had the lead, the kneel down, start cutting in the [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=670.24s)]
*  yard total, not doing that. Mahomes over 11 and a half yards for biggest rush taking that. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=674.24s)]
*  I'm also taking Hertz over 11 and a half yards for his biggest rush. Figure one of those guys [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=681.52s)]
*  is rushing for 12 yards, maybe hit both worst case scenario, you split them. Chris Jones sack plus [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=686.64s)]
*  one 36. We talked about this on Sunday line pushes forward. Hertz holds the ball, holds it too long. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=691.6800000000001s)]
*  And then all of a sudden Jones gets them. Both teams get a fourth down conversion minus one 24. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=697.2s)]
*  I think there's probably going to be a point in this game where both teams have to get a [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=703.52s)]
*  little bit aggressive because they're going to be worried about what happens if the other team gets [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=707.52s)]
*  the ball back. So even fourth and ones, fourth and twos, I just think both teams are getting a fourth [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=712.48s)]
*  down conversion. And then we have a boost on fan duel that I'm just going to jump on for 50 K. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=716.24s)]
*  Casey wins Mahomes over 225 yards of passing, which you can use the profit boost token and go nuts on. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=723.1999999999999s)]
*  And then I have some small 25 K Superbowl props. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=730.56s)]
*  Mahomes 40 plus rush yards is plus one 80. I like that one because if I'm betting on his rush over, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=734.4799999999999s)]
*  I might as well just go for it and think he's going to go like eight for 45, whatever. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=741.52s)]
*  Eagles first half, Eagles to win the first half, chiefs to win the game plus seven 50. This is the [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=748.16s)]
*  cousin South special. You could see it happening. So we're putting 25 K on it. I think this is going [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=753.28s)]
*  to be a tight game. I don't think the chiefs run away with this by any means that I could [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=759.28s)]
*  totally see the Eagles winning in the first half. So we'll fly around that. And last but not least, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=762.48s)]
*  going back to the manifesto, no Barkley touchdown is plus one 50. And at Fandel, they were saying, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=766.64s)]
*  I heard through the grapevine, this is the least bet Superbowl prop. So you want to have the prop [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=774.88s)]
*  that everyone has been in the other side on plus one 50. We're putting 25 K on that. And those are [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=780.0s)]
*  the million dollar picks Superbowl edition. Don't forget Sunday night, me and cousin Sal, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=788.0799999999999s)]
*  at some point after the Superbowl ends, we will be going full tilt on everything that happened [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=794.0799999999999s)]
*  in the game. We're not going live on YouTube, but it will be on this podcast. We get the video up [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=799.68s)]
*  as fast as possible on YouTube. So there you go. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=803.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LyFPenCXI&t=817.28s)]
