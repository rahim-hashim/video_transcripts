# Will Anyone Stop the Eagles in the NFC East? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM)
*  Alright, Sal, we're coming out of the gate with your favorite division. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=0.0s)]
*  The division that has tormented you, brought you great delight. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=3.36s)]
*  Could have brought you a little more joy, I think, over the years than it did, maybe. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  A little more. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=11.68s)]
*  A decent amount of joy, but maybe a little more over the years. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=12.92s)]
*  Philadelphia is the favorite. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=16.04s)]
*  They're over under 11.5, plus 104, so there's been a little action on the under. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=18.16s)]
*  They are minus 115 to win the division, plus 330 for the conference and plus 800 for the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=23.12s)]
*  Super Bowl. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=28.6s)]
*  30 for the number one seed. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=29.76s)]
*  And if you think they can go 14 and 3, that's plus 420. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=32.0s)]
*  Who thinks that? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=34.84s)]
*  Well, they went 14 and 3 last year. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=35.84s)]
*  They're absolutely loaded. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=39.0s)]
*  I did my player rankings and they had 13 guys, plus an above average coach. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=40.0s)]
*  I said this on a previous pod. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=47.84s)]
*  I think Kurtz is my favorite MVP pick. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=49.2s)]
*  He's either 12 to 1 or 11 to 1, wherever you get it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  If you look at his stats last year where they didn't play a bunch of fourth quarters, he [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=54.28s)]
*  missed two games and he was still almost like a 3800-800 guy. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=58.32s)]
*  He's the rushing guy in the goal line. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=61.92s)]
*  He's basically Josh Allen with less PR. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=63.8s)]
*  He's the guy that gets pushed. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=65.6s)]
*  He gets pushed in. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=66.6s)]
*  He has the best offensive line in the league and up there with best weapons. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=67.6s)]
*  Running back is probably the weakest spot of the team, but even then that's the easiest [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=73.76s)]
*  spot to fill. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=76.64s)]
*  I don't want to go backwards because we did the AFC already, but yes, Hertz is a good [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=77.64s)]
*  pick, but I still say just keep betting my homes every year. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=81.08s)]
*  Just take them every year. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=84.52s)]
*  Just do it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=85.52s)]
*  We talk about that all the time. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=86.52s)]
*  6 to 1 on the Chief, 6 to 1 on the MVP, my homes. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=87.72s)]
*  Instead of a what is it annuity? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=91.47999999999999s)]
*  What is that fun that people have that we don't squander all their money gambling? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=93.24s)]
*  Just do that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=97.16s)]
*  It's definitely not called the annuity for this. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=98.16s)]
*  What are the my home's MVP odds right now? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  I thought it was six, right? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=103.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  Then by week two all of a sudden it's like plus 130. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=106.19999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=108.6s)]
*  You know that's going down. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=109.6s)]
*  It immediately changes. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=110.6s)]
*  But Hertz is a good number too, I think. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=111.6s)]
*  My homes is on Fandl right now. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=113.84s)]
*  It's 6 to 1. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=115.84s)]
*  Allen's 7 to 1, Burrow's 7 to 1, Herbert's 9 to 1. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=116.84s)]
*  Then Hertz is 12 to 1 as we're taping this earlier before the season. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  But I don't know why he doesn't see mods as anybody else. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  What is the case against this team other than schedule and Super Bowl hangover? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=128.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=133.8s)]
*  There's a few. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=134.8s)]
*  First of all, if they went under, we're looking at their under 11 and a half. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=135.8s)]
*  If they went under 11 and six is very good for a team that lost in the Super Bowl. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=139.04s)]
*  Super Bowl loser hangover is a real thing. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=144.88s)]
*  Almost always lets down. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=147.12s)]
*  Didn't happen in Cincinnati last year. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=148.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=150.52s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=151.52s)]
*  Kyle, take that out. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=152.52s)]
*  No, no. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=153.52s)]
*  But it was one of the few times where it actually didn't happen. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=154.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=158.12s)]
*  I know. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=159.12s)]
*  That's what I mentioned. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=160.12s)]
*  But no back to back winners in the NFC East in 19 years. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=161.12s)]
*  They lose both coordinators and their stats wise, it's almost impossible to duplicate [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=163.68s)]
*  what they did. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=169.24s)]
*  Even defensively what they did. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=170.24s)]
*  They were having these sacks last year and the next best was 55 and they lose a couple [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=171.96s)]
*  of those guys. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=176.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=177.84s)]
*  I know it's all about Jalen Hurts and this time last year we were probably debating whether [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=178.84s)]
*  or not he's the right fit for Philly. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=182.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=184.76s)]
*  Or did you have them going far? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=185.76s)]
*  No, we talked about that was the big question mark with them last year was what do we get [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=186.76s)]
*  with Jalen Hurts? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=191.76s)]
*  What do we get with this coach? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=192.76s)]
*  Those were the two things and both of them turned out really well. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=193.76s)]
*  I think the Jalen Carter piece, as you know I love the preseason stuff with the hype. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=196.84s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=203.04s)]
*  When the teammates start talking about guys. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=204.04s)]
*  Darius Slay had this paragraph long rave about Jalen Carter. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=206.88s)]
*  He was calling him baby rhino. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=211.28s)]
*  He was like this guy is absolutely a problem. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=212.72s)]
*  But he just did it in a way where you're like oh this guy must be really good because this [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  is like a monologue about how amazing this guy is. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=219.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=222.36s)]
*  I got the number one pick in the draft who fell to nine because there was an incident [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=223.88000000000002s)]
*  in classic NFL fashion and he just kept dropping and then in classic NFL fashion you get to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=229.44000000000003s)]
*  a point where it's like all right this is too far somebody's got to take them. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=234.72000000000003s)]
*  So they end up with them and it's a huge X factor. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  I don't feel like this is a normal Super Bowl hangover team where you're just basically [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=241.0s)]
*  adding the best guy in the draft. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=245.08s)]
*  Then if Nolan Smith's good too. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=246.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=248.12s)]
*  Well they lost seven starters. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=249.12s)]
*  Let's not forget that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=250.36s)]
*  That is tough. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=251.48000000000002s)]
*  Both coordinators but this Philly Bulldogs thing they're doing is really not. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=252.6s)]
*  So now it's the Vontae's Deontay Swift Carter Nolan Smith Jordan Davis. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=256.08s)]
*  The Kobe Dean. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=261.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=262.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=263.2s)]
*  It's really. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=264.2s)]
*  And is that the secret. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=265.2s)]
*  Like why even hire scouts like quarterbacks. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=266.2s)]
*  Another thing. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=267.52s)]
*  Take the kid from. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=268.52s)]
*  I'll check you in Alabama. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=269.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=270.52s)]
*  Just take interior lineman and interior defensive players who have started for two years for [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=271.52s)]
*  the Alabamas for the Georges. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=276.12s)]
*  And you really probably can't go wrong. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=278.24s)]
*  So they're doing that right. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=280.06s)]
*  GM is a genius but I still think 11 and 6 is a good good measure for a team you know [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=281.72s)]
*  with so much going on in a division with three playoff teams and tough first place schedule [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=287.8s)]
*  right. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=292.52000000000004s)]
*  Minnesota at Tampa Bay not that great and at Kansas City third toughest schedule in [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=293.52000000000004s)]
*  the league. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=297.36s)]
*  I think their offense is going to be incredible. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=298.76000000000005s)]
*  But they do have the best offensive line. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=301.20000000000005s)]
*  They do probably have the best one to receiver punch unless you wanted to throw the sense [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=304.20000000000005s)]
*  you guys at me. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=308.16s)]
*  Smith and Brown probably have the championship both for that. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=310.4s)]
*  Goddard's the best all around tight end. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=314.24s)]
*  Hertz is no worse than the fifth QB in the league. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=316.8s)]
*  So you could say I don't have the same offensive coordinator. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=320.28s)]
*  Maybe that's going to hurt them. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=323.0s)]
*  But I just think they're so loaded on offense. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=324.0s)]
*  And could the recipe be what happened last year where they just get these leads. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=326.64s)]
*  The best thing they have is the pass rush. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=330.71999999999997s)]
*  So now that now they're up 14 in the fourth quarter those guys are just like you know [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=332.44s)]
*  killing whoever and they're finished. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=336.4s)]
*  I can't argue. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=337.71999999999997s)]
*  I can't say they got lucky last year. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=338.8s)]
*  They blew everybody out. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=340.12s)]
*  They were a tour de force. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=341.64000000000004s)]
*  So you have them at 13. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=343.32000000000005s)]
*  So I have them at 12 and five and I'd be willing to consider 13 which 13 plus wins on Fandals [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  plus 210. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=351.44000000000005s)]
*  But I think 12 and five with the schedule they're catching New England really nicely [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=352.44000000000005s)]
*  in that week one where New England's offensive line. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=358.08000000000004s)]
*  I still don't even know who's starting. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=360.20000000000005s)]
*  It gets a little dicey at the end. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=362.8s)]
*  One of the interesting things and this ties in with the Giants over under too. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=364.92s)]
*  They play the Giants week 16 and then week 18. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=368.12s)]
*  And they might have everything wrapped up because it's either them, Dallas or San Francisco. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=371.2s)]
*  We agree those are the three teams. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=375.48s)]
*  I don't see anybody else unless the Packers just catch this crazy schedule wind and all [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=377.64000000000004s)]
*  of a sudden they're 10 and 1. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=382.24s)]
*  Those are the three favorites. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=383.56s)]
*  But I think those are the three. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=384.84000000000003s)]
*  And there's a chance Philly if anything happens to the other two that Philly just has this [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=386.40000000000003s)]
*  locked up down the stretch which would help the Giants. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=390.48s)]
*  I just don't see any world where they're worse than 12 and five unless somebody gets hurt. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=393.56s)]
*  I think somebody has to get hurt. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=400.24s)]
*  But their over under is 11. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=401.78000000000003s)]
*  I know. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=403.16s)]
*  I just think they're a 12-win team. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=404.16s)]
*  They have too much talent. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=405.16s)]
*  And I'll say this with your team. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=406.72s)]
*  Your team the over under is nine and a half and it stayed that way and it's got a huge [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=408.6s)]
*  minus sign on it now. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=412.48s)]
*  It's like minus 165. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=413.8s)]
*  That's stupid. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=414.8s)]
*  I don't know why your over under is not 10 and a half. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=415.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=418.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=419.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=420.48s)]
*  So let's move to your team and we can compare and contrast. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=421.48s)]
*  Well first of all real quick because I will throw an Eagles prop at you which is good [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=422.96000000000004s)]
*  on Fandl. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=426.96000000000004s)]
*  Jalen Carter or Nolan Smith defensive rookie of the year plus 550. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=427.96000000000004s)]
*  That's pretty good. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=431.68s)]
*  Two bites of the apple there. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=432.68s)]
*  That's pretty good. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=434.48s)]
*  Or the cheesesteak however you want to do it. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=435.48s)]
*  But my team yeah nine and a half it won't move. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=436.48s)]
*  Would you say it was minus 162 is the over. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=439.40000000000003s)]
*  They must. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=441.68s)]
*  I think when there's so much money on it they almost become afraid to move it because then [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=442.68s)]
*  you can just try to middle it and get it at 10. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=447.0s)]
*  The other way. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=449.0s)]
*  I've seen a couple of them move. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=450.0s)]
*  I thought the Ravens moved the actual number. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=451.0s)]
*  I think that's too low. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=452.52s)]
*  Your defense is going to be awesome. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=453.52s)]
*  Listen. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=454.52s)]
*  Like the fact that you added Gilmore. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=455.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=456.52s)]
*  I thought it was one of the most under the radar things. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=457.52s)]
*  He was awesome last year. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=458.52s)]
*  He was like 2019 Pat Gilmore last year. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=459.52s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=460.52s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=461.52s)]
*  Gilmore they pick up cooks. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=462.52s)]
*  I mean they're probably going to have the best set of corners with Diggs Gilmore. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=463.52s)]
*  This guy bland in the slot. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=466.52s)]
*  But Kellen Moore out. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=467.52s)]
*  That's what worries me a little. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=468.52s)]
*  Mike McCarthy announcing he's calling the plays. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=469.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=470.52s)]
*  They're going to run a lot more. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=471.52s)]
*  Yeah that's where he's. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=472.52s)]
*  What are we going to run to the left. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=473.52s)]
*  I mean he's giving away a lot of money. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=474.52s)]
*  He's giving away a lot of money. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=475.52s)]
*  He's giving away a lot of money. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=476.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=478.03999999999996s)]
*  Everybody know you're lined up on the wrong side defense. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=479.03999999999996s)]
*  Listen. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=480.03999999999996s)]
*  We were damn good last year. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=481.03999999999996s)]
*  I know. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=482.03999999999996s)]
*  It's comical once we get to the playoffs. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=483.03999999999996s)]
*  12 wins. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=484.03999999999996s)]
*  We knock out Brady. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=485.03999999999996s)]
*  We forced him to retire. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=486.03999999999996s)]
*  The guy was never going to retire if we hadn't beaten them in the playoff game and they lost [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=487.03999999999996s)]
*  to an excellent 49er squad. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=488.2s)]
*  So. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=489.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=490.2s)]
*  Talking about them as a regular season team is different than talking about the guys on [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=491.2s)]
*  the left. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=492.2s)]
*  You know, I mean I'm not going to say they're going to be a great team. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=493.2s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=494.2s)]
*  I think you're going to see them. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=495.2s)]
*  I think you're going to see them. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=496.2s)]
*  I think you're going to see them. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=497.2s)]
*  I think you're going to see them. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=498.2s)]
*  I think you're going to see them. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=499.2s)]
*  And they lost to an excellent 49er squad. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=501.2s)]
*  So okay. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=503.4s)]
*  Talking about them as a regular season team is different than talking about what's going [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=504.84s)]
*  to happen in mid-January. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=508.03999999999996s)]
*  But I do like them over nine and a half. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=509.92s)]
*  Well, you also you're the best defensive player in the league. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=511.56s)]
*  I think Parsons has the belt now. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=514.04s)]
*  Unless you want to give it to Chris Jones because Lombardi has the whole thing. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=516.88s)]
*  He thought Chris Jones was the best guy last year. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=520.6s)]
*  Really? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=523.12s)]
*  It's either. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=524.12s)]
*  It was either him or Parsons. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=525.2s)]
*  Donald who I think everybody thought was the best guy with that team. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=526.4s)]
*  So young. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=530.28s)]
*  13 and a half sacks. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=531.28s)]
*  You know, they lock up digs for $97 million. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=532.28s)]
*  He has 17 interceptions in the first three years. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=534.8s)]
*  They have some real ballers on defense. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=537.48s)]
*  Parsons defensive player of the year is like plus 450. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=540.0s)]
*  I don't know why he just wouldn't be in the mix every year. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=542.0s)]
*  Because he just destroys games. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=545.1999999999999s)]
*  We're never seeing LT again. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=547.6s)]
*  But things could open up for him too. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=549.6s)]
*  It's a semi LT-ish impact. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=550.6s)]
*  And you just have a shitload of talent. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=553.4s)]
*  Schedule you play an AFC East NFC West. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=557.0s)]
*  So you have two easy NFC West games. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=559.7s)]
*  And then who knows maybe someone will see stinking the AFC East. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=561.9s)]
*  But to me 11 and 6 minimum. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=564.72s)]
*  And you're gonna have games where the defense just wins the game and you don't even have [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=568.72s)]
*  to do anything. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=571.6s)]
*  It has nothing to do with the playoffs. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=572.6s)]
*  You know, it's like what we said about the Bills. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=574.22s)]
*  Like you can be a really good regular season team. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=576.2s)]
*  It might not mean anything. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=578.24s)]
*  But I don't see how you're not one of the best three teams. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=580.2s)]
*  I would have loved to have zagged against it. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=582.08s)]
*  Especially with McCarthy. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=584.2s)]
*  Like give me the car keys. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=585.2s)]
*  It's McCarthy time. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=586.8000000000001s)]
*  I don't trust Dak as you know. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=588.2s)]
*  I thought Dak was not good last year. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=589.44s)]
*  Do you not think he's a top eight quarterback? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=591.2s)]
*  You wouldn't put him in your top eight? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=593.48s)]
*  No. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=594.96s)]
*  Really? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=595.96s)]
*  No. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=596.96s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=597.96s)]
*  Look at his numbers. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=598.96s)]
*  Like last year was just a weird year. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=599.96s)]
*  I'll tell you where I had him. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=601.76s)]
*  So I have Mahomes. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=603.5200000000001s)]
*  I might throw this water in your face. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=604.5200000000001s)]
*  Mahomes. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=607.9200000000001s)]
*  Then I have eight pointers. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=609.2s)]
*  Allen, Herbert, Hertz, Burrow. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=610.6s)]
*  Six pointers. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=613.08s)]
*  Rogers, Lamar, and Lawrence. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=614.08s)]
*  So is that, that's eight. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=616.88s)]
*  I don't know what these are. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=618.36s)]
*  So I have Prescott at nine. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=619.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=620.36s)]
*  Oh you have nine. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=621.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=622.36s)]
*  That's better than most. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=623.36s)]
*  And then I have like Cousins, Watson, Jones, Gino, Stafford right after him. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=624.36s)]
*  Listen, he said he wasn't going to have ten interceptions. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=628.44s)]
*  He called it out. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=631.72s)]
*  He called the number. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=632.72s)]
*  And so far he's right. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=633.72s)]
*  He only has like eight interceptions in preseason practices. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=634.72s)]
*  So good for him. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=637.96s)]
*  No. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=639.72s)]
*  PF Focus had him second in standard accuracy. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=640.72s)]
*  It's so weird how people view Dak Prescott, but I think he's going to be the guy. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=642.32s)]
*  I'm glad we haven't mentioned Trey Lance. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=646.76s)]
*  People losing their minds over Trey Lance. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=648.84s)]
*  A guy who's going to be inconsequential on this roster. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=650.44s)]
*  I don't understand who were you competing against with the fourth round pick for Trey [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=654.0s)]
*  Lance? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=657.48s)]
*  Who were the other teams lining up? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=658.48s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=659.48s)]
*  Oh. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=660.48s)]
*  Why did you have to give up anything for him? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=661.48s)]
*  I thought the Niners were going to have to trade a pick to get rid of him because he [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=662.48s)]
*  had like this guaranteed money. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=666.4000000000001s)]
*  It's like picking up a piano. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=667.8000000000001s)]
*  Like no, no, you're not going to get money for this piano. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=669.32s)]
*  I got to take it out of your house. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=671.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=672.48s)]
*  And I have to like pay the movers to take the piano. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=673.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=675.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=676.48s)]
*  No, no, actually, I'm going to also need a fourth round pick with the piano. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=677.48s)]
*  He's a piano man. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=679.2s)]
*  I'm doing you a favor. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=680.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=681.2s)]
*  I don't. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=682.2s)]
*  If you had to add, we talked about this on Against All Odds. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=683.2s)]
*  How many over under touchdown runs for Lance though? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=684.84s)]
*  He might be the push E, which the Eagles make famous. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=688.0s)]
*  Oh, you think they're going to use him in packages like Malik Cunningham? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=690.84s)]
*  Because I don't think maybe just like at the one yard line. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=693.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=695.88s)]
*  I think he's a practice squad hero. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=696.88s)]
*  But yeah, I don't know. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=698.28s)]
*  I could see them using him in that regard. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=699.6s)]
*  But again, I thought Cooper Rush was solid. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=702.36s)]
*  We know he can win. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=704.88s)]
*  He went four and one last year. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=705.88s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=707.4s)]
*  These two teams are really good. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=709.4s)]
*  I think with Dallas, there is a sneaky at the Giants week one game. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=711.28s)]
*  Sure. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=718.32s)]
*  Followed by the Jets week two in Dallas. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=719.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=722.08s)]
*  New York back to back. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=723.08s)]
*  Like 0 and 2. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=724.2800000000001s)]
*  Not even on your radar? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=728.2s)]
*  No, sure it is. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=729.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=730.2s)]
*  Those are tough teams. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=731.2s)]
*  But we do have the Giants number for sure. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=732.2s)]
*  I'll throw this at you. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=733.5600000000001s)]
*  Cowboys highest scoring team is 16 to 1. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=734.5600000000001s)]
*  I think we're only like only a few points off that measure. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=736.84s)]
*  Like I said, Dak missed for four games there, five games. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=740.24s)]
*  I was excited for your number one seed bet, but I didn't like the odds. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=744.48s)]
*  It was plus 600. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=747.6800000000001s)]
*  What was it? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=748.6800000000001s)]
*  Six? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=749.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=750.6800000000001s)]
*  I thought maybe if it was like nine to one, I thought that would be tasty. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=751.6800000000001s)]
*  Playoffs minus 225 seems pretty fair. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=754.28s)]
*  Super Bowl 13 to 1, but you can't. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=759.52s)]
*  Dallas Super Bowl odds are always screwed up. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=761.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, because you're like Red Sox fans. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=763.1999999999999s)]
*  People just bet it. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=765.3599999999999s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=766.3599999999999s)]
*  We can talk regular season. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=767.3599999999999s)]
*  I can't get them postseason just yet. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=768.3599999999999s)]
*  Do you want to power rank your top five most disappointing Dallas seasons before we move [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=770.68s)]
*  on? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=775.0s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=776.0s)]
*  You don't want to do that off the top of your head? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=777.0s)]
*  Why would I have to do that? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=778.0s)]
*  What was the number one most disappointing Dallas season? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=779.0s)]
*  Romo Bach and the Snap? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=782.48s)]
*  No, when they lost to the Giants and they were 13-3 that year, and Eli and Giants won [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=784.76s)]
*  the Super Bowl and beat your team. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=791.28s)]
*  It's probably the same year as yours, right? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=793.12s)]
*  You had that year. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=795.6s)]
*  What about the year when Dak didn't get up to the line in time to run the last play? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=796.6s)]
*  Yeah, that was fun. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=800.6s)]
*  Who were you playing in that year? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=801.6s)]
*  The Niners. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=802.6s)]
*  And then the Niners last year was when Zekio Elliott snapped the ball and got shellacked. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=803.6s)]
*  And got annihilated. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=809.68s)]
*  Last play as a cowboy. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=811.28s)]
*  I want to make fun of Jerry Jones more, but they drafted really well. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=813.56s)]
*  They've made a lot of smart moves. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=817.12s)]
*  It's hard to say. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=819.0s)]
*  You look at some of these other teams like the Cardinals who don't have anyone left on [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=820.0s)]
*  their team and some other dreading, even the 49ers, bad drafts. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=822.56s)]
*  They traded up to get Parsons. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=827.64s)]
*  They didn't fall to their lap. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=828.64s)]
*  They made moves and they went and they got them. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=830.28s)]
*  It's impressive. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=832.28s)]
*  All right, so here's what's going to get a little wonky. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=833.28s)]
*  I also have the Giants in double figures going 10 and 7 and making the playoffs. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=837.12s)]
*  They're over under 7 and a half. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=842.92s)]
*  They are plus 172 to make the playoffs. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=846.0s)]
*  I bet I've already made. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=848.88s)]
*  They are 3 to 1 to win 10 plus games. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=849.88s)]
*  And here's the case. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=855.2s)]
*  I'm not scared off that they're in the Dallas Philly division. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=857.16s)]
*  All right, so they go 1 and 3 against those teams. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=859.5600000000001s)]
*  The Giants are good. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=862.04s)]
*  They were 9-7-1 last year. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=863.04s)]
*  They were slapping things together. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=865.88s)]
*  It was supposed to be this rebuilding year and Dayball did such a good job rejuvenating [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=867.56s)]
*  everybody that by the end of the year they actually had something. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=871.64s)]
*  They win a playoff game. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=875.16s)]
*  I thought Tibbido came on. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=876.84s)]
*  I liked the draft that they had. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=878.76s)]
*  The Darren Waller thing is a real thing. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=881.12s)]
*  I think they're going to unleash that guy. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=883.24s)]
*  I try not to get too sucked in by the preseason hype, but that guy was awesome three years ago. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=885.12s)]
*  Oh, all right. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=890.48s)]
*  And he was supposed to have a huge comeback year last year. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=891.48s)]
*  There's something weird with his salary. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=893.96s)]
*  Do you know how many, guess how many, mis-tackles he forced last year, Darren Waller? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=895.76s)]
*  Not a lot. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=900.4s)]
*  Just guess. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=901.4s)]
*  Guess zero, you'll be right. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=902.4s)]
*  You want to be right? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=903.4s)]
*  Guess zero. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=904.4s)]
*  Not one. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=905.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=906.4s)]
*  I think the little weirdness with this team, the Barkley offseason fiasco is not great. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=907.4s)]
*  I liked them this time last year. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=911.56s)]
*  I don't know if I picked them to make the playoffs. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=912.9599999999999s)]
*  I liked them over. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=914.36s)]
*  I think they're 7 and 10. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=915.72s)]
*  The Dayball thing is we're going to look back at that. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=917.04s)]
*  Like, he won Coach of the Year at 9-7-1. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=919.0s)]
*  I don't know if we're going to see that again. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=922.8399999999999s)]
*  And they were 1-4-1 in the division game. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=925.12s)]
*  So if you think they're going to improve on that, I could see why you might go over 7 [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=927.4s)]
*  and a half. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=931.84s)]
*  It's just such a suspicious, it's the most suspicious line I think over on their out [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=932.84s)]
*  there, 7 and a half. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=936.68s)]
*  Well, there's some terrible rest stuff with them. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=937.68s)]
*  They have a hard schedule. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=940.12s)]
*  I get all the reasons. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=941.84s)]
*  They're doing AFC East, NFC West. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=942.84s)]
*  One of the things I like for the over, they play Philly in week 18. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=946.16s)]
*  16 and 18. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=950.12s)]
*  You said, oh yeah, right. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=951.12s)]
*  But that has all the makings of Philly doesn't play anybody. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=952.92s)]
*  So they can, even for the over-under, which is 7 and a half. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=956.0799999999999s)]
*  Let's say there's 7 and 9 heading into that last week and Philly arrests everybody. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=959.4399999999999s)]
*  That could get them to 8. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=963.3199999999999s)]
*  But does anyone sit anyone in week 18 now that it's almost always something to play [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=964.3199999999999s)]
*  for now, now that there's only one bye? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=968.68s)]
*  Even the Chiefs played all their guys against the Raiders last year. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=970.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no, it happened last year. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=974.56s)]
*  I like their pass rush. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=976.7199999999999s)]
*  I like their style. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=978.04s)]
*  And really I love their coach. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=980.1999999999999s)]
*  And I thought he was one of the best coaches I saw last year. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=981.64s)]
*  And I just find it hard to believe they're going to go 7 and 10. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=984.38s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=986.6s)]
*  I think they're, especially in this crap conference. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=987.6s)]
*  He replaced Judge. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=989.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=990.6s)]
*  That was your new coach guy last year. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=991.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=992.6s)]
*  Washington, I have under 6 and a half. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=993.6s)]
*  Oh, House is not going to be happy. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=995.88s)]
*  Plus 100. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=997.64s)]
*  Same thing. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=998.64s)]
*  They finished 8, 8 and 1 last year. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=999.64s)]
*  They're plus 310 to make the playoffs. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1004.0s)]
*  There's some weird Washington buzz that I don't fully understand because I think a lot of [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1007.08s)]
*  people watch that game when they beat Philly. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1011.4s)]
*  I think Ron Rivera is one of the five worst coaches in the league. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1014.04s)]
*  And we'll get to another coach that I can't believe people don't realize later. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1018.04s)]
*  I think people are looking at an even more recent game. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1021.36s)]
*  I hear a lot of people talk about that preseason game against the Ravens where they broke the [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1025.44s)]
*  streak as this is it. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1029.28s)]
*  This is the moment Washington turns it around. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1031.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're trying. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1033.0s)]
*  You're playing your first stringers in a preseason game. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1034.0s)]
*  By the way, they gave up five first downs in the first six plays that defense. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1036.52s)]
*  But yeah, I'm not there either. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1040.24s)]
*  I'm going under. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1042.8s)]
*  I don't. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1043.8s)]
*  First of all, great. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1044.8s)]
*  Daniel Snyder's out. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1046.24s)]
*  That stench is gone. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1047.6s)]
*  You got Josh Harris, the new owner, no more sewage in the stadium. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1048.6s)]
*  But it's still Sam Howell and Eric Miannemi trying to pick up an offense that hasn't been [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1052.1s)]
*  top 20 in six years. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1057.18s)]
*  I just don't see a lot of explosive playmakers on either side of the ball, including Chase [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1059.04s)]
*  Young, who they didn't grant that 50 year option. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1063.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1066.0s)]
*  If Chase Young was good, why didn't they grant the option? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1067.0s)]
*  There was already like that weird Rivera Miannemi thing. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1069.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1072.52s)]
*  That the season I even started it. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1073.52s)]
*  I was looking at him for first coach fired. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1074.52s)]
*  They're at Denver, at Philly, at Atlanta, at the Giants, at New England, at Seattle, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1076.56s)]
*  at Dallas and at the Jets. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1080.4799999999998s)]
*  So none of those games are easy. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1081.8s)]
*  They also have Buffalo, Philly, San Francisco and Dallas at home. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1083.2399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, six teams with six games with teams with 12 or more wins. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1086.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't see any roadmap for them to be good. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1091.9599999999998s)]
*  I have them down for six and eleven. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1094.1999999999998s)]
*  They're over under six and a half. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1095.9199999999998s)]
*  So there you go. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDcn9icsuQM&t=1096.9199999999998s)]
