# Comparing the Trey Lance Trade-up to Other Bad NFL Trades | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [August 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA)
*  I want to start with the, uh, the trade Lance trade, which really went badly for San Francisco. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=0.0s)]
*  But I was thinking about in the context of these what if trades, when a team is really close to [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  winning a title and there can be this what if moment that can either push them one direction [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=14.16s)]
*  or the other. Right. And you think like they had the 12th pick in that amazing draft and then I'm [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=19.68s)]
*  getting nothing out of it. But yet when I was doing all my rankings for the season this year, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  they have the most talent in the league. So they, they whiffed on that trade and still have the most [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=29.2s)]
*  talent in the league. What if you just cherry picked anybody else from that top 12 and put them [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=35.2s)]
*  in there? It's just, it's kind of amazing how it worked out. Right. I still think they have a chance [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=39.2s)]
*  to win the NFC. They do. I mean, look, they finally, you know, other than, you know, Kyle had, uh, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=43.36s)]
*  when he went there, he had Brian Hoyer that didn't work trades for Garoppolo that worked. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  And then, you know, CJ Beather, Nick Mullins, none of those guys work and now Purdy worked. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=53.2s)]
*  And so, yeah, I mean, they've collected this, they've done a really good job of collecting [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=58.64s)]
*  talent around their defense, the skill players getting Samuel, you know, trade for McCaffrey. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=63.92s)]
*  I mean, they've done a really good job other than they missed, they whiffed on this one. And I think [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=69.68s)]
*  they got overextended. They kept convincing themselves they had to change the offense [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=73.76s)]
*  when really in reality, McCaffrey trade changed their offense. They became positionalists on [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=79.52s)]
*  offense. Samuels are running back, Noe's a receiver. McCaffrey's a receiver, Noe's a running back. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=84.72s)]
*  That changed their offense, not Trey Lance. I think they misjudged that, but they're good enough to [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=89.92s)]
*  recover. That's a good organization that does that. Yeah. I was trying to think other teams that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  could whiff on this and still win a championship. So obviously my mind went to the NBA because [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=100.08s)]
*  that's the sport I can remember the best. The Detroit Pistons, they have that Darko pick and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=105.12s)]
*  they miss it, right? And Carmelo and Wade and Bosch are the next three picks. They could add any of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=111.12s)]
*  them and added them to the team. And they, a little bit like the Niners, got a little cute. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=116.88000000000001s)]
*  And they were thinking, well, we already have Taishan Prince. We don't need another wing guy. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=121.76s)]
*  Let's hit a home run here. Yeah, Darko, oh, his game. Oh my God, he had this amazing workout. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=127.2s)]
*  Darko and Trey Lance, there's a lot of similarities to, oh my God, this won't be a home run pick. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=132.16s)]
*  This would be a grand slam pick if we add him. And they whiff it and they still won in 0-4. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=137.11999999999998s)]
*  And then they had a really nice four year run. But then you look and you think like, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=142.32s)]
*  man, if they had gotten Carmelo, it's different. I think the biggest mistake we make in scouting is [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=145.92s)]
*  we just have this ability to project a player that there's no evidence that it's there. It's [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=151.2s)]
*  like a baseball player. We're going to go from a wooden bat, aluminum bat to a wooden bat, and he's [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  going to increase his power. That's not going to happen. We know it's going to decrease. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=161.68s)]
*  And so this Lance thing, he never played. I mean, I can still remember, we drafted Terrence Flagler [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=165.52s)]
*  in the first round in San Francisco in 1985, and he was a disaster. And after the pick, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=172.4s)]
*  and we found out about Flagler, the running back, Walsh said to me, he said, you can't take these [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=178.32s)]
*  guys that don't play and look forward. You got to take these guys that don't play and look back. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=183.84s)]
*  That was my thought on Mitchell Trebisky, one year player, Mr. Ohio in the state of Ohio, right? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=189.68s)]
*  But they don't, doesn't get recruited to go to Ohio State at quarterback. He gets recruited to [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=195.2s)]
*  play free safety. He's got to go to North Carolina where he doesn't play. Trey Lance, University of [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=199.04s)]
*  Minnesota says, we'll take you, but definitely not as a quarterback. And then he goes to North [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=203.52s)]
*  Dakota State and he plays, but is that really playing at the highest level? I think these one [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=208.48s)]
*  year sensations, whether, and where you don't see them and you're projecting them like, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=213.6s)]
*  like Darko and all those guys, you make mistakes on them and you, and you convince yourself [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=217.84s)]
*  through your own bias. Oh yeah, he's going to be good. He's going to be good. He's going to be good. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=223.04s)]
*  When there's no evidence that says he's going to be good. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=226.48s)]
*  Those workouts are tough. I mean, there's so many ways a draft can go wrong. Like even in your book, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=229.68s)]
*  you wrote about when you guys passed on Warren Sapp in 95, cause you had bad Intel about off, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=234.56s)]
*  off the field stuff with him, you know, not taking them. And he becomes one of the best 50 [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=241.2s)]
*  players of all time. Marino's another one where, you know, and that's been pretty famously chronicled. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=246.16s)]
*  So you have off field whisper stuff can be one thing. And then the flip side of that, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=251.44s)]
*  where, you know, the right workout and you see somebody, I remember Yi Zhen Lan, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  that would, they're in the Durant-Oden draft. Yi Zhen Lan like posting up the chairs and being [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  like, Oh, look at this guy. It's like, can we see this guy play basketball? And these scouts can [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  just fall in love with the idea of something versus what the evidence actually is. Right. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=270.96s)]
*  Right. Well, you know, I'm, you know, the life of a sixer fan. Oh, Sean Bradley, we see, you know, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=275.44s)]
*  and I know he's hurt right now. I mean, unfortunately, but he's going to be great. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=280.32s)]
*  Okay. Markel Foltz. I mean, literally he came in and worked out and they said it was a horrendous [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=284.79999999999995s)]
*  workout, but we're going to overlook that and pick them first overall in the draft. I mean, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=289.35999999999996s)]
*  sometimes our bias just gets in the way of it. I wish I could live my life again [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=293.12s)]
*  and remind myself in the draft room, you have bias, you have bias, you have bias. You're making [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=297.44s)]
*  a mistake. You're screwing this thing up because you want it to be this way and it's not. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=301.84s)]
*  I think that what made that Trey Lance, there's been a lot of bad football trades over the years, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=306.96s)]
*  right? Even when you think of what Denver actually traded for John Elway, who everybody knew was [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=311.6s)]
*  like a potential generational quarterback. And they gave up Chris Hinton, another first, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=317.52s)]
*  you look back and it's like 20 cents on the dollar for this guy who becomes this amazing guy. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  But I think the thing that was really weird about the Trey Lance thing, and I never understood it, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=328.79999999999995s)]
*  I remember talking about it on time on my podcast, you certainly talked about it on yours, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=333.11999999999995s)]
*  is they traded up not knowing what they were going to do. I don't remember that situation [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=337.44s)]
*  before. Like even when the Bears traded up for Trubisky and they didn't trade up that much, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=342.32s)]
*  they moved up one spot, they gave up a third and some other stuff. But what was more galling about [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=346.32s)]
*  that was that Mahomes and Watson were in that draft and they just completely miscalculated it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=351.04s)]
*  This Niners thing was so different because it was such a great draft. There was a real chance [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=355.28000000000003s)]
*  somebody might fall down to them anyway. And when you move up like that, you kind of have to know [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=361.04s)]
*  what you're doing. And it didn't seem like they did. And you've talked a lot about on your part [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=365.92s)]
*  about you felt like Shanahan wanted Mack Jones. And then they spent the next couple months [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=369.44s)]
*  basically convincing him that Trey Lance was the guy. But how do you trade up to a spot and give [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=374.8s)]
*  up all that capital and not know what you're going to do? Well, see, I think they did. I think he was [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=379.44s)]
*  in Cabo. He watched Mack Jones. He felt like, oh, this guy, the Patriots are going to pick this guy. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=384.4s)]
*  We got to get in front of the Patriots to get them. They already were in front of the Patriots at 12, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=390.32s)]
*  but he felt they were going to trade up. And I think his front office, Adam Peters, John Lynch [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=394.8s)]
*  said, no, no, no, no. And it was all over Twitter. You can't trade up for Mack Jones. He's not athletic [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=399.84s)]
*  enough. He's not good enough. Trey Lance, you have to trade up for. That's who you have to [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=405.12s)]
*  trade up for. And look, I think this will go down. There's probably going to be a whole COVID-19 [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=409.12s)]
*  mistake world that we all lived in. Right. You know, this was, you didn't, nobody was on the road. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=415.36s)]
*  Nobody saw them. I mean, the high school rankings in COVID-19 were all messed up too. The colleges [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=420.48s)]
*  that got high rankings on their. You're talking 2020, not 19. Right. Yeah. 2020 COVID-19, I called it, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=427.04s)]
*  you know, whatever that is. But so they, they just, I think they just miscalculated and they [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=433.36s)]
*  convinced them. So I can't remember. I sent Kyle a text and I said, look, let me tell you a story. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=438.32s)]
*  You know, in 1986, we're getting ready to trade for Steve Young and he, Bill Walsh walked in the room [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=443.68s)]
*  and asked everybody in the room, Mike Holmgren, everybody, Bob McKittrick, Ray Rhodes, Bill [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=451.28s)]
*  McPherson, George Seifert, all these legendary coaches, would you trade for, for Steve Young? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=455.52s)]
*  And not a hand went up. Now, a lot of them were partial to Joe Montana, right? They, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=461.52s)]
*  they wanted Joe, right? And Bill walks out of the room and he says to me, go pick up Steve Young at [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=465.92s)]
*  the airport. I'm not listening to them. Sometimes you got to do what you believe is the right thing [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=470.56s)]
*  to do. And you're the only one who knows the right thing to do. You know, I say this all the time, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=475.04s)]
*  they've never dedicated a monument to a committee. When you have, when you're asking a lot of people's [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=479.84000000000003s)]
*  opinions, you're going to end up diluting your opinion and you're going to make a bad decision. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=484.24s)]
*  I'm not saying Kyle's got all the answers, but when it comes to the quarterback position, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=488.32s)]
*  he knows. And I think he let them stuff that he took the heat for it. He stood in front of him and [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=492.32s)]
*  say, look, it's on me. I get that. But under behind the scenes, Christopher Sims and I both knew what [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=496.48s)]
*  was going on there. And we both were saying it. Now we were getting killed on Twitter, certainly. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=502.48s)]
*  But I think that's what happened. And I think it's another lesson for any decision-maker out there. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=506.56s)]
*  You got to really limit the amount of people you evaluate the evaluators. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=511.76s)]
*  I think sports and television work very similarly in that respect. Because you think like the great [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=515.44s)]
*  shows, right? David Chase. Yeah. Your favorite show, The Sopranos, one of my top three. You're, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=523.2800000000001s)]
*  I mean, you're like, you're almost psychotic with The Sopranos. You can compare any situation to [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=529.2s)]
*  The Sopranos episode. I don't know how you do it. It's really amazing. But David Chase wasn't [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=535.2800000000001s)]
*  coming up with like the season three season finale is like, let me, let me pull my group of nine HBO [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=541.44s)]
*  executives and 11 people in the writer's room and try to decide what I'm going to do with these [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=548.24s)]
*  three storylines. Like ultimately like kids his vision he's doing it. He had like one or two people [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=553.2s)]
*  that he bounced stuff off. That's it. And in sports, that seems like the most successful model. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=558.0s)]
*  The more that people come in and, oh, the owner's got some ideas. Oh, the owner's got a son. He [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=563.6800000000001s)]
*  wants to get into player personnel stuff. So now these two are in the head coach is in, oh, wait, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=568.56s)]
*  the defensive coordinator has to be involved. He's he his buddy coached this guy in college and now [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=573.4399999999999s)]
*  he got nine people in there and that's where it falls apart. Right? Right. Yeah. I mean, Orson Welles [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=578.4s)]
*  talked about this. They asked him, how did he get so much authority to make Citizen Kane? Because he, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=584.16s)]
*  when he made Citizen Kane, he didn't have to show the dailies to the executives. He didn't have to [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=589.52s)]
*  get approval. He got all the authority to make Citizen Kane without any any interruption from [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=594.24s)]
*  RK Studios. And the reason he got is he kept saying no to him. I don't want to do it. And they kept [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=599.8399999999999s)]
*  pressuring him. And when he finally made it, they had to accept what he made. And I think there's a [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=604.3199999999999s)]
*  lot to that. Like you get too many people interjecting their opinions. It all of a sudden [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=609.52s)]
*  that you because there's doubt that builds in there. And so he was able to make a movie that's [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=614.8s)]
*  maybe the greatest movie of all time. I don't know. Right. So it's in the top 20. And because [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=619.92s)]
*  he was able to get away, it's the same thing with trades. When you can just focus on, I don't think [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=625.4399999999999s)]
*  Pat Riley or Jerry West with a great NBA general managers. I don't think they listen to very many [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=630.3199999999999s)]
*  people. I think they make their decisions based on their instincts, having played the game, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=636.0799999999999s)]
*  having been a part of it and understanding it. So when you were in Cleveland, how many people [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=641.04s)]
*  with the Belichick era, how many people are in that room? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=646.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, there were a lot. We had the Modell family. Art Modell would always listen to the newspapers. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=649.76s)]
*  That day of the SAP draft, he wanted to draft Tyrone Wheatley because the barber told him [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=656.56s)]
*  Wheatley was going to be a great player. George the barber. I love George the barber. He was great. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=660.56s)]
*  He's an Italian guy. I made sure that I always talked to George. But we screwed that up. I [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=666.0799999999999s)]
*  screwed that up because we didn't have enough data on SAP. We were told it was going to go bad. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=671.36s)]
*  It was wrong. Now, maybe we got lied to. Maybe we got conned because three picks later he goes. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=676.96s)]
*  We had a great opportunity to make that draft still work. We were sitting there between [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=683.36s)]
*  Curtis Martin and another player and Craig Powell. We just said, okay, we'll get them later. Of course, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=688.0s)]
*  we didn't get them. That's all on us. But what happens is when you get too many people saying [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=696.56s)]
*  this is what you have to do, all of a sudden you don't have the conviction that you need. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=701.68s)]
*  Not to compare 30 for 30 to Citizen Kane, but after I came up with the idea and I started [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=707.4399999999999s)]
*  developing it with Connor Shell, nobody at ESPN thought it was going to happen. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=712.4s)]
*  We got left alone for basically a year. We developed the whole thing and then talked to [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=717.4399999999999s)]
*  all these people and nobody blocked us or got involved or anything because [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=723.12s)]
*  it just was assumed it was going to get killed and never happened. By the time we finally had [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=728.32s)]
*  the meeting where we had to pitch it to everybody, we had every single piece figured out and there [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=732.72s)]
*  was no way for anyone to mess with it. I always felt like if there had been a couple people [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=737.6s)]
*  at any point in that first nine months, it probably goes a different way and things get screwed up. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=742.4s)]
*  You know, I always feel like for something really cool to happen a lot of times, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=747.92s)]
*  the least amount of people that can be involved, it's usually the way to go. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=752.9599999999999s)]
*  Sports trades, I think you made a great point with the COVID year. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=757.28s)]
*  Because a lot of people have compared trade lands to Wiseman and you go back and you look at that [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=761.6s)]
*  2020 NBA draft. Wiseman goes second, Keeley and Hayes go seventh, Halliburton falls all the way [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=767.52s)]
*  to twelfth, it was like lights out, but there's no tournament that year. Desmond Bain falls, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=773.44s)]
*  I think thirtieth and all these things happen that just because we didn't have a tournament [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=778.32s)]
*  to kind of watch these guys at the highest possible competition level and then they weren't [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=782.5600000000001s)]
*  able to work them out in person. So then crazy shit happens. So do you think there had to be a [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=787.2s)]
*  little piece of that with NFL? Right. And there was too much information. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=791.6800000000001s)]
*  Everybody was talking to everybody because you had to call somebody on the phone to get details [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=795.12s)]
*  because you weren't going to see the player, right? Oh, let me call my buddy over here and [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=799.0400000000001s)]
*  talk about Desmond Bain. Let me talk about this player. Let me talk about all of a sudden, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=802.8s)]
*  you've got too many people. I think the key line in any business, whether it's making 30, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=806.64s)]
*  is evaluate the evaluator. Who's giving you the information? That's the key is like, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=812.56s)]
*  we don't evaluate, it's like pro football focus. They just throw those numbers up there [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=817.52s)]
*  and they hide behind this curtain. And I'm not against it, but tell me who's doing the evaluation. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=821.8399999999999s)]
*  Like, I'd like to know. I want to know, like put somebody's name on it. Don't just say it's pro [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=827.68s)]
*  focus. Like that's okay. Like you got to evaluate the evaluator because we're all going to be wrong. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=832.8000000000001s)]
*  Like that doesn't mean it's the Bible. It doesn't mean it's perfect. Like just tell me who did this? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=837.6800000000001s)]
*  Is it some guy in his basement in Des Moines who doesn't ever come out except for meatloaf? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=842.64s)]
*  Like tell me the guy that does it. I want to know. And I think that's where we tend to believe this. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=846.96s)]
*  And we're so gullible. We just believe what we hear. I know because it's the easiest way to do it. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=852.24s)]
*  It's hard to say to somebody, I don't disagree. I disagree with that tape. It's hard. You get [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=856.88s)]
*  killed on it. You get killed out there. But the people that do, especially with so many [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=861.44s)]
*  self-proclaimed experts, if you don't, as Walsh would say, we're all thinking alike. No one's thinking. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=865.84s)]
*  I think another thing that makes this trade like a possible documentary someday is just that draft, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=872.08s)]
*  the top 12, where it's like Pitts, Chase, Waddle, Sewell, J.C. Horne, Sertan, Devonta Smith, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=878.8000000000001s)]
*  Fields, Michael Parsons, and Slater are all the next picks. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=886.48s)]
*  Michael Parsons is a perfect example. There was a lot of dirt on him. Whatever it was at Penn State, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=891.2s)]
*  none of it was true. None of it was coming from the Penn State people. If you just go back and [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=899.44s)]
*  watch him, you're like, oh my God, this guy's great. But all of a sudden, oh, this. There's so [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=906.4s)]
*  much misinformation. That's why if you can focus, and as Steve Jobs said, focus is about saying no [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=911.2s)]
*  to everything. If you can focus on what your task is, you'll be much better. But it's hard to do in [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=918.96s)]
*  this world, especially if you have any internet connection. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLqIXXi2LcA&t=924.72s)]
