# NFL Guess the Lines Week 4 with Cousin Sal  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VRpl_H-LfY)
*  All right, guess the lines usually when I'm dead on for guess the lines. It's usually good for my gambling
*  Which was the case last week when I nailed like six straight on so we got a good deal
*  Yeah, and it's one one one after three weeks. All right, so we're fresh start. We're basically starting
*  That even Thursday night your team is playing the Giants in
*  Giants Stadium
*  This felt like Cowboys minus three and a half to me Wow
*  Wow the disrespect I
*  Might just I may have to quit the week here because I had six and a half
*  Yeah, it's still the Giants and it's four and a half. You get it. Mm-hmm
*  If they lose, I think that ends under four. I think that gets to three and a half really? Yeah, your team's not good
*  I know you can't see it yet
*  It's fine
*  Well seems not that good
*  Okay, but don't match up against your clients what not your fault just hold that is hot hold me through the zoom
*  It's not your fault
*  Your team's not neighbors. We have my team's not good either. We have two bad things better our quarterbacks
*  Okay. All right. We always listen Dak might win nine games
*  Just just by himself, which he probably should if you're paying him 60 million dollars, but right your team's not very good
*  Okay, I guess that's it
*  I mean you usually you'll agree though
*  They usually throw a Cowboys tax in there right and three and a half or four and a half what it is doesn't seem
*  I would argue you had the Cowboys tax this week when the line was
*  One and a half when it should have been three early thought Raven the Raven. I thought the Raven should have been favored by three. Yeah
*  By the way, we didn't yeah that flip from when we bet last week. All right, I don't want to talk about that game
*  That's what the big flip from last week was that Saints Eagles Saints like five points, right?
*  Yeah, cuz the Eagles lost on Monday. Yeah, and that uh that moved it. Yeah
*  Sunday marquee
*  So I'm gonna do this one
*  Even though it's probably not the marquee, but it is for me
*  Chiefs at the Chargers chiefs come in LA Harbaugh his first time going against Andy Reid in my homes
*  Herbert probably playing I would assume
*  And assuming he does play I just think this is a really fun game and I'm excited to watch it because that's
*  I think I'm a little higher on the Chargers, especially their defense the most so I'm gonna say
*  chiefs
*  by six
*  All right
*  I'm gonna suggest we throw this out and it's not just cuz I lost I said I said chiefs by three and a half
*  But this reads for sure like he's not playing it's eight and a half. Oh
*  Oof go run it out because I won. All right fine. I mean, yeah, but all your analysis was Herbert's plan
*  I mean, he's clearly not playing this game, right?
*  Well, there's gonna be a lot of chiefs fans to 30,000 chiefs fans of that game
*  It's not eight and a half points were the chiefs fans. That's craziness. That lines too high. I agree
*  Will you look at that? I'm not I'm not screwing that up
*  Sunday 425 eight and a half, right? Okay
*  That's
*  Two injuries that doesn't look great where that one and Laporta looked like he was really hurt
*  Yeah, like we came back for a second. But yeah, did not that guy just seems jinxed. Yeah
*  All right, you get that one. You're up to nothing, but I'm surprised that already they they're assessing that he's he's out
*  Well, I'm leading to nothing already for the week. I'm excited. I have two watchable games. Oh
*  three my bad
*  There's one in the wrong category, okay first one
*  Saints at the Falcons I
*  Almost want to call this a loser leaves town match
*  But we can't because this this division is gonna be dragging dragging on for 14 more weeks. I
*  Have the Saints favorite in this game. I did Saints by one. I just think they're better
*  All right, I'm gonna get do I get this you figure out the math. Yeah, I get this
*  I said Atlanta by three
*  So I was like, you know what you don't step into Atlanta. They have the Ring of Honor with the owner in there
*  Right Atlanta by one and a half. Yeah, you did get that. I was off one and a half. You were off three
*  I think that could move that could tighten up
*  Atlanta by one and a half interesting
*  Did we did we hammer Raheem Morris hard enough in the pod can't remember
*  I mean, I guess there were so many bad coaches today, but I
*  Special kudos to him for those terrible awful third and fourth down calls. I mean that last fourth down. I
*  Don't know man. I've seen I've seen so many up the middle that didn't make it
*  I've seen so many jet sweeps that didn't make it. I don't even know what the right call is on for that
*  What about the timeout so they get a first down? It's under a minute left. There's a play and then he just calls timeout
*  Right then the next play read calls timeout before Raheem Morris is able to call timeout
*  Which should told him how dumb the first timeout was exactly. Yeah, right. There's a minute left. You're on the 15
*  There's no you keep your three timeouts in case you don't get it. Yeah, the clock running either way make the Chiefs call timeout
*  He's just completely mangled it. Yeah, he was terrible the last time he was a head coach
*  Yeah, but I thought he'd be better this time because everyone was talking about what a great defensive coordinator was
*  But when he was a head coach for Tampa, he was awful
*  Didn't we make a deal with ourselves that we were gonna wait till after three games and then bet Atlanta to win the division
*  It's like they could be 0 and 3 or 1 and 2 or something now. They're plus 180 in their home
*  I guess if you think they're gonna lose this one
*  Then you wait even longer, but we did make a deal that we never thought we had to wait until oh
*  I guess this was the week
*  Yeah, wait, so what it so they're alright, I'm going to Fandel so they are
*  Saints are plus 145
*  Falcons plus 180
*  Tampa's plus 260 because they were a minus to start the year, right?
*  So we were like now just wait a few weeks and they could be one and two or all in three
*  What team do you like more?
*  Yes, that's what it comes down to I
*  Like the Saints team. I saw last week beat the shit out of my my Cowboys. That's the team
*  That should win the division. I like the Saints a little more
*  Okay, next one is Eagles at the Bucs
*  Eagles have to be favored in this game. I'm gonna say Eagles by one and a half at Tampa
*  I got this exactly right unless it changed. I said two and a half and it is
*  Sorry, still two and a half. Yeah, Philly's favorite
*  That's a playoff rematch, right
*  The Bucs waxed them the last time so either that's a playoff rematch
*  Bucs feeling confident because they beat them the last time. Yeah, or the Eagles mad that they beat them the last time
*  I never know. I didn't never know how that works. Yeah, let me know how that turns out. Yeah, I'll never figure that one out
*  next one is Packers at the Vikings this
*  Arguably could have been the marquee game, but I didn't know if Malik Willis was playing or not
*  Malik Willis was good was pretty good today
*  very good, I mean
*  Maybe I'm crediting the coach too much, but Malik Willis didn't screw up he ran along with that team
*  They pounded the ball and that defense I guess we should talk more about the Packers young
*  Excellent defense that already has six interceptions and when they had seven all of last year
*  very very good well he cost me money twice because
*  He cost me money last week because I bet against the Packers
*  Only because of Malik Willis because of his career to that point and they they won
*  So I stayed away this week, but then with Skyler Thompson
*  I was like I just want to bet against Skyler Thompson
*  He's in Seattle that the Seattle's defense should just kill him like what are we doing right?
*  But I was so scared off by the Malik Willis thing. I held off. Oh wow. It's almost like a second loss
*  Scared me off of the Skyler Thompson money, so fuck you a second time Malik Willis
*  He's responsible. I lost them now again. All your bad bets here going forward. I have the Packers
*  At home right yeah Packers on yep
*  Minus one and a half over Minnesota. Oh, I narrowly beat you I said three it's two and a half
*  So that's a line that it's good game that that's a line that is saying Jordan loves playing loves playing yeah
*  I think he wanted to go to factored that in
*  too late I
*  Should have cheated this week. I forgot to cheat. That's a fun one
*  That's a good one early on I like that yeah that probably should have been the Sunday marquee game of loves playing yeah
*  I'm gonna flip that even though it doesn't matter because we already did the podcast I'm gonna flip that just for my own records
*  Fairly watchable as I got five
*  Jets Broncos not a terrible game
*  Yeah, it's uh it's a Jets home game
*  And I think the Broncos showed enough today that they moved that line under seven. I've Jets by six and a half all right
*  I'm making a move here. I said seven at seven and a half. Oh
*  It's a little too high
*  Three to two good guys
*  So the Broncos had a really good second half against the Steelers and played a really good complete game
*  Today so they've been good for a game and a half, and I think that line's too high
*  Well we didn't talk about the Jets at all because it was a Thursday game
*  I guess you talked about it on Friday, but I
*  Think people need to calm down just a little bit just a little bit with Aaron Rodgers in the Jets just and I'm not saying
*  This because I don't like whatever I had them Thursday. I think they're a playoff team
*  Yeah, but they played a bottom five team. Sorry you shit on my team enough today
*  I had them I I'm insulted you said bottom five there about three things
*  I dare you to cost about bottom three I take it back of three
*  I would never there's all do again three worse teams than us bottom three bottom five on three days rest
*  So anything could happen and they took advantage, but he looked good. He looked good. It wasn't wasn't forced that I mean
*  I'd like design rollouts out of the pocket. I think he was forced out too much. I thought he looked good
*  I thought he made good for us a little bit high tiny bit
*  Texans are home
*  for the Jaguars
*  So I
*  Have Texans by three and a half, but I think if the Jaguars look good
*  I think this line goes under three but for now I get you text and three and a half
*  I said four it's four and a half. I went a little higher
*  These are good division games mini Green Bay Jacksonville Houston. That's a nice chalk cake Casey chargers. I
*  Think that's an underdog pick. So
*  The Jags got I'm gonna bet the Jags again. Just honestly just clubbed me in the head
*  We have to know that's too many points the Jags have a good pass rush
*  So Texans can't block anyone but you can get to strap. Yeah
*  And they can't run the ball we'll see if they get a mix them back next week
*  But they couldn't run the ball which is problem. Okay, next one Steelers at Indianapolis. This is your team
*  You should get this I was off by half a point Steelers by two and a half. I
*  Said two it's one and a half. Look at this. Look how I'm elbowing out of here. Damn it. I promise look
*  No, I got I believe you. I'm not like you. I don't when I'm losing. I don't use the other person of cheating
*  I think like like you're the real-life
*  2014 Indianapolis Colts, you're just accusing when you're losing just lash out. I don't know why you don't do that
*  I think that's a character flaw to be honest
*  That line should be
*  That line should be up to two and a half or three by game time because
*  Anthony Richardson against that Steelers defense is not gonna be pretty
*  At some point they have to take like they could take one game a month off the Steelers defense, right?
*  I don't know man. That's not what defenses do. I think watts possessed this year. Yeah
*  Last one I put Bears Rams as a fairly watchables only cuz I don't know what the F to expect from either of these teams
*  It's definitely not a poop feck the game and the Rams really won my respect today, but you're gonna get this
*  Am I cuz I have the Bears favored by one and a half. Yeah, you got it exactly
*  I had the Rams favored by three then I talked me out talk me out of this why the Bears are favored. I
*  Don't know I think because the Rams got super lucky today and probably should be
*  You know oh and three
*  Well, I mean if anyone should be all in three
*  Okay. Yeah, the Bears got super lucky against the Titans. Yeah, we'll have us eight turnovers this year
*  Forget to shout him out so good. Yeah, so good eight turnovers in three games. What a pace for JJ made that his best bet
*  I mean imagine you're giving points with Will Levis, you know right away. It's over
*  There's different ways to do these best bets
*  I I am personally not a I'm gonna like my best bet of the week a bad quarterback or a bad team
*  I just I don't purse I can't personally do it. I don't like betting on bad teams because I just think there's
*  Too much variance
*  I'm the same way. I think you bet underdogs if you make a living betting underdogs
*  You you'll live eight years shorter because you're betting on a bad quarterback to do a good thing in the fourth quarter
*  Poop Fecta
*  Bengals Panthers you could argue this is a fairly re what fairly watchable because the Dalton going against his
*  Yeah, hold is he in the Bengals Ring of Honor or no?
*  300 yards three touchdowns. Yeah took us to seven playoff games
*  Here he is. I
*  Have the Bengals right in the Vegas zone
*  Length five points in Carolina. All right, you're gonna get it. It's five and a half. Hmm
*  Yeah, he was um
*  Yeah, he was instrumental. He was in the shaky's game every every year, right?
*  Dalton he was that Saturday game him and against Matt Schaub wasn't I see Dalton and I just think of
*  Warm kind of gross pizza that might give you diarrhea in a couple hours. I
*  See his face. That's my that's my instinct
*  That's going on the ball wondering what I did what wondering why I had that sausage pizza slice
*  He's gonna get you back by putting up six W's for Carolina moving that an NFC Sal total up to 33
*  here's
*  Here's a hard line forty diners at home for the terrible New England Patriots
*  Yeah, I
*  Went with forty diners by nine
*  Yeah, I
*  Went seven and a half you're gonna get it. It's ten and a half. I was way off
*  I just didn't think ten and a half's existed anymore. Honestly, is that our first one?
*  We didn't have one last week, right? I don't know if we've had a double figures one. Yeah, that's our first one. Let's see
*  This would be Jacobi Brissett's last start
*  It's the first one the Bengals didn't give the Patriots ten, right?
*  That never got to ten that would have been the closest one. Yes first one. This is the farewell start for Jacobi. Oh really?
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah, you said this is the last one he sits. This is it
*  Yeah, Drake may will be the starter for week five against Miami. Okay, I'm predicting that I think that's the right move
*  Let's get him out there. Let's see what he's got
*  Don't be scared off by the Bryce Young thing maybe think more CJ Strad last year just get him out have him run around I
*  Think it'll be okay. I think that's fair. What's that game again? What's the game five? No week five game five is home for Miami
*  It's perfect. Okay, great
*  Here's your competition
*  Skylar Thompson Skylar Murray. Yeah, just be better than the Skylar Murray Thompson
*  Maybe you should I fit it Skylar Murray Thompson
*  Cardinals are at home for the Washington C words
*  and
*  I was surprised I bumped this to cards minus four
*  See now you're now you're making a run here. I think it's four and a half. Yeah, it's four and a half
*  I said three and a half
*  So you get it. I
*  Think there's a cards
*  Parlay with some adjusted under I think is worth considering because both of those score points like the cards money line
*  And you take the under I say I'm not sorry the over but you adjust it down
*  So it's like over 40 and just parlay that together and that's a high over that
*  Is that the highest over the week 4950 49 and a half, but that's the highest of the week
*  I guess it might be one two versus secondary. So get that down to like 42 something like that
*  Not bad. Yeah
*  Two good garbage time touchdown teams to mm-hmm where the games over but they're just driving like it's the sister
*  Last poop fact the game is poop tastic
*  Raiders Browns
*  It is a spilled portage on a poop
*  It's in Vegas
*  I have no idea who should be favored. I almost want to do Raiders pick them, but I did Raiders minus one I
*  Did Raiders minus two
*  It's Browns minus one half Wow that surprised you get that
*  You love you love the Raiders on a teaser getting more than a touch. No, you'll love it on the Raiders ever
*  especially after
*  The coach coming out and just bashing the players in the in
*  2024 I don't know if that works when you've when the coach has basically done nothing, right?
*  It's not like he's like a three-time Super Bowl champ, right? He won a couple games last year down the stretch
*  Yeah, now he's just calling guys out taking shots. Yeah
*  I it just doesn't work. We've we have lots of evidence in the last five six years that this is a bad strategy
*  Yeah, coach. I appreciate the criticism, but I don't know if you remember you punted on fourth and one from 43 last
*  Six days ago. I didn't try as hard this week, but I still can't believe you punted from the 40 yard line
*  So I made some business decisions today. I will say this if you bet on this game
*  You might need to go to a meeting
*  Well, they gave us they're doing better. It's eight and four eight
*  1 p.m. Kickoffs and four four p.m. Or 425 whatever. So
*  Yeah, there are other games. You don't need to do this one
*  With this little outdoor area my in my house
*  And I didn't want to put a TV out there and then my wife was like put on a TV
*  I know you're gonna use it. We should put one out there. I'm like, alright fine
*  I was out there for the late games today. It was just I felt like a new man
*  It's really because you're just sitting indoors watching TV for you know, ten hours
*  It's just to be outdoors for three hours watching a TV with the little four box on it
*  I was like, this is great. I'm having a great time. It does make you feel a little less shitty about yourself, right? Yeah, it really does
*  there's
*  I'm sorry about this, but I've only heard about this but there's the leaving the strip club when it's light out feeling like oh boy
*  What's what where's my life? And then there's yeah look further further down is what about what about still playing blackjack?
*  When they're vacuuming under the table, but yeah
*  Which you've personally witnessed with me
*  That would have been a better example I should have used. I'm sorry. It was a little sketchy. Fortunately. We're fortunately. We're not live
*  Oh, no, we are place same place Vegas
*  Sunday night
*  Ravens bills, this is a really good game great Lamar. Jaha
*  These two guys
*  You think you have them stop Mike you think you got him and they just pull a play
*  Right out of their butt cheeks Mike
*  Right out of your butt you try to tackle my god. We're going on the field now
*  I dare you you do everything right and he just plows over and gets four more yards Mike
*  That was a great play. I will say the first first down
*  When he when he held the ball he dicked the director and everyone and the announcer still Brady still thinks that uh, it was a sweep left
*  And then and then the pass on
*  The flowers he pulled it out that's what he lives for you know
*  He lives for those moments. Yeah those moments. I
*  Have Ravens minus three against Buffalo. I think we split this it's two and a half. I said two
*  Wait, let's add these up one two three. I have to be winning. Come on eight two three four
*  You're winning by two
*  One of the Monday's
*  You're winning by two
*  One of the Monday night games they have two again one I'm off by
*  One and a half points so you could write you could wrap it up with this first one. Damn it two Monday night games again. Mm-hmm
*  The first one stinks Dolphins Titans Skyler Thompson against Scott. No, what's it? What do we call him?
*  Scott Murray Thompson, Skyler Murray hyphen types. Yeah
*  against Will Levis
*  the Titans
*  Fired Mike Vrabel replace them with a guy who's like will Levis is my guy
*  Malik Willis goes to this other team and somehow they've rejuvenated him in two weeks and it's not going great for 10
*  Is there a Malik Levis because that would in that's another that would get super man. So confusing. Yeah, I
*  Have the Dolphins favored by two and a half over the Titans
*  son of a bitch
*  You were way off
*  But I was way or off
*  I said minus three
*  Tennessee's favor by one and a half. Oh my god. It's almost like they saw
*  It's almost like they saw
*  Skyler Thompson played quarterback today
*  Jesus
*  But love is again how the mighty have fallen is it this is unbelievable
*  The Dolphins are getting points against will Levis and week four
*  All right
*  I gotta see something this will have us was he favored three times this year?
*  No, he wasn't favored against the Bears was he twice?
*  Was he favored against the bit no, so I wrapped it up. Yeah. All right Monday night
*  Second game pretty good one lions against the Seahawks
*  Seahawks a little banged up. So I bumped this a little toward the Lions had the Lions by five
*  We're gonna split it I said four it's four and a half. So you win ten two eight
*  Wait we have one more bonus bet go on Tuesday night midnight East Coast time
*  The premiere of mr. McMahon on Netflix. Oh, yeah home game against the Menendez brothers
*  What episodes the monster the Menendez brothers that's right looks right now
*  Mr. McMahon, I don't who's favorite in that mr. McMahon. I mean, there's two Menendez brothers
*  Yeah, so that's a dog a double. Well, can I just say this on your behalf the Menendez brothers say don't watch it
*  They are not happy with how they were portrayed. So
*  Yeah, I don't know. Maybe mr. McMahon isn't either but and let me just say I saw it. Thank you for the advanced screening
*  I fucking loved it. It's like crack cocaine to me and I loved it. I want to
*  I don't like you had anything to with it. No, it was great. It was great. You you picked all the perfect spots
*  Let me just say that and I also thought it was fair
