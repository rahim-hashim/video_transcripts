# Million-Dollar Picks Week 5 With Joe House | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0)
*  All right million dollar picks is here week five is ahead of us [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=0.0s)]
*  We didn't do that well last week, but we also kind of were expecting a weird [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=4.32s)]
*  Wonky week, so we scaled back which was smart. We're still up [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=9.24s)]
*  197,000 dollars for the season good have good news for your house. I really like week five [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=13.56s)]
*  I like week one we did well. I liked week three we did well and [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=17.72s)]
*  I like week five. Okay, we're on odd weeks. You like the odd weeks. Maybe I do [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  I have two stayaways four games. I'm intrigued and then five games. I mark down [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=27.76s)]
*  So the stayaways to me, and I think you like this game is Bears Panthers [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  Bears minus three and a half and my instinct is oh [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=40.2s)]
*  That bear shouldn't be fair by that much up against anybody but [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=44.44s)]
*  And there's really good [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=48.44s)]
*  Panthers D stats for the Bears I get all of it. I just don't trust the Bears. I don't I'm staying away [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=50.92s)]
*  Yeah, I've had 24 hours, you know as the week goes on and we're on the podcast [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=55.879999999999995s)]
*  We did the East Coast by a show that was on vandal TV, and I really liked the Bears [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=61.16s)]
*  I'll confess I've lost some of my enthusiasm because the numbers for the Panthers offense [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=66.2s)]
*  Especially their ability to establish the run [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=72.4s)]
*  Yeah, are very good and that is if you're looking at that Bears defense the reason I really you know felt [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=75.24s)]
*  Strongly about the Bears earlier the week was because that defense I think is legit [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  I think they're gonna prove out to be a top five defense over the course of the year [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=86.88s)]
*  Really good stats with them their weakness is the run and the Panthers have a good effing offensive line [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  And can run the ball a little bit with my guy Chubba Hubba. So I'm fine with the stay away now [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=97.91999999999999s)]
*  The there's a world where Caleb has an awesome game like the Panthers are bottom three and literally every pressure stat [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=105.28s)]
*  The 30-second red zone 26 yards per play their defense, but I want to see it. So I'm staying away [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=112.11999999999999s)]
*  Broncos Raiders, I really wanted to take the Broncos [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=118.72s)]
*  Me too. I think the Raiders stink they do [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  They were super lucky to win last week the Browns the Sean was the second [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=126.52s)]
*  Like most efficient quarterback last week had two big plays pulled back [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=132.36s)]
*  I just don't think they should have won that game and I don't think they're good [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=136.26000000000002s)]
*  But I really don't want to bet on Bo Nicks [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=139.32s)]
*  I know coming off a 60-yard game where it feels like if he sucks this week [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=141.72s)]
*  He'll get benched in the first half. It just it feels like a stay away [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=146.68s)]
*  So I don't I don't think that's gonna happen and the reason to take Denver is because they have they also have [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=150.36s)]
*  What might turn out to be a top five defense? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=157.44s)]
*  I mean the performance that they had against the Jets last week at MetLife. Yeah was so effing impressive [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=159.88s)]
*  And that was right on the heels of a very good performance in Tampa two road games that defense is traveling [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=166.92s)]
*  it's a badass defense and if where you're saying is that the defense is the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=174.64s)]
*  Deciding factor against the Raiders and it's not a huge line then you do it, but I'm kind of with you [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=179.8s)]
*  It feels like a little early now. I feel like you could talk me into it numbers D [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=184.96s)]
*  First in yards per play third and third down second and red zone second and sacks and hits [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=189.4s)]
*  I'm going to pass I know here's the other thing the Raiders can't run the ball. They're 31st against the run [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=194.92s)]
*  Whites hurt they're playing Madison a little bit more who I don't think is very good [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=201.68s)]
*  And there's a world where they just fall behind seven nothing and the game's over [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=206.32s)]
*  you could maybe talk me into a little Denver first half Denver game if [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=210.44s)]
*  You put like two drinks in me all right, so maybe maybe we'll revisit that all right intrigued [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=214.88s)]
*  We're not going to do this because I'm so happy for you with with everything that's happening with Washington [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=220.44s)]
*  your team the c-words [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=225.6s)]
*  They are such an obvious [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  Zag to take the Browns plus three nobody wants take the Browns nobody not one person and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=231.68s)]
*  Everyone's on the Washington bandwagon it was just a week of hugs and high-fives and congratulations and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=238.92s)]
*  Champagne being popped and I don't like any of it. I think this is the most dangerous game. I've seen in five weeks [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  Do stay away. It's at very least. It's a stay away [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=254.28s)]
*  I mean I'll make the case on on our rigor pregame show on Sunday [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=257.32s)]
*  I mean you just have to bet the Browns. It's an auto bet the Browns [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=262.22s)]
*  There's no scenario under which this look ahead line was Cleveland minus three [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=265.6s)]
*  in so six point shift a six point swing in favor and and that's because [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=270.88s)]
*  Properly the whole world is celebrating the arrival of the beautiful rookie Jaden Daniels. It's a wonderful thing new president [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=277.48s)]
*  President of something I'm looking forward by it [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=286.8s)]
*  We don't know where Biden is I think Jaden Daniels is our new leader in Washington [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=289.96000000000004s)]
*  Daniels and in Kingsbury for 20, you know 24 [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  But I mean the line is preposterous and the Browns defense has the potential to really [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=299.15999999999997s)]
*  Flummox this this Washington offense. I mean it will be by quite a bit the best defense. Look at this [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=306.96s)]
*  Look at me. That's the MJ can't hear it, but I did a good luck dream team MJ Cup because we need wins this week [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=314.28s)]
*  Yeah, let's do it. We'll stay away, but I'll take the bar. All right. All right. All right [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=320.59999999999997s)]
*  next one [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=324.91999999999996s)]
*  Texans bills [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=327.52s)]
*  Texans are 1.5 dogs at home and everyone's off them. It's very similar to the Lions last week. Everyone was off the Lions [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=329.28s)]
*  Well, we've seen three games the Lions offense isn't good anymore. It was the one thing. I was really right about last week [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=336.47999999999996s)]
*  I was I'm not giving up on the Lions offense after three games and Seattle can't stop the run. They're banged up [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=342.23999999999995s)]
*  I think they're I think the Lions were on a mock. There's a case with the Texans [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=347.28s)]
*  But I credit you earlier when talking to high fits you made the point about how awesome mixing was in week one [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=352.44s)]
*  Against a Colts defense that seemed like it was hot garbage and has actually been a little better as the seasons gone along [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=359.2s)]
*  But are they this power rushing team that hasn't figured out their identity yet? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=364.96s)]
*  I wish this game was like six weeks from now with Joe mixing and I would take I would take them as home dogs [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=369.36s)]
*  against this bill's team because I don't think those defense is good and [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=376.24s)]
*  All right, go backwards they beat Arizona week one. Well now after four weeks that seems less impressive [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=379.96s)]
*  They killed Miami in week two. Well, it's Miami was bad even before the two injury and [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=386.76s)]
*  I don't know. I kind of like the Texans, but I just don't want to bet against Josh Allen. That's where I landed [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=393.47999999999996s)]
*  yeah, the case for the Texans and I think it's a decent case is [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=400.24s)]
*  They are in control of [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=404.68s)]
*  Putting an end to defeating themselves [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=408.44s)]
*  They're one of the most penalized teams in the NFL and like the net penalty yard differential [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=410.56s)]
*  If you look at you know, how many penalties they have and the yards they've been penalized compared to other teams [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=415.92s)]
*  It's bad and it has the effect of putting CJ Stroud in these third and long [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=420.96000000000004s)]
*  Situations again and again and again and it's super hard to get first downs on third long now [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=426.96000000000004s)]
*  They do have the best receiver room in the NFL. Well, but that's del's been hurt [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=432.78s)]
*  Yeah, so that's that's one one of the considerations [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=438.58s)]
*  But I don't mix in the version of what we just saw Baltimore do to that to the middle of the bills defense [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=441.65999999999997s)]
*  You think that Houston could be taking some instruction from that but I'm fine with was staying away from it [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=449.14s)]
*  But I think the case for Houston is compelling. It's a picks pool pick. I don't know if it's a put money on a pick [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=455.21999999999997s)]
*  I'd even be afraid to throw them in a tease even though they're dying for us to do that too because every tease is lost [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=461.54s)]
*  all year I [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=467.98s)]
*  Was so excited on Monday night chip as I was chasing bets and winning and I put the Titans in a couple teases and [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=471.1s)]
*  They actually like came through and they won handily [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=479.18s)]
*  But of course I could have just bet them straight up same thing would have happened [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=481.9s)]
*  So I'm not giving up on the Texans yet. I just don't love the spot [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=484.74s)]
*  But I also wouldn't be surprised if they had their shit together. There's also the Stefan Diggs. There's the revenge angle there [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=490.42s)]
*  You know, he's gonna do something. I don't like that bills. I thought that bills defense [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=497.21999999999997s)]
*  was [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=502.34s)]
*  Just annihilated last week and I also thought they couldn't block the Ravens now that might be because the Ravens are really good [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=503.62s)]
*  But I think the Texans can pressure Alan so I do like them. I think by Sunday. I'm gonna talk myself into them [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=509.38s)]
*  I'm not doing it now next one [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=515.38s)]
*  Pat's [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=517.66s)]
*  offense [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=518.78s)]
*  Pat's somehow [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=520.3s)]
*  favored in this game [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=522.6999999999999s)]
*  Which I don't fully understand when you think about [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=524.38s)]
*  What is the line now? Yeah, Pat's are minus one and a half [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=528.5s)]
*  Their offensive line was bad to begin with and now they've lost 80% of the offensive line [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=533.5s)]
*  Including their center who is the one good guy in the line? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=538.8s)]
*  It's they've lost guys on defense they've lost bar more they traded judon [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=542.78s)]
*  They lost their one good linebacker Bentley and the guy who's are played every Kyle and I we watched the Pats [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=547.86s)]
*  But the guy who replaces Bentley McMillan is one of the worst Pats. We've had in a while. No offense to him [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=553.54s)]
*  They lost Duggar and they're just a mess and this really seems like it's a race for the 32nd spot in the league. I [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=558.82s)]
*  Almost want to take the points [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=566.5s)]
*  But Miami was so bad last week and now they just lost another guy and I don't know [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=568.26s)]
*  Is this like a best part in the field game you just ride Tyreek I [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=574.14s)]
*  Mean maybe but thankfully we don't have to bet every game on the slate. This is a classic bad teams [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=578.98s)]
*  Yeah, this is a classic sometimes the best bet you make is the one you didn't make or whatever [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=584.5s)]
*  I messed it up, but yeah, do you want you want to try? What were you trying to say there? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=589.5s)]
*  Talk through it. We're both old [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=595.14s)]
*  sometimes [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=597.26s)]
*  The best bet in a situation is the one you don't make I don't know there's a version of that [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=598.46s)]
*  That has you got there. You almost landed the plane. There's less words. You can we're not getting drunk house today [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=604.4200000000001s)]
*  We're getting drove. Just drove my kid to basketball practice house, which is just [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=609.38s)]
*  Yeah, little little little flustered little flummoxed we're good part of me wanted to do the this part after [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=615.6600000000001s)]
*  the the Falcons game tonight and [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=622.94s)]
*  Just tell you to just have three drinks because people like drunk house [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=626.2199999999999s)]
*  All right. So one thing I was thinking about Miami game was Miami first half Miami game is plus 165 [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=629.26s)]
*  Seven nothing three nothing. It's probably over. All right last game that I was intrigued by [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=638.74s)]
*  And I feel like you're gonna rope me into this and I'm already pissed off about it Jaguars [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=644.26s)]
*  Jaguars [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=649.4599999999999s)]
*  minus two and a half at [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=651.26s)]
*  Home against the Colts the Jaguars are owned for [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=653.3s)]
*  They have some of the worst metrics of any team in the league for some of the advanced stuff [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=656.3s)]
*  They're 30 their defense is 31st against the pass [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=660.5s)]
*  28th again in the red zone 26 first down their offense is 29th yards per play [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=664.3s)]
*  31st of the past somehow their bottom two passing both sides [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=670.02s)]
*  their last in turnovers [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=674.14s)]
*  They've committed the most and they forced the least [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=676.86s)]
*  Every and they're the dumbest team we've ever seen they're 11 for 44 and third down [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=680.34s)]
*  They just suck in every absolute respect in these defenses quietly 50 yards per play now [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=684.9s)]
*  Which I think we left after week one thinking they were disaster [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=691.14s)]
*  And yet I kind of like the Jaguars [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=695.02s)]
*  Who've cost us money over and over again this season if you have to make a play is the Jaguars? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=697.74s)]
*  They are you know the situation is perfect for them they haven't lost at home [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=704.34s)]
*  They both covered and and won straight up against the Colts for eight years running now [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=710.6600000000001s)]
*  They know against you sent me that I'm trying to you trying to rope me into a Jaguars bet [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=716.82s)]
*  I know what you're doing. Let's not do it. Let's not do it. It's a great. Why'd you send me that? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=721.6s)]
*  Why did you send me that text? I just wanted to say I wanted to say it out loud [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=726.26s)]
*  I wanted to be said out loud that this is a great spot for Jacksonville [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=730.32s)]
*  I really like Jacksonville. Here's the problem though if the Colts start Joe fucking Flacco. I want no [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=734.34s)]
*  Thank you [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=740.26s)]
*  Decide that on Thursday. I talked to the hyphids about that before they start flacco. I think the Colts [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=742.26s)]
*  I'm afraid oh yeah, and then when he came into the Pittsburgh game. I was mad we go with that was it [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=747.0600000000001s)]
*  We were cooked that was the end of it [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=753.62s)]
*  so [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=756.0600000000001s)]
*  The Colts are plus 440 to win the division on Fandel right now [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=758.1800000000001s)]
*  Do you know that I did not know that I haven't checked Colts number. Yeah, so what's our there two and two right? Yeah [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=762.76s)]
*  Then Houston is three and one yes [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=770.84s)]
*  There's a world where they're tied after week five [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=775.76s)]
*  And I [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=781.0400000000001s)]
*  Don't understand the Indianapolis thing, but they do have some talent like Taylor was running really good last week before he got a little [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=782.84s)]
*  Dinged up they have a good line. They have a good line. That's why yeah [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=788.98s)]
*  They last week especially they are well coached, but I was thinking like [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=794.3000000000001s)]
*  That plus 440 if Buffalo beats Houston and Indianapolis beats Jaguars drops down to like plus 120 [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=798.3000000000001s)]
*  Mmm just the thought I'm not gonna do it all right just the thought all right [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=807.5s)]
*  It's pretty beat up the Colts right now. They've got a bunch of bad guys Buckner [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=811.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, let's talk about the games we like so there's a London game [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=815.82s)]
*  Yes, we get rich eyes and back in the play-by-play. I know he's one of your play-by-play favorites [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=820.94s)]
*  Vikings [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=828.38s)]
*  Minus two and a half against the Jets in London [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=829.98s)]
*  Yeah [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=832.82s)]
*  And I kept thinking this line was a mistake and I didn't understand why it wasn't three or three and a half and I get [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=833.34s)]
*  It the Vikings are four and oh against the spread [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=839.7600000000001s)]
*  The kicking ass all season Brian Flores he got his mojo back after two cut his knees out [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=842.4399999999999s)]
*  Minnesota's first in DVO DB away after four weeks which ain't nothing the Jets are 20th [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=850.68s)]
*  Minnesota's defense is second against the run the Jets offense is 27th, and I think Brice Hall is dead [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=858.24s)]
*  Minnesota's first in sacks second in QB hits first in QB hurries and second in tackles for a loss [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=865.08s)]
*  oh and their fourth in scoring points and [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=871.8s)]
*  They bet their offense has been good all year and then you have the Jets who can't run the ball [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=875.56s)]
*  Who have just a bad coach by NFL standards? He's one of the five worst coaches [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=880.4399999999999s)]
*  They had a combination of a loss last week salad either one right take your pick [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=886.12s)]
*  it applies to both of them and [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=891.84s)]
*  Rogers got the shit kicked out of him last week and then admitted afterwards that he's banged up [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=894.64s)]
*  Yeah, and five sacks five sacks he took so normally I would say [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=899.36s)]
*  This looks too easy [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=904.8000000000001s)]
*  Vikings they're too hot. This is that we've seen this day. It's London. Don't bet on the London game [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=906.6800000000001s)]
*  House this just looks to me like the worst-case [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=913.2800000000001s)]
*  Team for jets for the Jets to play for Rogers play when they already can't really block and you're gonna have Flores [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=916.08s)]
*  Just going after Rogers. I don't think he wants to get a hit and [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=921.76s)]
*  I like the Vikings. Yeah, I'm [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=925.36s)]
*  in the same place and [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=928.28s)]
*  It does feel like kind of a we're buying the Vikings at the top of the the price market here [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=930.5999999999999s)]
*  And I looked at the the look-ahead. What do you think the look-ahead was for this game preseason? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=937.4s)]
*  What do you think it was coming? Oh my god [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=942.52s)]
*  It had to have been what Jets by four and a half four Jets by four. Yeah, right [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=943.8199999999999s)]
*  So this is a six and a half point swing, but I think it's entirely [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=948.18s)]
*  Appropriate on both sides of the ball and the fact that it's less than three is to me [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=953.72s)]
*  enticing and and really the point you made about Flores and his ability to [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=961.44s)]
*  Bring the Blitz is what's got me more than anything bullish about this because Flores has gone up against [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=966.72s)]
*  The Shanahan, you know sort of coaching tree. Yeah, that's been all their games so far [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=974.44s)]
*  Yeah, he played played Shanahan and he beat him [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=980.16s)]
*  You know and and now he gets the the worst of them in Hackett [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=984.72s)]
*  And I know that they're gonna blitz they're gonna blitz a lot and the Denver just showed us how to do that [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=990.24s)]
*  the other thing is I'm wondering quietly if the Jets defense is is overrated because [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=996.12s)]
*  We've seen them shut down the Broncos and Bo Nicks [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1002.2s)]
*  We've seen them shut down the Patriots and we've seen them shut down the Titans [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1006.24s)]
*  They played three horrific quarterbacks and now they're going against Arnold in a revenge game and we're gonna do the revenge parlay later, but [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1013.08s)]
*  They're now they're going against team that's shown they can run the ball and throw the ball [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1021.12s)]
*  Yeah, the other thing with Minnesota like some of the advanced stats because now we're in like week four [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1024.56s)]
*  We were through four weeks. So we actually have stuff to look at and [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1029.36s)]
*  The Minnesota stats got kind of fucked up by that weird Packers comeback. They're up 20 and nothing [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1032.96s)]
*  They're killing them and then the guy muffs upon also 28 7 now [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1037.52s)]
*  They're in changing their defense because they're just trying to check the lead and all sudden the Packers make a couple plays and that game was [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1042.28s)]
*  stupid [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1048.0800000000002s)]
*  Minnesota is dominant and I'm a believer [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1049.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm a believer in their defense and that you know, the Jets are averaging 18 at points a game [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1052.44s)]
*  They have no explosive plays at all [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1057.3600000000001s)]
*  They're talking about trading for Devante Adams all week Rogers and Sala people are talking about that [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1059.28s)]
*  This almost feels like a Sala they leave them in London game. Oh wow. Yeah [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1064.6399999999999s)]
*  This is like a worst-case scenario Jets game now [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1071.92s)]
*  We've seen weird shit happen with the London games. Yes, and that's the only thing that scares me [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1075.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, we the pushback to that is the favorites now are like 34 and 10 some incredible number for favorites in [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1081.48s)]
*  London games, so if you were like on the fence at all, yeah, I'll take it up and we're taking the Vikings [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1088.92s)]
*  I can source that I can source that I know it I [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1095.08s)]
*  Don't I don't know what's happening like the Jets lose that Broncos game. I know the weather was bad [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1098.6s)]
*  It's one of the worst losses of the year when you have it [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1104.4s)]
*  You're playing a team at home that cannot move the ball and you still lose. Wow. They took a beating [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1107.1s)]
*  That's that's the part of it that that you know to take a beating like that at home [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1112.32s)]
*  And then the whole organization has to get on airplanes and fly over to the place with the crazy, you know different time zone [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1116.56s)]
*  Let's let me know I'll take the team that I feel like it's gonna show up prepared and organized. Well, here's another one [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1123.3999999999999s)]
*  This one jumped out at me to Ravens Bengals Baltimore at Cincy and this has [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1130.96s)]
*  You talk yourself into the case for Cincy home dog. I get all the trends and stuff. Yeah [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1136.56s)]
*  This is a nightmare matchup for the Bengals the Ravens are first and run [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1143.1s)]
*  Their offense first and run stopping on defense the Bengals can't run the ball and they can't stop the run [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1148.54s)]
*  This is the worst possible team for them to play you can throw anything else to me [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1154.5s)]
*  And I just like fundamentally Ravens are gonna be able to run the ball [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1158.54s)]
*  And the Bengals won't be able to run the ball and that's it. How do they how do the Ravens lose this game? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1162.1799999999998s)]
*  I can't figure it out [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1167.62s)]
*  Except for they they've lost two games already and we there was no world in which you could come up with the pathway for them to lose [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1169.18s)]
*  to the Raiders but they throw a [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1177.14s)]
*  I get it throw away week one because week one there's no preseason week two [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1180.66s)]
*  They're winning the games over and then all I just blow it to the Raiders team that that's gonna be the dumb result to the [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1184.5200000000002s)]
*  Year and now they look I'm in on this Ravens team. Did you see that couple Lamar and Derek Henry? It was great [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1191.5200000000002s)]
*  It was great. I was like, oh I'm betting these guys. Yeah, so here's the [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1197.3799999999999s)]
*  reasons to be cautious with with the Ravens that the price is as high as you're gonna get right because everybody just watched them on [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1203.34s)]
*  That national stage humiliate the bill, but it's under a field goal still I know so that that that is attractive [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1211.4199999999998s)]
*  But you know the look-ahead was since e minus one and a half [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1217.8999999999999s)]
*  So it's moved, you know all the way up to two and a half for Baltimore [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1221.22s)]
*  It is a divisional game [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1225.26s)]
*  But let me ask you what you think the line would be if since he had closed out that game [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1226.38s)]
*  Against the Chiefs they should have won that chiefs that chiefs game. They had the chiefs game won [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1233.8600000000001s)]
*  They would be two and two sitting here right now ready to host, you know the crucial divisional game [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1238.82s)]
*  What would that line be? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1244.74s)]
*  Probably a pointless yeah, so boss still Baltimore probably favored because of the way that they looked against Buffalo, right? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1248.06s)]
*  Yeah, but I'm in [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1255.22s)]
*  We do this with NBA too [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1257.1000000000001s)]
*  I just think Ravens regular season Ravens is is been the best one of the best bets of the league the last a great call [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1258.7s)]
*  It's a great call and they're just built to win these games you go against him like fuck [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1265.46s)]
*  Yeah, you know [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1270.94s)]
*  We can't run the ball at all and they're running all over us and I'll tell you that just this hill piece of it too [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1271.8600000000001s)]
*  Where they Henry's just a batterer and then Hill comes in and Hill's been really good for them [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1277.8600000000001s)]
*  I think the Ravens I think they've figured out who they are and I was trying to think of a way they lose this and [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1282.26s)]
*  it's probably just [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1287.66s)]
*  The Bengals chucking it downfield getting a couple of guys one bit [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1289.18s)]
*  Tucker misses a field goal like I see it, but I just think the Ravens are just better [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1293.74s)]
*  Yeah, well, I mean look they the Ravens have the blueprint for stopping Joe burrow [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1298.66s)]
*  He's he's one in three in their last. Yeah four games over the past two years [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1303.8600000000001s)]
*  The Ravens have no problem going into Cincinnati. They're four and two against the spread [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1308.34s)]
*  Lamar James like this. I agree with you Lamar's five and two against the spread in his last seven games in Cincinnati [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1314.6999999999998s)]
*  So it's not like they're right. They know what's at stake [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1321.3799999999999s)]
*  This is really a chance to knock Cincinnati out of the race for the AFC North, right? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1325.2199999999998s)]
*  It's such a good point. Yeah, they're [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1332.78s)]
*  Pittsburgh's three and one Baltimore's two and two [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1335.34s)]
*  Cincy would be one and four if they lost this game [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1338.26s)]
*  And they are you work left. Yeah, you if you're Baltimore you're hoping Pittsburgh somehow loses the Dallas [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1341.18s)]
*  But even if they don't you that's the other thing. It's not like Baltimore's foreign. Oh, like they actually need this game [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1346.94s)]
*  They'd be two and three if they lost [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1352.12s)]
*  I'm in on Baltimore. I was so impressed by them against Buffalo last week. I just thought they looked like bullies [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1354.46s)]
*  I'm fine. I'm going along with it in October [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1359.98s)]
*  I want to see a team that's just like we're bullies we're gonna bully people [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1362.8999999999999s)]
*  I just want to acknowledge how public the play is and that the lines inflated [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1366.06s)]
*  Is it though because I feel like a lot of people are on though [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1371.06s)]
*  Oh, you don't give Joe burrow points at home and I feel like I've been hearing that even on the ringer [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1373.3s)]
*  The ringer gambling show this week. Okay, is the theme you think they're too public? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1378.5s)]
*  Buffalo, I mean Baltimore. Yes, I do [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1383.6999999999998s)]
*  Packers Rams [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1389.6599999999999s)]
*  Speaking of public this is the most public game of the week. Well, and I'm having that in Washington that in Washington [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1391.58s)]
*  Packers minus three against the Rams [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1400.06s)]
*  The Rams should be owned for they should have lost that Niners game [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1403.1s)]
*  They could also be two and two [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1407.8999999999999s)]
*  and at least [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1410.6999999999998s)]
*  They could have beaten Detroit. That was a coin flip game, right? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1412.5s)]
*  They could have I guess I OT they could have beaten Chicago [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1415.98s)]
*  Like that was you know, there was crazy turnover variance there and they they did beat San Francisco. They could be three-and-one [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1420.16s)]
*  Their defense is atrocious [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1428.1200000000001s)]
*  Forget about the receiver injuries 28th against the run [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1430.48s)]
*  31st and quarterback hits 28th in the red zone 29th and completion percentage, which I think is [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1434.48s)]
*  I'm becoming more and more enamored with that scat stat [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1441.04s)]
*  Like if you're just letting somebody throw complete that was Arizona last week against your team. It's just like oh, yeah, please [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1443.96s)]
*  Complete 90% of your passes against us [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1449.96s)]
*  To me the Packers so they're plus 106 to make the playoffs. I [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1453.4s)]
*  Was really surprised that those were plus odds because like oh [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1458.4s)]
*  Let's come up with the seven NFC playoff teams, right you go one from the NFC East right you wouldn't go to [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1464.0s)]
*  Would you say I would stay with one? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1470.96s)]
*  You one in the south or would you go to I think it's reasonable to imagine two out of the south [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1473.36s)]
*  So we'll say one and a half one and a half in the south [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1478.3999999999999s)]
*  two and a half in the north and two in the west [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1481.52s)]
*  Two in the West. Yeah [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1485.8s)]
*  Seattle San Francisco. Yes, I [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1487.48s)]
*  Don't see how the Packers aren't one of the seven best teams [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1491.32s)]
*  Like throw away that stupid Philly game in week one QB gets hurt. They played Minnesota in week four. We haven't seen them [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1494.1599999999999s)]
*  Just in a normal situation. They're gonna be in LA [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1500.88s)]
*  We've 38,000 Packer fans here and their offense is fucking loaded [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1504.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean so multiple receivers they can run the ball Josh Jacobs [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1509.6000000000001s)]
*  We haven't got heard from high fits was big on him this week [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1513.48s)]
*  Craft the tight end has been like kind of a revelation for them [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1516.3200000000002s)]
*  I just think they're gonna move the ball all game in the rims [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1520.0s)]
*  I totally agree my favorite bet by far and I'll just jump right to it is Green Bay over [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1522.5200000000002s)]
*  26 and a half, that's my absolute look jump in load up get on it [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1527.9199999999998s)]
*  But their defense quietly sucks [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1532.84s)]
*  I mean the Vikings jumped out to 28 to nothing [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1535.8s)]
*  That was my best bet on the rigor pregame show this past Sunday, Minnesota [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1539.32s)]
*  Team total it was a ridiculous number [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1545.4399999999998s)]
*  It was like 21 and a half or 20 and a half was like, what are you talking about? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1548.0s)]
*  Where's this line coming from? Why is it so close? [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1551.8s)]
*  Where's this line coming from? Why is this Green Bay defense? That was really good getting that was one of your better ones [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1555.32s)]
*  Thank you for that. Thank you [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1562.1599999999999s)]
*  But I don't know what it is about the the Green Bay defense that has people think that they're gonna be in a position [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1564.1999999999998s)]
*  I think this game is is is perfectly lined up for a shootout kind of game script [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1571.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't think that that that Green Bay defense is gonna put pressure on Stafford and it doesn't matter to the Rams [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1577.08s)]
*  Who the who the receivers are we the guy Whittington is out there running great routes the Marcus Robinson [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1584.1599999999999s)]
*  I think he's dinged up. But if he plays [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1590.3999999999999s)]
*  It just doesn't matter. It's next man up McVeigh and Stafford is the is the key thing there [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1593.24s)]
*  And if if separate has time, he's gonna throw the ball to open receivers [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1598.48s)]
*  So you would rather do Packers over 26 and a half [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1603.24s)]
*  They lay the pack yes, but the Packers minus three, yeah [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1608.48s)]
*  I don't like laying all those points. That's really interesting. I [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1613.84s)]
*  Do think they're gonna be able to score I'm not worried about that part of it [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1618.08s)]
*  Yeah, so if they lose it's like a 30-27 type right right? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1622.56s)]
*  Like that. I think the Rams defense is awful [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1627.24s)]
*  So well, it's you know, 26 and a half. They're all in the hospital. Oh, yeah [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1630.72s)]
*  And the Aaron Donald's [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1636.52s)]
*  Probably watching this going thank God I got out. I'm in a great time [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1639.12s)]
*  All right Packers 26 and a half. I like that house. Thank you trying [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1643.84s)]
*  Saints chiefs [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1650.6799999999998s)]
*  That's a Monday nighter [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1653.8799999999999s)]
*  Saints are getting five and a half points against the Chiefs [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1656.6399999999999s)]
*  and [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1660.1599999999999s)]
*  First of all [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1662.6s)]
*  Casey going five and out with all the shit that's happening them would be incredible [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1664.8s)]
*  Yeah, second New Orleans offense has been really good red zone third downs [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1668.4399999999998s)]
*  You know they had that one one week when Taysom Hill didn't play against Philly. That was just a weird game [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1673.3999999999999s)]
*  Casey's defense is also really good, but New Orleans is defense has been pretty good, too [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1678.2s)]
*  No, Pacheco [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1682.96s)]
*  No, Rishi Rice. No, Hollywood Brown [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1684.6799999999998s)]
*  New left tackle which they tried out last week and this line just seems two and a half points too high to me [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1687.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so the case is you bet on the Saints and the Chiefs are just rushing up the middle and their cars [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1693.4199999999998s)]
*  Discombobulated and you're betting on evil their car. You're betting on dirt car is evil, brother [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1700.62s)]
*  That's the only way I'm covering you also have cheap touchdown potential even if they're down ten [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1705.82s)]
*  But the Chiefs don't take big leads on anybody. No, I know it. I know it feels like a three-point [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1711.62s)]
*  I feel like I'm getting two and a half free points. I like the Saints plus five and a half [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1716.46s)]
*  I think they'll be able to move the ball. I think they'll be gonna be able to move the ball as well [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1719.78s)]
*  I mean want to make sure that you know all of the guys that are dinged on offense are all you know showing out [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1725.74s)]
*  Right on the injury reports and everything [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1732.42s)]
*  but [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1735.18s)]
*  The aspect of it that I'm impressed by I think the Saints defense is legit [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1736.22s)]
*  I think the Saints yeah, especially in this condition that Kansas City finds itself in [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1740.78s)]
*  I [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1746.9s)]
*  I'm probably gonna play the Saints on the money line to be honest with you because I do think that there is a [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1747.9s)]
*  pathway to the Saints, you know taking advantage of the disarray Kansas City's offense is in and [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1754.8200000000002s)]
*  that defense just [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1762.66s)]
*  producing, you know the the win and you're only asking for [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1765.1000000000001s)]
*  Enough out of their car. It doesn't if you look at the the game [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1770.02s)]
*  Totals and of the Chiefs games, it doesn't take a ton to beat them [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1774.2199999999998s)]
*  It doesn't take what you see to beat they've scored less points every week, right? They started at 27 and they've just gone down [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1778.6599999999999s)]
*  to your point Saints the fifth again fifth on [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1785.6599999999999s)]
*  lowest first downs [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1788.9799999999998s)]
*  first in the red zone seven against the rush and [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1790.62s)]
*  You have the Chiefs with they I guess they're punting on Carson Steele and just doing [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1793.82s)]
*  a [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1799.34s)]
*  Lot of Kareem hunt some pea Ryan. We're gonna see yeah, we're gonna see a lot of pea Ryan listen [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1800.38s)]
*  I'm sure the Chiefs are gonna win. They're just gonna win by one or two. It's what they do [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1805.38s)]
*  It's what I want to I want to take the point. So we both like that and then [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1809.1000000000001s)]
*  two other ones so Seattle [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1813.9s)]
*  It's taken on the Giants and Heifetz and I talked about [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1817.0200000000002s)]
*  How important neighbors has been for the Giants 52 targets which is nine higher than everyone else in the league and just over and over again [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1819.98s)]
*  They're just figuring out using I don't think he's gonna play. Yeah [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1826.14s)]
*  He's got a concussion. He didn't practice today [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1829.62s)]
*  Just we're taping this on a Thursday and it seems dicey that is gonna play and even if he plays [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1832.06s)]
*  Sounds like it was a pretty bad concussion [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1836.46s)]
*  Seattle's offense [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1838.82s)]
*  You know, they Gino's been really good. We know they could throw the ball and [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1841.06s)]
*  then the Giants offense even with neighbors was [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1846.1s)]
*  24th and yards per play 30th 30th rushing. Yeah one thing when the Giants this is an interesting stat house [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1850.74s)]
*  Their second worst in completion percentage for their defense [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1857.8799999999999s)]
*  So you just just guys are open all over the field. That sounds great for the Seahawks [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1862.4s)]
*  So I'll give you some options here because I like the Seahawks I think we're taking them somehow [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1868.52s)]
*  We can put them in a tease and try to lose our four tees in five weeks [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1873.92s)]
*  Or we could just bet Seattle first half Seattle for the game minus 140 [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1877.8799999999999s)]
*  And just lay the juice. Hmm. I [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1882.72s)]
*  Kind of prefer the latter I think I prefer to lay the juice [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1885.52s)]
*  Yf around with with the teas. Let's just put it in the hands of Seattle [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1890.48s)]
*  We recognize that the Giants are coming in with extra rest. We recognize [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1894.18s)]
*  Yeah that Seattle is coming on [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1899.2s)]
*  Short rest its own self and we recognize that that was a tough game against Detroit that was you know [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1901.96s)]
*  Explosive on both sides of the ball take all those things into account [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1908.92s)]
*  And that's why we're not gonna ask Seattle the latest six and a half [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1913.1999999999998s)]
*  But come out of the first half with a lead any lead will do and then just win the game [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1916.56s)]
*  Yeah, I like that. I've been trying to get our friends at Fandl. I thought they were our friends. Oh [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1922.4399999999998s)]
*  Oh thought they were our friends. Oh, no, I [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1928.9199999999998s)]
*  Really wanted to do every week to a first half slash game [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1933.28s)]
*  Just a little bit of a boost right this minus 140 just let us every week for all of our friends try to boost that [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1938.5200000000002s)]
*  To like a minus 120. So I'm badgering them [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1944.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm guilt-tripping them and hopefully by next week that could be I want to own my own version of a [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1948.92s)]
*  Parlay for us for million dollar picks where it's like, oh, what's their first half slash game gonna be this week? [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1954.96s)]
*  Like come on, we could come up with a name for that [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1961.48s)]
*  All the good stuff we've done for Fandl they can't they can't give us the first half gamer [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1965.56s)]
*  I want the name. And Sal by the way, they should patent the Sal the Steelers one, you know, that's hitting again this week [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1969.84s)]
*  Oh, I mean, hopefully we get a chance to talk about it. Yeah. Well, so then uh [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1974.88s)]
*  The other one I was looking at for this was Niners first half Niners game is minus 170 [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1981.96s)]
*  You could do the over against the Cardinals bring that down to 40 and a half [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1988.24s)]
*  And all three of those together is minus 101 [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1993.28s)]
*  What were your thoughts because I don't I don't see the the Cardinals their defense and I don't know [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=1996.3999999999999s)]
*  I want to talk myself though Cardinals, you don't give them that many points [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2003.72s)]
*  But I think they have a lot of trouble throwing the ball but kind of I was really surprised last week against Washington [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2006.8s)]
*  He didn't even get did he get to 165 yards? I don't know [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2013.2s)]
*  And Kyler Murray had around 165 yards passing and ran for under five yards [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2017.8s)]
*  I don't know what the game plan was for Arizona going against that [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2023.72s)]
*  I mean literally across the board the Washington defense is in the bottom three of every metric [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2028.6799999999998s)]
*  And for whatever reason Arizona was not able to exploit that and they have great skill guys [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2034.76s)]
*  It makes me nervous though to be honest with you coming into this one where we just watched [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2041.32s)]
*  The San Francisco yes, and San Francisco looks so good against the Patriots [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2048.2799999999997s)]
*  And we would lose if the Cardinals by some dumb [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2053.4s)]
*  Fluke what got the first half like, you know went into halftime up something stupid right like [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2057.48s)]
*  17 16 or something like it's like it's like an IQ test when you play Kyler [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2064.2799999999997s)]
*  If you don't let him get outside, yeah, and you just keep them in the middle [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2069.72s)]
*  It really seems like it's hard for him to move the ball against against decent to good defenses [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2075.36s)]
*  If you let him kind of move around and do stuff [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2080.96s)]
*  Different and the way that I thought Washington did a really good job against him last week [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2083.76s)]
*  Just kind of kept him in the middle of the field and you could see they're really struggling with it. They also [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2088.8s)]
*  You know, it's not important every time you have the ball. Well, that's true. Yes. It does help [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2094.6s)]
*  It does help guys come in. So you want to you want to punt on this Niners game? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2099.34s)]
*  Just because I'm I'm I don't like yeah, I don't I want to punt on it. I want to punt on it [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2103.0400000000004s)]
*  I'll tell you this I was on a couple of Pat's threads [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2108.0800000000004s)]
*  Well, we kind of felt like if they played Drake Drake may we might have either won the game or come close last week [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2112.28s)]
*  Wow, I guess that's a bad reset was he's he's so bad [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2117.6000000000004s)]
*  He's so bad. It's fine. He seems like a great guy like I'm rooting for him. I really want career back up now [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2122.96s)]
*  He's a backup quarterback [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2129.7400000000002s)]
*  It's not his fault. All right, so we'll move on those last one is Steelers Cowboys. It's a night game Steelers minus one and a half [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2131.4s)]
*  Yes [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2138.84s)]
*  Cowboys just lost [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2141.08s)]
*  Just lost what's his face the second receiver? [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2143.28s)]
*  Brandon cooks. Oh, he said he says he's that confirmed out. Yeah, he's out [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2146.88s)]
*  They don't have Lawrence or Parsons on D. They do not two best players. They don't they don't [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2151.7200000000003s)]
*  The Steelers I felt like could have won last week [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2158.08s)]
*  They had the ball down three at like the 35 with three minutes left the snap hit fields in the face for some reason [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2160.6200000000003s)]
*  And then that was it [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2166.36s)]
*  They have some they have offensive line issues. They've now lost two starters named some running back issues [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2167.88s)]
*  but [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2175.1200000000003s)]
*  Steelers minus one and a half [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2177.8s)]
*  Come on. I'm here to tell you [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2179.92s)]
*  In the first place [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2182.6s)]
*  This is a perfect spot for Pittsburgh coming off of a loss of a game that they think they should have won [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2183.78s)]
*  They're at home in prime time with a chance to embarrass one of the other [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2190.4s)]
*  Legendary franchises of the NFL. I'm also here to tell you that Justin Fields Deez nuts [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2198.04s)]
*  is [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2206.0s)]
*  really [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2207.2000000000003s)]
*  Proving and when we talked about Pittsburgh last week [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2208.32s)]
*  I we talked aloud the idea of like, you know, what if Justin Fields starts having some Justin Fields games? [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2211.0800000000004s)]
*  Well, he kind of just had one his decision-making [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2217.32s)]
*  His helmet in the play of the game, of course, of course, that's a Justin Fields Deez nuts play [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2221.1600000000003s)]
*  But I love the way he's using his legs. He's choosing it at the right time [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2227.0800000000004s)]
*  And it's clear that he and Pickens have some chemistry [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2232.56s)]
*  I mean, you know they part of that the loss to the Colts included Pickens fumbling in the effing end zone [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2235.52s)]
*  so I'm I think this number is [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2241.0s)]
*  Crazy short and I adore Pittsburgh every which way [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2244.76s)]
*  TJ watt against poor Dak against that poor offensive line with [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2249.52s)]
*  though the one dimension that Dallas possesses which is [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2254.56s)]
*  They might be able to throw the ball to Ferguson a little bit, but it's just CD. I think that [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2258.2400000000002s)]
*  Pittsburgh's defense will be able to figure it out and even with the injuries on the Pittsburgh offensive line [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2264.6400000000003s)]
*  They still have their slot against some guys. I actually think that they're they're kind of adequate [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2269.28s)]
*  They're not good. But but I didn't know you were an offensive line scout. Now, this is exciting [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2274.28s)]
*  I mean, I have a couple more things for you, too. Let's hear [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2278.54s)]
*  Dallas's offenses 32nd [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2282.92s)]
*  Running. Yes. Nobody is a worse running offense than them through for nobody Pittsburgh's defense is third against the run [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2285.6800000000003s)]
*  So how is Dallas gonna run the ball at all? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2293.02s)]
*  They won't they won't and then on the other side Dallas's defense hasn't been awesome, right? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2296.1s)]
*  28th in the red zone 25th yard per play 27th against the run [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2301.9s)]
*  He's healthy. Yeah, Cora Patterson might play 50 50 [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2306.98s)]
*  but I do think they're gonna be able to run the ball on these guys and [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2312.06s)]
*  To me this feels like a it's a night game. I think this feels like kind of a sad Dallas game [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2316.66s)]
*  My fear would be [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2322.54s)]
*  We've seen Dallas in the situation a few times Pittsburgh big lead early and then Dallas and all of a sudden [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2324.2599999999998s)]
*  That's like the Green Bay Minnesota game where you're like, why am I sweating this out? This game was over [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2329.7s)]
*  So I think there's some weather potential and I you know, it is it is good for outdoors [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2333.7s)]
*  Yes, exactly right and Dallas outdoors hasn't been great either [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2339.7s)]
*  Yeah cousin Sal doesn't like it when I talk about badly about Dallas outdoors [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2342.98s)]
*  But and they did beat the crap out of the Browns in week one, but the weather was perfect for that [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2346.9s)]
*  I think there's some potential for precipitation and if that comes to pass, I especially like this [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2351.46s)]
*  But I already like Pittsburgh every which way in that game. It's one of my favorite bits of the week [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2356.86s)]
*  All right. We have six bets. We really like this week. Wow, we're gonna up this up to 200,000, right? [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2361.9s)]
*  Yeah, this one's a 200,000. I mean if you want to do 250, that's okay by me [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2368.02s)]
*  We're upping it I like I like I like Pittsburgh that much if you want to do some other ones at 200 and one at 150 [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2373.86s)]
*  That's fine. But I'm just telling you Pittsburgh is is probably my favorite bit of the week [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2381.3s)]
*  All right [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2386.0600000000004s)]
*  Well, that brings us to Justin fields these nuts [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2387.82s)]
*  That brings us to the million dollar picks for week five [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2391.7400000000002s)]
*  We are up a hundred ninety seven thousand dollars [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2396.26s)]
*  We deliberately scaled it back last week because we did not like week four [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2398.7000000000003s)]
*  We really like week five and we're gonna bet two hundred thousand dollars on the following games [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2401.84s)]
*  Vikings in London against the Jets we accept all the red flags London game [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2406.3799999999997s)]
*  Vikings 4-0 against the spread a lot of people on the bandwagon by week next week [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2411.7799999999997s)]
*  This is a Vikings defense against [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2417.2999999999997s)]
*  Gimpy Aaron Rodgers not feeling great. This is a really top five coaching staff on Minnesota side versus [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2420.06s)]
*  Big Shot Bob Sal and Hackett [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2426.66s)]
*  This is the Jets not being able to score 10 points against Denver not being able to beat a team [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2429.1s)]
*  That only threw for 60 yards and this feels like a miracle that this line's two and a half [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2434.06s)]
*  I don't get it house. You don't need it. It's I don't either [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2438.98s)]
*  It's just you know, the way the look-ahead worked out, but I love it so much [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2442.46s)]
*  Ravens minus two and a half at Cincinnati. We talked about all the variables with this one [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2447.66s)]
*  Yeah, Ravens are a little public but [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2453.54s)]
*  Best run defense best running game going against the team that can't run the ball or something [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2456.86s)]
*  Against the team that can't run the ball or stop the run [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2462.34s)]
*  We're just gonna settle with those two Ravens wouldn't buy three [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2464.94s)]
*  Are we gonna be sweating this out in the fourth quarter when yes 31 to 14 and then bro hits? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2468.3s)]
*  Jamar chase for 80 yards and and people are two points and yeah, I get Ravens minus two and a half [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2473.6600000000003s)]
*  Packers at the Rams Packers are minus three but house wanted to zag on this little and you know what? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2480.94s)]
*  You've been doing this every week. You've been pretty reliable [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2486.88s)]
*  Even if you did talk me out of the Bears and Raiders last week [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2489.6400000000003s)]
*  Packers over 26 and a half against an absolutely atrocious Rams defense. Yeah [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2495.0s)]
*  we figured they scored 27 and up and [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2501.6s)]
*  Then we don't have to worry about Matthew Stafford getting super hot down the stretch and right or a push any of this [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2505.12s)]
*  No, no weird outcomes exactly, right? [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2510.96s)]
*  Saints plus five and a half at Kansas City [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2514.28s)]
*  Just felt like this lines two and a half points too high. I'm playing the money line. I'm playing Saints Money Line [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2518.12s)]
*  Oh, why didn't you bring that up earlier? I did I said it when we talked about it [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2523.16s)]
*  Would you rather do Saints plus five and a half for Saints Money Line? Oh [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2528.08s)]
*  Thanks, plus five and a half for this for these purposes [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2531.4s)]
*  It says there's a much much smaller wager on the money line for me [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2533.56s)]
*  This feels like another one score game the Chiefs are gonna be the first team ever that wins a game by a half point [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2536.72s)]
*  It's never happened. You can't even calculate points [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2541.56s)]
*  It's like the Chiefs have won 26 and a half to 26 how'd they do that we have no idea [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2544.52s)]
*  This is a three-point game and you also have cheap touchdown potential [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2550.48s)]
*  We take the Saints plus five and a half knowing full well that third quarter Derek cars evil brother Dirk [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2554.68s)]
*  Yeah, just getting his ass. He's gonna be there Jones each other going. Why do we bet on the Saints? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2560.8399999999997s)]
*  All right, here's here's a first half gamer special that [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2567.08s)]
*  Fandle just won't name after me and let me do a boost every week [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2571.6s)]
*  Seattle first half [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2576.08s)]
*  Over the Giants who won't have Malik neighbors were guessing we don't think he will play on Sunday [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2578.2s)]
*  Seattle game that's minus 140 on Fandle. You know what? We're just gonna lay the juice a [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2584.48s)]
*  Great you were sure 80 to win 200. I want a name for it a great first half great game. It's like [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2590.8399999999997s)]
*  Is that is that is that the massage parlay like what's the right name? [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2597.06s)]
*  We gotta come up with a BS massage if you I don't know if you have to bleep that if we have to cut that [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2602.38s)]
*  Out but why does it cut it out? I don't know [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2607.6200000000003s)]
*  That's true massages are fine. Yeah, the first half is your upper back your neck and stuff. We are on your front and then [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2611.1800000000003s)]
*  And then there's the end and it's great [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2619.06s)]
*  The massage parlay the Joe house massage the first half game [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2622.58s)]
*  Yes, minus 140. We're putting 200 on that if we lose we lose 280 thousand dollars [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2627.34s)]
*  We accept those risks and then last but not least first time we've done this [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2632.42s)]
*  You sure you want to do this? We're gonna target an extra [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2637.3s)]
*  Little all right trying to we've done this in five weeks trying to win dealers [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2640.86s)]
*  So we picked every week who have gone three and one for us [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2646.18s)]
*  We are going to take them minus one and a half over the Cowboys for [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2649.12s)]
*  $250,000 of the million dollar picks because [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2656.12s)]
*  Cowboys can't run the ball Steelers love stopping the run [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2659.04s)]
*  Cowboys only have one receiver [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2662.44s)]
*  Cowboys aren't good cowboys are another reason cowboys aren't good this feels to me very similar to that Ravens where they're only [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2666.84s)]
*  Favorit by one and a half going down into Dallas in a must-win scenario these games for Pittsburgh [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2675.12s)]
*  We keep talking about it our must-win games because their schedule is going to get bad bad [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2681.0s)]
*  So they got to go kick-ass when they can and this is a kick-ass spot for them. They're home [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2686.3599999999997s)]
*  It's a game. You should win you go four and one [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2691.3599999999997s)]
*  You hope Baltimore somehow chokes against Cincinnati and you have a two game lead against everyone else division [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2694.3999999999996s)]
*  But Pittsburgh's in a pretty good spot spot for to start the season [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2699.3599999999997s)]
*  So those are Steelers little extra Vikings Ravens Packers over 26 and a half Saints plus five and a half [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2703.72s)]
*  Seattle first half game the massage parlay [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2711.72s)]

*  Who's that who the hell you're talking about all right see you next week see you next week [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9EcI633C0&t=2730.32s)]
