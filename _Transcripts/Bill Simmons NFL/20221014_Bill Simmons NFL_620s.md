# The End of a Quarterback Era | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [October 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdfHUG9U30g)
*  thinking big picture, is this feeling like the little bit of the end of an era?
*  And I don't even know what era it is, but we have the end of Brady.
*  We have the end of Rogers, Matt Ryan's of freaking zombie at this point.
*  Uh, Matt Stafford might be headed that way.
*  And then Wilson, everybody is just, uh, buried alive.
*  I don't even know what happened to him.
*  And then Rathausberger, I mailed you the passing leaders from 2016.
*  And it was basically all those guys with Rathausberger and Breeze.
*  And now we have this new generation.
*  But I never really thought of like the whole, oh, this actually 2022
*  might be the end of something.
*  What do you think about that?
*  Yeah, I think that you have two separate things going on, right?
*  Uh, the change of like the aging cliff in old quarterbacks has been really
*  interesting, right?
*  And the, uh, Brian Burk for ESPN wrote a piece that apparently has lost the time.
*  I couldn't find it.
*  Like the URL is dead and whatever about how, uh, when quarterbacks age, they
*  get a little bit worse, a little bit worse, a little bit worse, and it's generally
*  fine and then one year they're terrible.
*  Right.
*  It's important to understand aging and quarterbacks as a cliff.
*  We don't really see gradual declines.
*  And that explains what you've seen from guys like Brady and Rogers over
*  the last five, six years, right?
*  There was that time where we were like, yeah, Rogers is done.
*  Like it's clearly finished.
*  Like he's not the guy he was.
*  And then all of a sudden he went back to back MVP's Brady's final season in
*  new England, it was he's, he's off.
*  He's fallen off the cliff.
*  It's done.
*  He can't do what he did.
*  And then he goes and he wins the Superbowl with Tampa, right?
*  Like there you, you have these downturns, but generally it's more noise.
*  It's variance until all of a sudden there's one year where everything collapses.
*  Typically that aging cliff we've seen be in the mid to late thirties.
*  That's not the rules anymore.
*  Right.
*  We, quarterbacks are able to play for longer.
*  Certainly Brady's pushing that horizon, but also a guy like Rogers looks like
*  he might Ryan is trying to at 38, but Ryan's falling off.
*  They're trying to get into their late thirties and even into their forties.
*  So number one, you're seeing the aging cliff for quarterbacks.
*  I think start to move a little bit further down the line to get into later seasons.
*  Some of that's being smart about taking hits, advanced in sports science, whatever.
*  The other thing that ushers in a change of the guard of the quarterback position
*  is when the young guys are really good.
*  That's just by default, right?
*  The alternatives are better.
*  Number one, we're a lot better at getting young quarterbacks.
*  Good.
*  The whole, you know, advancements in quarterback development have changed
*  drastically to the point where you don't need to sit a guy for three Aaron
*  Rogers years to make sure he feels good.
*  You can get them out there and you can start to produce.
*  We have these offenses, right?
*  Eagles with Jalen hurts Niners and Rams with, with golf and Garoppolo,
*  just kind of point and shoot a guy.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  We can, we can work around them.
*  But then also we hit on a few classes and in the 2010s, we weren't hitting.
*  We were not getting consistent, good quarterbacks out of the draft year over year.
*  We'd have one guy here and one guy there and Russell Wilson in the third round.
*  We kind of, you know, 2013 class was weird, but we didn't have years like we had
*  with 2017, 2018, 2019, where Mahomes Watson, certainly for his rookie contract,
*  you haven't seen him yet kind of posted suspension and post his injury and his
*  holdout, but Mahomes Watson, 2018 Lamar Allen, and then 2019, uh, burrow and
*  Herbert, right?
*  We didn't get that run of dudes.
*  And once you get that run of guys, they start pushing the old dudes out just by
*  virtue of how they play the ceiling of quarterback play raises and the mid tier
*  veterans feel like they're falling off.
*  And we lost Andrew Luck.
*  Yes.
*  Who should be like either in his prime or at his absolute peak or close to
*  his, he should be the bridge.
*  He should be the connection between the over 35s and the under 26s.
*  He'd be the guy in the middle.
*  And we kind of lost Wilson, which is weird because I would've thought Wilson
*  would have aged really well, but I don't, I don't know.
*  Why, why do you think so?
*  Cause he was so to me, it was like a breeze thing, right?
*  Breeze was smaller, but he was so accurate and he could move around a little bit.
*  But as he got older, the accuracy stayed.
*  And I just assumed it would be something like that, where it'd be like a short,
*  you know, short yardage passing offense and just, he would just be able to 70% a
*  year, right?
*  Veterans savvy.
*  And that didn't happen.
*  It's such an important comparison for Russ specifically because Breeze is what
*  he's trying to be now.
*  Breeze is what he wants to be.
*  Right.
*  Steven Ruiz, the ringer and I have the joke about Russ's performative checkdowns
*  where he's constantly like dumping the ball off to Javante Williams and Melvin
*  Gordon and the running backs, the tight ends.
*  And you watch the film and downfield, Kaiser Hamler is like one on one with a
*  step and old Russ was throwing that ball.
*  And for some reason he's just underneath, underneath, underneath.
*  And it's because I think he knows that physically he can't be the scrambler he
*  was physically.
*  He's not the tackle breaker.
*  He was you look at Russ's scramble numbers in terms of how many yards he picks
*  up, how often he gets the first down and also his sack avoidance numbers.
*  The percentage of pressures that Russ takes that turn into a sack have catapulted
*  it skyrocketed the last two or three seasons.
*  So as the athleticism goes down, he knows that if he's going to have a late career
*  Renaissance, if he's going to be good in his thirties, it will be in the Breeze
*  model.
*  Yes, I'm short, but I'm accurate.
*  The ball's out quick and I'm distributing.
*  He just has never, ever been that quarterback previously.
*  Previously, he was run around, scramble, hold the ball for five seconds, deep
*  moonshot.
*  And he doesn't physically feel like he can do that anymore.
*  So we're watching a quarterback try to change his play style, which is literally a
*  tiger changing his stripes.
*  It doesn't happen.
*  And that's what Russ is trying to do.
*  Square pegging around hole in Denver.
*  And that's why you're experiencing such discontent, such toughness in this
*  offense right now.
*  Russ is trying to play a brand of football he's never played before.
*  It's funny that Brady belongs to basically two different generations, right?
*  Cause he's definitely in this Rogers, Wilson, Ryan, that whole generation, which
*  was the 2010s class basically.
*  But he was also in that previous generation with Peyton Manning and Rivers
*  and all those guys too.
*  And you talked about how there was a little bit of a drought, right?
*  You go back to oh six where it was the first just first rounders, Vince young
*  liner, Cutler.
*  That was supposed to be, you were only two years old that year.
*  That was supposed to be an awesome QB draft.
*  We're like, wow, three stars coming in.
*  Well, this is when everybody was West coast offense pills, right?
*  We all watched Manning and Brady and Breeze and Rivers.
*  And we said, this is what often is going to be forever.
*  Five in the concept short passing game.
*  Let's all just get a tall white who looks nice in the pocket and a smart on
*  the chalkboard.
*  And it turns out there's like one of those every three years and you can't
*  build the house around that.
*  And so that's what you see all these, these first round picks busted out.
*  Cutler kind of made it.
*  I mean, he did get traded for two first round picks at some point.
*  He had a decent career.
*  He wasn't a bus.
*  The other two were bus the next year.
*  Oh seven, Jermarcus Russell, Brady Quinn, the next year, Matt Ryan, Joe
*  Flacco, which counts as like an absolute boon compared to some of these other
*  names, Oh nine Stafford Sanchez, Josh Freeman, all in the top 17 2010, Sam
*  Bradford, Tebow crossed that year off.
*  2011 cam Newton, Jake locker, Blaine Gabbard, Christian Ponder all in the top
*  12.
*  So cam makes it, we go one for four in 12.
*  There's another QB year.
*  Luck Griffin, Tannahill Weeden.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's the, that's the fulls Russ here if memory serves as well.
*  So that was the year where like the third round just randomly hit.
*  Right.
*  But even the after 2012 was like luck and Griffin.
*  This is great.
*  These guys are really good.
*  And Griffin's out of the league pretty shortly after starting.
*  His Tannahill out of that whole round one, 2013 Texas A and M incredible.
*  2013, ZJ manual 14 is Bortles, Manziel and Bridgewater 2013.
*  Also has Gino.
*  Don't you forget round two stud, Gino Smith.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm just giving you the round ones.
*  15 was Winston and, and, uh, Mariotta and then 16 was goth, Wentz and Lynch.
*  So when you talk about like a drought, it's actually kind of impossible that
*  we had 11 years there in a row with how few franchise guys we got out of that.
*  And then probably the best guy I listed at all those dudes was Andrew luck who
*  retires when he's what 27, 28.
*  So then this happens in the NBA sometimes where the NBA kind of ebbs and flows,
*  depending on, you know, drafts.
*  And we were in this draft boom right now.
*  We're year after year.
*  We've just had these awesome drafts from like 2017 on.
*  And now the league, you can really feel it.
*  There's all these all stars and franchise guys.
*  But then there was other stretches where we didn't have it.
*  And I think with the NFL, it does feel like this is a new quarterback era,
*  starting with that 17 drafts where we're just going to be like, wow, look
*  at all those dudes we got.
*  This is amazing.
*  We got like 10 guys who can run a team versus that before.
*  So anyway, I think that's, that's why it feels like an end of a generation,
*  but there's no next generation that I guess luck and Wilson would have been
*  leading and didn't happen.
*  Now, the final important note on that 2017 turn is that you saw a lot of the
*  players that get selected from 2017 on gets selected to AFC teams.
*  And the reason we saw that was because they knew the Brady dusk was coming.
*  They knew that Brady was either going to retire or just leave New England in
*  some way, right?
*  The rumors were starting.
*  He was reaching that age.
*  And so there became it like, you know, you go back and you look at who was
*  making the AFC championship games, right?
*  Over like 2004, 2017, Brady, Brady, Brady, Rothenberger, Brady, Manning,
*  Brady, Rothenberger, Manning, Brady, Rothenberger, Manning, Manning.
*  There was just this, this top cap on the AFC where nobody could get past
*  this unit of quarterbacks and Rothenberger has fallen off.
*  Manning's out of the league and we see the Brady fall off coming.
*  And all of a sudden Miami's on Tua.
*  The charges are on Herbert.
*  Cincinnati's on Borough.
*  The Bravens are on Lamar.
*  The Bills are on, on, on Allen.
*  And then that's just the good ones.
*  Like the Browns went for Baker.
*  The Jets went for Sam, right?
*  Everybody is going for a young quarterback ready to develop that guy.
*  Ready to, they, they put new resources in, they have new knowledge of how do we get
*  a young quarterback to be better because everybody wants to be positioned for
*  the moment the Brady hammer drops.
*  We have our young guy, we're on a rookie contract, let's go.
*  And so that, a big part of the drought ending was half of the lead, the AFC
*  deciding, okay, we are going to figure out how to develop a rookie quarterback, how
*  to get him on the field and win with him.
*  Cause if we can get a rookie contract quarterback ready and we have the
*  advantage of the extra money and he's, he's, he's contending, he's successful.
*  The moment Brady leaves, we can finally shoot.
*  We can finally go and actually push here in the AFC and get back on top when this
*  guy's just been sitting there for so long.
