*  Guest alliance.
*  Week nine, before we do guest alliance,
*  here's the playoff picture.
*  Six-win teams, Detroit, Green Bay, Washington.
*  Phillies five and two, Atlantis five and three.
*  But then, Chicago's four and three,
*  Seattle, Tampa, Arizona, San Francisco, all four and four.
*  So the AMC is like, we're not gonna know what happens
*  for two more months.
*  No.
*  AFC, KC seven and oh, Buffalo and Houston six and two,
*  Pittsburgh's five and two, Baltimore's five and three.
*  That's five teams.
*  Then you have the Chargers in Denver.
*  Denver's five and three, the Chargers are four and three.
*  Indy's four and four.
*  There's gonna be an awful AFC playoff team.
*  Yeah, I think so. I think it's official.
*  Yeah, we're gonna be, like, we might be able to bet
*  against Bo Nix in a playoff game.
*  Denver is, well, that's kinda how I felt
*  about Chicago and Washington.
*  And fans of both cities will be mad,
*  but I was like, look at my chops.
*  I felt like, oh man, who was salivating more?
*  Me, knowing I could bet one of these teams in the playoffs,
*  or the two seed that is actually gonna play this team
*  in the playoffs.
*  But yeah, Denver doesn't seem ready to me just yet.
*  I know they beat up on the Panthers.
*  It gets a little rough for them coming up.
*  But they're overrun.
*  There was five and a half.
*  They're at five already.
*  Like, that could be Buffalo hosting Denver
*  as like 10 and a half point favorites, right?
*  Yeah, that'd be a fun one.
*  MVP, Josh Allen is the favorite on FandO at plus 320.
*  Lamar is plus 350.
*  Mahomes is plus 450.
*  Goff is 71 and Daniels is nine to one.
*  And I don't think anyone else
*  is really in the mix at this point.
*  I still like Goff here.
*  I'm still going Goff.
*  I know they, I mean, they scored a billion points,
*  and he didn't contribute accordingly,
*  like a guy who would score that many points.
*  But his numbers, what did he do?
*  In the last four games, he has 13 incompletions,
*  and they have 23 touchdowns.
*  Like, you show that stat to the Panthers coach,
*  and he's like, what?
*  What league is that?
*  Can I get in that league?
*  That's ridiculous numbers.
*  He's like, can I get in any league?
*  Yeah.
*  Dave Canales, who fake punted from,
*  did you see that one today?
*  I did, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  The desperation fake punt on a bad team that goes terribly
*  is the announcer never knows what to do.
*  Right.
*  The answer's like, oh boy!
*  Just when you thought it couldn't get worse
*  for the Panthers, it's like one of those.
*  They're just like so bummed out.
*  The announcers of the Panthers Broncos games
*  might not know what to do anyway,
*  but just because they're putting that slot.
*  But yeah, there was some, Antonio Pierce.
*  It's Chris Myers, let's just say who it is.
*  It actually wasn't, it was down, whatever.
*  Chris Myers says, I'm right here!
*  Hey!
*  Yeah, but Pierce not kicking that field goal on fourth,
*  I don't know if you wanna talk about it real quick,
*  but against the Chiefs, I think he kinda cut it to four.
*  And then, I mean, they had first and goal at the one.
*  It was like fourth and goal from the three.
*  Like, what do you need to see?
*  Your team's going backwards.
*  Bring the field goal,
*  and that was when you bring the field goal kicker out.
*  Pierce's field goal decisions this year
*  have been one of the secret joys
*  of YouTube TV's multiview.
*  It's either Jayden Davis is Hail Mary,
*  or Pierce kicking the field goal
*  to cut it from eight to five last week.
*  That were my two favorite moments of the year.
*  That was the best.
*  And it's still a one touchdown game.
*  I have to say, I think Alan at plus 320,
*  even though he's the favorite,
*  is probably the one I would bet
*  if I had to bet any of those.
*  Yeah, because if they're a one or a two seed,
*  he's gonna be the reason, right?
*  There's no other reason.
*  He's excellent,
*  and I feel like they have eight pass catchers now.
*  He finally threw an interception.
*  He had nine games in a row without a pick.
*  Still cool.
*  All right, Guest Alliance, week nine.
*  Somehow the Jets are playing on Thursday night.
*  I feel like this team has been on national TV.
*  The only bigger nightmare than being a Jets fan
*  is being, everyone else who likes watching night games
*  on television,
*  because we have to fucking watch this team again.
*  Yeah, they didn't,
*  the schedule makers got bored or something.
*  They put the Jets, the Steelers, and the Giants
*  in some kind of like bingo hopper,
*  and they just kept going,
*  like, all right, well, just you play Thursday,
*  and you play here,
*  and then you'll play each other six times,
*  and we'll have you against the Texans on Halloween.
*  Well, this is in New York,
*  or I guess in New Jersey,
*  which I don't know if that helps the Jets.
*  I think people will be surly.
*  I think alcohol will be served and consumed,
*  and I don't think it's gonna be a happy sporting event
*  to go to.
*  The good news for the Jets is that the Texans
*  are down to one receiver.
*  From what I saw today,
*  I think they could probably run the ball,
*  with the ball in them,
*  but I have the Texans as favorites.
*  I have the Texans favored by one and a half
*  at the New York Jets.
*  All right, here's what infuriates me.
*  The Texans are a lot better than the Jets,
*  and I'm not just saying,
*  because one team's six and two,
*  and the other's two and six.
*  So I also had the Texans favored,
*  but by three,
*  and I thought it was a little light.
*  The Jets are favored by one and a half.
*  Oh, wow.
*  The Jets are favored by one and a half.
*  What do you need to see out of the Jets anymore?
*  Well, what you saw today was the team that's...
*  Yeah, they seem like they wanted the season end,
*  except for a couple guys.
*  Can they play a capable quarterback and survive?
*  I don't like this line.
*  This makes me wanna skip the week,
*  because I'm not gonna do well the rest of the games
*  if I can't hit this.
*  Where do you think this line ends?
*  Well, maybe it'll flip.
*  We've seen one and a half slip the other way,
*  but, oh no, the Texans are favored by one.
*  Jets are favored by one.
*  Yeah, it would have to flip to the Texans.
*  Oh, I'm sorry, it did flip already.
*  I'm sorry, it did flip.
*  The Texans are one and a half.
*  When I wrote it down an hour ago,
*  it was Jets one and a half.
*  That's what I picked, so I hit that exactly.
*  You got it exactly.
*  All right, I was just insulted
*  that the Jets at one point was favored.
*  It's like, you got it exactly.
*  I feel like you're on the Jets with the...
*  I did that first one. You got it anyway.
*  Yeah.
*  Sunday marquee game is great.
*  Lions at Green Bay.
*  Sadly, we don't know if Jordan Love,
*  what his status is gonna be.
*  I just picked it like he's gonna play,
*  because I assume he's gonna play the Lions by three.
*  Well, so you think Jordan Love,
*  with Jordan Love, the Lions,
*  but what are you gonna, you get it anyway.
*  It's three and a half.
*  Okay.
*  But I thought Green Bay would be a one point favor
*  with Jordan Love.
*  I'm so off today.
*  So off.
*  I have three watchable games,
*  and the first one is your team,
*  because it's Falcons, Cowboys.
*  You kinda need the game.
*  Yep.
*  I'll go this far.
*  I kinda like watching Atlanta.
*  You do?
*  I think they're a fun hang every week.
*  Yeah, I enjoy watching their team.
*  I like their offense, their defense.
*  They can't rush the passer,
*  so the other offense is always good.
*  Their games are fun to watch.
*  I have the Falcons minus three over the Cowboys.
*  I think you can throw on them.
*  I think you could actually potentially beat them.
*  All right, I'm gonna get this one.
*  I said Falcons by one, and it's one and a half,
*  but it probably will move up to a number you have.
*  Yeah, it depends what version you're getting, right?
*  If Cousins is in sync, and Kyle Pitts is alive,
*  and Mooney and all those guys are clicking on offense,
*  great, so they're fun to watch.
*  But if it's 17-15, and they're trotting Coup out
*  to kick a 54 yard, or that means something or doesn't,
*  I hate that version.
*  Bears are the second rewatchable game.
*  They are at Arizona.
*  This game will be, I think, interesting and compelling.
*  And I have the Bears favored by one.
*  Ooh, all right, I get this.
*  I had Arizona by two, and it's Arizona by one and a half.
*  Don't agree.
*  Don't a lot of people from Chicago live in Arizona?
*  Isn't that the transplant?
*  Like, McWan?
*  Is it, yeah, C is one, yeah.
*  I think there's a lot, like that's the actual migration.
*  Like it's a little closer to Illinois
*  to just like zoom down there.
*  Yeah, I don't know what the point is, but.
*  Well, yeah, I mean, if you had the two residents saying,
*  hey, you balance it, you gotta get out of Arizona
*  in the summer in Chicago,
*  that's the most fun time to be in Chicago.
*  Right, a lot of Bears fans say that's what I'm saying.
*  Well, didn't they used to be,
*  they were the Chicago Cardinals, right?
*  Cardinals.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  They moved from Chicago to Arizona.
*  Right, right.
*  Before our time, please, let's.
*  Way before our time.
*  You know, there's something on, and speaking of Chicago,
*  there's something on Instagram
*  of all of Walter Payton's touchdown throws.
*  Really?
*  He was by far the best non QB thrower
*  of anyone who did that.
*  And I was thinking like, I still have him number one
*  for any running back I've ever seen, Walter Payton.
*  And we didn't even get to see him that much in New England.
*  I mean, it was only like every once in a while,
*  but we'd see the clips.
*  But I just thought like he was the best at everything.
*  I don't know if there's been anyone like him since.
*  He was dazzling.
*  They say Jim Brown before him.
*  But yeah, he could do it all.
*  You know what?
*  And as a quarterback too,
*  let's go back to your list of who's better than Rogers.
*  Would you take Walter Payton?
*  Would you rather have Walter Payton or Roger?
*  Right now.
*  Walter Payton or Rogers?
*  Forget 78, right now I would take Walter Payton.
*  He was so good.
*  Who's your number one?
*  Would you say Emmett just out of loyalty?
*  Well, I would, but I mean, what are we saying?
*  Because like, best hang, best to watch is Barry Sanders.
*  There's no doubt.
*  Yeah, but if I'm trying to win games
*  and win the Super Bowl.
*  Emmett closed the line.
*  I would take Emmett if I had a whole season,
*  absolutely Walter Payton.
*  But I thought Emmett for one game
*  with a decent offensive line was getting you 155 yards.
*  And he was gonna move the chains 11 times.
*  We'll probably forget names like Dickerson
*  and guys like that.
*  But I even put like Terrell Davis pretty high
*  in terms of like putting the game in the right.
*  So that's the other one for me.
*  Cause it was a short prime,
*  but that those two years where it just seemed like
*  he could run 45 degrees and go six yards a thing.
*  He'd be the other one for me.
*  And the 21st century guys,
*  I don't know, a lot of people would have Tomlinson here
*  and I just never, he never quite got there for me.
*  As good as he was better in fantasy than real life.
*  Peterson, I don't know.
*  Last one for the watchable, Seahawks Rams.
*  It's in Seattle.
*  And I have the Seahawks by two and a half over the Rams.
*  That's exactly what I had.
*  It's one and a half though.
*  It's three, three.
*  Very watchable.
*  I have some real losers in here though.
*  Go ahead.
*  I did something today
*  cause we had the eight early games today by the way.
*  I did the multi view for the big TV.
*  I put Green Bay Jacksonville on its own TV on the side.
*  And then I had the other three games,
*  Browns, Miami and Buffalo.
*  I had them on a three team multi view,
*  but I kept clicking.
*  That was the one I was controlling with my finger
*  like on the remote.
*  Kind of kept on the Browns,
*  but if it was a commercial, we'd zoom back for all three.
*  I watched eight games at the same time.
*  I was really proud of myself.
*  What a world this is, right?
*  Yeah, so did I.
*  And you didn't mention Red Zone once.
*  You don't need it.
*  Watch the games.
*  Listen, those are Red Zones for the kids.
*  They're giving us the games.
*  For people like my son.
*  Yeah, I wanna watch the actual game.
*  They're putting Flamin' Yon in front of us.
*  Why are we grabbing the mashed potatoes?
*  Come on.
*  Fairly watchables.
*  Buffalo is home for the Miami Dolphins.
*  And I think this goes right into the Vegas Zone
*  and it spills by five.
*  That's what I said.
*  It's six and a half.
*  Ooh, out of the Vegas Zone.
*  Well, they beat him 31-10 week two, right?
*  Yeah, they killed them.
*  Yeah.
*  If I'm playing the Dolphins after watching that game,
*  I'm playing everybody tight
*  and I'm making to it,
*  try to hold the ball for two seconds
*  because I think he's under direction not to.
*  Right.
*  Brown's home for the Chargers.
*  And you could have argued this should have been a watchable.
*  I have the Browns favored by one and a half.
*  Oh, I got this right.
*  I had Chargers by two.
*  It's Chargers by two and a half.
*  That's stupid.
*  I don't agree with that.
*  I don't even like this Chargers team.
*  I don't know.
*  So you had that game on a multi-view?
*  Oh no, that was the late afternoon.
*  That was a later game.
*  I watched that game.
*  I look at that, I'm like,
*  I feel bad for everyone who has to sit in traffic
*  because they bought tickets to Saints Chargers.
*  Disgusting.
*  I'm on some threads about,
*  you know, there are 10 receivers picked in the first 37.
*  Harrison,
*  Neighbors, Dunzey.
*  The Pats had the 34th pick in the second round.
*  Brian Thomas went 23rd.
*  Casey traded up for Xavier Worthy at 28.
*  You want lead.
*  So five guys I really like.
*  Ricky Pearsall, 31, looked good tonight.
*  Ligette on Carolina, he's at least done a couple things.
*  Keon Coleman, I think, has been good on Buffalo, 33.
*  We had the 34th pick.
*  Traded back with the Chargers.
*  They took Lad McConkey, 34th.
*  We took Jalen Polk, 37th, who I think has the worst stats
*  of any receiver who's had over like 10 targets this season.
*  Somehow the Pats have done it again
*  with second round receivers.
*  I don't know how we do it.
*  How many?
*  Not crossing them off, but I'm just saying,
*  I was thinking about it as Lad McConkey
*  was like the star of the Chargers game.
*  No doubt.
*  Did you cross them off your fantasy teams?
*  He was on at least two of your fantasy teams, Jalen Polk.
*  Not anymore, he was waived a long time ago.
*  Yeah, so we traded, we had the 34th pick.
*  We traded back for the 110th pick.
*  Traded back three spots and went from 137 to 110.
*  So they moved the 27 spots to not have Lad McConkey,
*  who just seems like he gets open
*  and makes big plays all the time.
*  This trading stuff used to work out for you all the time.
*  It catches it all, like everyone else on the Patriots.
*  Washington is at the Giants.
*  I couldn't go higher than four in this.
*  I have Washington by four.
*  You get it.
*  I said two and it's three and a half.
*  I don't know why I said two, that was dumb.
*  It's five, five.
*  Ravens home for the Broncos.
*  This was 21, 18, right?
*  Who won this?
*  Washington won the first time, 21, 18.
*  Well, that was the one where they didn't have
*  the backup kicker.
*  That's right.
*  And then couldn't, they had to go for it when, yeah.
*  Yeah, Washington didn't score touchdown, yeah.
*  Ravens Broncos, I'm putting the Broncos right away
*  on Moneyline underdog alert because.
*  Oh wow.
*  After a loss?
*  Huh?
*  After a Ravens loss?
*  No, I'm not betting it, I'm just saying.
*  Like that Ravens.
*  Ravens at home, minus seven against Denver.
*  And the reason you have to do the, that's my pick.
*  But the reason I have them on alert is,
*  it just seems like when the Ravens play a shitty team,
*  they just decide to play shitty.
*  Or like a mediocre team, like they rise to the occasion
*  and get some good teams.
*  And a game like this, they're like, ah, Bo Nicks,
*  he can't throw the ball.
*  And they think they'll just show up.
*  And then, you know, all of a sudden it's 14 to 12
*  with four minutes left.
*  I could see that.
*  I said five and a half, but Fandl disagrees with both of us.
*  They say this is gonna be a shellacking.
*  Eight and a half they went with, so you win.
*  You know, Fandl, I say this out of love,
*  and it's a compliment because Fandl's been great to us
*  and they're an awesome partner and I like Fandl.
*  They rebranded those RSNs.
*  They did, yeah.
*  And I was watching the Warriors Quippers game tonight
*  and it said like the Fandl Sports Network.
*  It was kind of cool.
*  It was actually like, it seemed like pretty smart
*  that they got all those RSNs.
*  It's just like automatic promotion.
*  All your boosts popped up.
*  Did you see your boosts promoted on that?
*  No, that sounds great.
*  Yeah, you're not getting paid for that?
*  No, I didn't see it.
*  I didn't see it.
*  I didn't see it.
*  They should, they should though, why not?
*  I just like Fandl Sports Network
*  so much more than Ballis,
*  whatever the fuck Ballis was.
*  All right, last one for semi-watchables.
*  Eagles, Jaguars, and Philly.
*  Doug, did we lose Coach Middlesay tomorrow?
*  This week, you mean?
*  What do you mean?
*  Well, tomorrow's when they fire coaches.
*  Oh, I see.
*  Yeah, you're right, you're right.
*  Oh man, I would have pulled the plug three times.
*  By the way, this was flexed out of the night game, right?
*  That's how much they hate Middlesay.
*  Yeah.
*  This is now a late afternoon game.
*  I think this is it for him.
*  He doesn't leave Philly.
*  They give him a cheesesteak and a bus pass, and that's that.
*  We'll always have him and Nick Foles
*  somehow beating the Patriots and Belichick and Brady.
*  We'll go down 40 years from now,
*  people will just be staring at the box score going,
*  wait, what happened?
*  That kills you.
*  That's top three for you, worst.
*  I think if you, there's probably too many Yankees shit
*  in there.
*  The worst ones are the two Giants ones
*  were worse than the Eagles ones.
*  Yeah, all right.
*  Yeah, so this doesn't crack the five, I don't think.
*  The first Giants one, they played better than us.
*  I know we were supposed to win,
*  but that team was running on fumes,
*  and the Giants played great that game.
*  They beat the shit out of us, they deserved to win.
*  The second one was bullshit.
*  I don't know how we didn't win that game.
*  They really, that was, that second Giants team
*  has to be one of the worst Super Bowl champs ever.
*  I have no idea how we lost to that game.
*  Gronk was hurt.
*  I lost a lot of them.
*  You watched that, I actually watched that game
*  two summers ago, and I was just like,
*  how the fuck did we lose this game?
*  Yeah.
*  Eagles, Jags, I have Eagles minus six.
*  You're closer, I said five and a half, it's seven.
*  Can we urge America not to tease the Eagles?
*  You won't do Eagles, what team do we keep?
*  Keep the Eagles at you, dirty mouth.
*  No, don't trust the Eagles.
*  You don't think they're back on track?
*  Don't trust the Eagles.
*  That's true.
*  You did warn us, because when you said
*  Sirianni's got that swagger,
*  and then it goes the other way, right?
*  Yeah, don't trust them.
*  Yeah, okay.
*  Poop Factor, two games.
*  The Bengals are home for the Raiders.
*  The Raiders are officially unwatchable.
*  And yet, I don't know how the Bengals can be favored
*  by more than seven, seven and a half.
*  So I went seven, I didn't feel good about that.
*  They're good, this is where you pull away.
*  I said six.
*  I didn't even think they were that strong.
*  Eight and a half is the number.
*  Oh, that's stupid.
*  Jesus, they stink.
*  I mean, talk about no pass rush, no pressure or anything.
*  Holy shit, Hertz has to feel like,
*  he probably didn't even get touched in that game.
*  No, I know, he was push pushing from the three yard line.
*  He didn't even care.
*  We saw Desmond Ritter come in for a play, for one play.
*  And I was like, oh, and then we went, oh, where's he going?
*  What happened?
*  Not that we haven't seen enough of him.
*  Did we have a nickname for Desmond Ritter?
*  Did we?
*  What did we have?
*  Middle seat Des?
*  No.
*  It feels like something you would have come up with.
*  Other Poop Factor game.
*  Titans are home for the Patriots.
*  And this is a 1.5, if I've ever seen it.
*  Titans by 1.5 over the Pats.
*  That's what I said.
*  I tried to think about it and I gave up.
*  And so I went to the go to 1.5.
*  It is three.
*  The Titans are a three point favorite.
*  They're terrible, Jesus.
*  They're awful.
*  Talk about, to go from Mike Freyball to the coaching,
*  I don't know Mike Freyball.
*  I thought we're friends.
*  I couldn't believe they fired him.
*  Thought he was a really good coach.
*  They have this team now that just gets torched
*  on special teams.
*  They just give away games.
*  They gave away that Bears game week one.
*  They did two, three stupid things every week.
*  I agree.
*  They had Mike Freyball.
*  The stupid, I don't know what happened
*  on the Ring of Pre-Games show today
*  because these guys laughed at me
*  when I made the Bills my best bet
*  last week against the Titans.
*  And it took them a minute to get rolling.
*  And then this week they're like,
*  all right, which big favorite loses?
*  It's Detroit, right?
*  I'm like, no way.
*  This team, they can't get out of there.
*  They're scoring in bunches here.
*  It's like a college game.
*  Well, we're not done with the Poop Factor.
*  We have our own category.
*  One, two, three, four, five.
*  I wrote down seven O's.
*  It's the Poop Factor.
*  Saints at Panthers.
*  Holy moly, will I not watch one minute of this game.
*  You couldn't, you couldn't,
*  you could bring in TVs
*  and I would throw them against the wall
*  over watching this.
*  They toss you 10 iPads.
*  The Apple Store brings them to your house.
*  No, not putting them on.
*  My goal next week is to not watch
*  a single play from this game.
*  Unless it's cut into a game I'm watching.
*  They're like, let's go to Carolina.
*  Well, we already saw it.
*  There was a 47-10 in the original.
*  Right.
*  When we were talking about the Saints with the 99 Rams.
*  No, they've lost six straight.
*  I have Saints minus three.
*  Okay, this floored me.
*  And you get it again.
*  I think you won the week at this point, yeah.
*  I said two and a half.
*  It's six and a half.
*  Well, this is, Raheem said this
*  on the Sunday pregame show today,
*  which is excellent.
*  You should watch it on YouTube TV every week
*  because it sells on it.
*  Thanks.
*  11 o'clock on Sundays, YouTube TV,
*  put it in your library on YouTube TV.
*  YouTube TV, great product.
*  And then it's right there.
*  And Raheem was like, his model had them, what,
*  16 points behind every other team.
*  Right, yeah.
*  Minus 16 or something.
*  Which is like, kind of being born out
*  week to week to week where they're just getting slaughtered.
*  Yeah, maybe that's why.
*  Six and a half, I guess Carr is coming back.
*  Oh, they're just so bad.
*  They're just so bad.
*  They lost 28-14 to Denver.
*  Yeah, I guess it makes sense.
*  Sunday night, Vikings Colts in Minnesota.
*  Flexed.
*  I don't know how you start Richardson in this game.
*  With the way the Vikings and Flores,
*  I don't, I just, you have to start Flacco,
*  but I think they're just kind of pot committed
*  to Richardson at this point.
*  I have Vikings by four and a half.
*  Ooh, I thought with that explanation,
*  you're gonna go higher.
*  I went five and a half, it's six and a half.
*  Hmm, let me count.
*  There's no way, right?
*  Four, five, six, seven, two, three, four, five,
*  six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
*  No, fuck that.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you'll put that in a teaser.
*  I mean, the Vikings coming off a loss on extended rest.
*  You love that.
*  If Flacco plays, I'm betting the Colts.
*  Wow.
*  I think the Colts have been playing pretty well.
*  Their quarterbacks really hurt them,
*  but I think their defenses look better.
*  They can run the ball.
*  I like their receivers.
*  I just think their quarterbacks just been bad.
*  I think I don't like them
*  because they have a lot of fantasy players
*  who have let me down,
*  and it might be because of Anthony Richardson,
*  but Michael Pittman,
*  like those are a ton of second tier receivers,
*  like Pittman and Flowers,
*  and I have all of them
*  that they just don't ever produce.
*  Monday night, somehow the Chiefs are home
*  for another Monday nighter.
*  The league's really throwing them some bones this season.
*  Yeah.
*  Hey, Mike, are you playing a Monday night at home
*  in narrow head?
*  It's just.
*  Bring on the Sunday, Mike.
*  Come on, I don't want to go to Minnesota.
*  It's freezing.
*  Chiefs home for the Bucks,
*  and I'm going to say Chiefs by seven.
*  I said six.
*  Nine and a half.
*  Oh.
*  Jesus.
*  They're just killing Tampa.
*  They're not the Chiefs necessarily,
*  the odd fandal, just no respect.
*  And they put up some lot of yards today.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's it.
*  Yeah, you win.
*  Another win for me.
*  Yeah, you're up.
*  I need you on coding.
*  This is a problem.
*  Five, three, one, you're up after nine weeks.
