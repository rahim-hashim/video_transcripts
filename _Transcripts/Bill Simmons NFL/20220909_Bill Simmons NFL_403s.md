# Bills Blow Out the Rams: Is L.A. in Trouble? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnszokFYYcE)
*  The stuff that I noticed between the two teams was that the bills seem like they actually added to their team and made their team better.
*  Von Miller was huge, obviously, if you watch the game, you know that that was he was one of the biggest players in the game.
*  Jameson Crowder actually helped them. Isaiah McKenzie, who had some moments last year, just looked like they were a little more well-rounded.
*  And their offensive line, they were running behind the left side and just pounding.
*  So I felt better about the 2022 bills than I did about the 2021 bills.
*  Again, it's one game.
*  The thing I really want to talk about is the Rams because the Rams, you could feel it the whole game.
*  They couldn't block the running backs.
*  I thought all three backs on the bills look better than any of the Rams running backs.
*  It was cut by himself.
*  We never saw Allen Robinson.
*  At one point I was trying to remember, did Emmanuel Sanders retire or Allen Robertson?
*  And then I realized it was Emmanuel Sanders.
*  Robinson was out there, was doing a lot.
*  They had no deep threat.
*  They obviously missed Odell in a huge way.
*  They missed the way he could stretch the field.
*  But over and over again, it just kind of felt like it was Cup and a bunch of random dudes, which is how the Super Bowl felt.
*  And they pulled it off and they barely wanted to have that drive.
*  But this time around, you think they lose Von Miller there, replace him with Wagner, who did not have the greatest game.
*  The offensive line, they lose Andrew Whitworth.
*  So the offensive line looks worse.
*  The running backs, they never addressed that.
*  Collinsworth mentioned there might be too much pressure on Cup and you could feel it during the game.
*  At one point, I think he had like probably 60% of the targets that Stafford had.
*  So there's that, that, you know, what is he going to have?
*  170 targets this year.
*  They're just going to have to figure out how to help them in some way.
*  The game management was awful.
*  What they did in the last three minutes.
*  I thought that was bad where they called timeout with 2.16 left.
*  Basically gave Buffalo a fourth timeout.
*  Somehow got an interception and then couldn't even figure out how to manage the clock.
*  They settled for a field goal of 10-10.
*  Then they start the third quarter.
*  Guy takes it out of the end zone, gets tackled at the 10, three and out.
*  Buffalo has the ball basically at midfield.
*  And at that point you would bet anything Buffalo is going to win the game.
*  All of this was really, really alarming, I felt.
*  And there's some Super Bowl hangover stuff that you feel like is a piece of this.
*  So I went back and I looked at the 20 21st century teams that just kind of stunk the next season, stunk for a Super Bowl champ.
*  Right.
*  And we have five.
*  We have the 2003 Buccaneers who went seven and nine after they won the Super Bowl.
*  The 2006 deal was eight and eight.
*  And that they had the Rathausberger off the field stuff.
*  There was some off the field stuff that I think affected that 2012 Giants, nine and seven.
*  2013 Ravens, eight and eight.
*  And the 2018 Eagles, nine and seven.
*  And there's other teams that weren't good the next year, but they were teams that transitioned.
*  Right.
*  Like, like the Broncos, they moved from Peyton Manning to I think Brian Greasy.
*  No, Brian Greasy followed John Elway.
*  They moved from Peyton Manning to just a slew of quarterbacks that sucked for the next six years.
*  In 1999, same thing with the Broncos where Elway retired, they moved Brian Greasy and then they
*  weren't totally the same team.
*  I think these five teams, 03 Bucs, 06 Steelers, 2012 Giants, 2013 Ravens, and 2018 Eagles,
*  the year after the Philly special.
*  Those are the five that I guess would be the parallels for this.
*  And really the 03 Bucs, I think, and the 2013 Ravens, especially because those were older
*  teams that kind of went all in to try to win the Super Bowl.
*  They did.
*  And then the next year, all hell broke loose.
*  The 2013 Ravens, ironically, they played the first game of the year at home and they lost
*  by 22, the Rams lost tonight by 21.
*  I don't think any of this is good for the Rams.
*  And it just looks like they're worse.
*  They look slower.
*  And I was alarmed even when it was 10-10.
*  It just didn't feel like there was, I was on multiple techs, like, wow, they just don't
*  look like they're on the same level as this Bills team.
*  I don't know what this means for the NFC going forward because I only really had six
*  playoff teams that I liked.
*  And if the Rams are just going to have one of those seasons.
*  Yikes.
*  I met Minnesota, Green Bay, San Francisco, Trey Lance.
*  I don't know.
*  Philly, I like.
*  Tampa.
*  Then you start going into, can Carolina surprise us?
*  That was my sleeper team.
*  New Orleans, but we might be in a situation where the AFC is just way, way, way more
*  loaded than the NFC.
*  And you look at Buffalo, they have by my account, five tough games left, which three
*  of them are coming up week three at Miami, week four at Baltimore, week six at Kansas
*  city, week eight home for Green Bay and week 17 at Cincinnati.
*  The fact that they took this one down and they're one and oh, I mean, they answered
*  certainly some of the questions I had.
*  They look better than they did last year.
*  They responded to the hype, but then going forward, like if the schedule is a little
*  bit easy, they look like they've just completely unlocked Josh.
*  And one of the things I worried about them was what happens with Brian day ball
*  leaving.
*  Turns out that didn't matter.
*  The new offensive quarter came in, he crushed it.
*  He was able to use Alan rushing around and.
*  I was really impressed by Buffalo, but I'm also not sure if the Rams are good.
*  And that sounds like I'm pouring water on the Buffalo wing.
*  And I'm really not because like Buffalo didn't play that well, and they turned the
*  ball over three times in the first half.
*  It wasn't like there were lights out second half.
*  There were lights out.
*  And, uh, and the fact that.
*  We ended at 31 to 10 with four turnovers.
*  Buffalo ends up having.
*  We're going to know four weeks from now.
*  All right.
*  Was Buffalo that good or did the Rams stink?
*  And that's the great thing about week one, you can jump to, cause I ever reacted to
*  this game 19 times as it was going along.
*  Are the Rams bad or is Buffalo this good?
*  And that's one of those things you just don't know for a couple of weeks, but I
*  would lean toward Buffalo is probably really good.
*  I don't know if they're 17 and oh good, but they're really good.
*  But the Rams might be really bad.
