# Is Patrick Mahomes on Track to Be the Greatest of All Time? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [February 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pHN2MpAIuw)
*  You know, I was watching SportsCenter after,
*  and my homes did a stand-up interview with Chris Berman
*  and Steve Young and Booger,
*  and was just standing on the set for five minutes,
*  casually talking about the game,
*  and I'm like, I thought his ankle was bent
*  five different ways, what's going on?
*  What's the rest of the story here?
*  And sprinted to go to Berman, right?
*  He was like, oh, he's over there, all right,
*  I can get there in under three and a half seconds.
*  He couldn't get to me all the way!
*  Well, maybe this will lead to a new,
*  I don't know, football philosophy,
*  where teams will pretend their guys hurt
*  more than they did, or whatever,
*  because it worked!
*  I mean, it was one of the reasons
*  people were picking the Eagles this week,
*  was, ah, my homes, you can't really move.
*  Hit the key player of this game,
*  what did he scramble, for 30 yards?
*  How long was that?
*  And like, at some point,
*  when you're running that fast and that far,
*  whenever you come down, that's it, man,
*  it's gonna hurt, it's gonna sting,
*  like, unless they carry you into the end zone,
*  you're in trouble, but that was when I thought,
*  oh, come on, he got right up,
*  he shook it off, it is a weird thing,
*  but, I mean, he won MVP, he's plus 130,
*  you were gonna give it to him,
*  anyway, he had under 200 yards passing, right,
*  but the three touchdowns, and just, I guess,
*  by the fact of just being in there,
*  and everything else, he deserves it.
*  He was awesome, he, after he hurt his ankle,
*  he went 13 for 14 for 92 yards and two TDAs,
*  and we could talk about the bad ref stuff,
*  but I think we should talk about my homes,
*  and I think we should talk about
*  how bad the Eagles defense was for what we were expecting.
*  They sucked, I can't remember,
*  can you remember three plays they made,
*  like, somebody tagged Pacheco in the fourth quarter,
*  really good hit, that was a good play,
*  they didn't tip a pass, they didn't create a turnover,
*  I don't think they had, did they have a sack,
*  or they had a sack where my homes ran out of bounds,
*  but it turned out to be a ZLVM-I?
*  The Chiefs had a sack when Hertz ran out of bounds,
*  the Eagles, I don't think, had a sack, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, you know, how many games do we see where,
*  oh, but a quarterback, he should have had three interceptions.
*  Nothing close at all with that for my homes, right?
*  That wasn't really one play, but it's like, wow, that should,
*  and I needed my homes to throw an interception to catch
*  like a pretty substantial parlay.
*  The only, on the other side too,
*  like I think Hertz only threw one ball up for grabs,
*  otherwise it was very clean, no sacks, no nothing,
*  no holds really called until that last one,
*  which made it even worse.
*  The my homes resume, two time Super Bowl champ,
*  two time Super Bowl MVP, that's a pretty small list,
*  twice an MVP, he has been twice the passing touchdowns leader
*  once the passing leader has made the Pro Bowl
*  five years in a row, and this feels like
*  the start of something, like that,
*  there's some GOAT potential now,
*  because you need to get those two early,
*  Brady got the three early, and then you need to get
*  the one more. He needed to win this one for sure, yep.
*  Yeah, yeah, then it's a little bit different,
*  and they caught lightning in a bottle,
*  but they did a good job in some ways
*  with how well they did with the draft,
*  which was, you know, you give them credit for that,
*  but at the same time, when you have this many rookies,
*  they make that big gamble with the Tyree kill trade,
*  you really have to hit your draft, and they did.
*  They took a bunch of like gambles on the Schuster,
*  Kaderius, Tony, those type of guys,
*  and all of them made plays in this game,
*  Schuster was the one that got interfered with at the end,
*  Tony made a big punt return off one of the worst punts
*  in the history of the Super Bowl,
*  and Tony could just get the road to get started.
*  That was big, but they patched this together,
*  and it was a really impressive team building,
*  and at the same time, I felt like they could have lost
*  every one of the playoff games.
*  Oh, Jacksonville.
*  Yeah, it's true.
*  When do you start talking, putting him in the conversation
*  with Montana and Brady, four out of five?
*  He has to win four out of five Super Bowls,
*  or three out of four?
*  Yeah, it's so early, it's such a race now,
*  especially like in the podcast era,
*  where every podcast has to have some sort of big sweeping
*  narrative, whatever, but he's...
*  I heard Mark Maron talking about it,
*  I was like, whoa, calm down, dude,
*  you don't even...
*  He's talking about his HBO show.
*  He's certainly hitting all the checkpoints,
*  which is the big thing, and I think,
*  the thing for me is all the stuff adds up together,
*  like Kellerman had a tweet that I liked today
*  that I randomly saw where he said,
*  the eyeball test says they're the best,
*  the stats corroborate that impression,
*  and their team wins the most,
*  and that's what Michael Jordan had,
*  and that's why we ended up settling him as the GOAT,
*  and Mahomes is hitting those checkpoints,
*  so I agree with Max, I thought that was a smart point,
*  but there's so much work left,
*  and there's so much luck that goes into this,
*  and I think Brady ended up, he got the seven,
*  he got the six with the Pats,
*  and that seven easily could have been 10,
*  it also could have been three, so you need...
*  You gotta win those 50-50 games.
*  You're very mature, you're very mature
*  the way you're analyzing this.
*  I have to say.
*  I think most Patriots fans say that seven should have been 10.
*  Right.
*  I lost money in Philly, but I never felt awesome either way.
*  I mean, there's a reason the line was one and a half,
*  and you're thinking, if you'd taken KC,
*  your theories were don't bet against Mahomes,
*  don't bet against Vegas,
*  which we should talk about in a second,
*  don't overreact to the dominant team
*  that had the bad schedule, which is basically Philly,
*  all the quarterbacks, that was a big talking point
*  last two weeks.
*  And then, something I didn't realize,
*  there was a little Nobody Believes In Us
*  with the Chiefs offensive line,
*  which a couple people mentioned,
*  like we're taping this podcast,
*  it was actually probably about an hour plus after the game,
*  and that was the theme in the post game,
*  where they were like, oh, yeah,
*  we saw all the stuff about Hassan Reddick as the MVP,
*  like they saw all that stuff,
*  and the offensive line was awesome today,
*  certainly better than I thought they were gonna be.
*  Did you think that was gonna be a problem for them today?
*  Because I did.
*  I didn't think it would be as big a problem
*  as it was against Tampa,
*  when they couldn't get anything off, right?
*  Mahomes was running for his life,
*  but I don't know if he's smarter,
*  or the offensive line is bad,
*  I guess it was just better,
*  but yeah, I mean, I'm not gonna lie to you,
*  I bet a bunch of Eagles would get a sack,
*  and they didn't.
*  Well, one of the things with Mahomes,
*  he's assumed the imaginary,
*  it's not even imaginary,
*  I don't know what the right word is,
*  but Braden used to have it,
*  where you're just thinking like,
*  ah, that's too much time,
*  or oh, they should be up more,
*  you left them too many,
*  you left them too big of a window,
*  he's gonna come back and get this.
*  Like even when the Eagles score,
*  they're down eight,
*  they go down, they get a touchdown,
*  they get the two point,
*  they make it 35-35,
*  and in normal football situations,
*  you're thinking, that team has all the momentum,
*  oh my God, the Chiefs have to be reeling,
*  and with KC, you're just looking at it going,
*  oof, five minutes for Mahomes,
*  they might not get the ball back,
*  Chiefs are gonna get out,
*  or at least get a field goal.
*  There's no other quarterback like that,
*  and I don't know who else for you has
*  kind of been in that territory, right?
*  Brady definitely,
*  I think Manning was there for a little while,
*  pretty long.
*  For me, as a Cowboys fan,
*  oh, just out there watching.
*  Just in general, like betting against them,
*  or watching them, whatever, in our lifetime,
*  that list is like less than nine guys.
*  Yeah.
*  Where you're like, oh shit.
*  Less than five, I think.
*  I don't think it's, yeah, well, who is it?
*  You wouldn't put Lamar Jackson,
*  I'm trying to think of the best quarterback.
*  No, like Josh Allen, I wouldn't put in there.
*  Yeah, I think Elway for me is in there,
*  because I was always just completely terrified of Elway,
*  and we just saw him do it so many times at the end.
*  And Marino,
*  and Marino, Fouts.
*  Yeah, yeah, a couple of those guys.
*  You put Fouts in there, I never got to see Fouts enough.
*  I just feel like they move the ball a lot.
*  I don't know.
*  I guess I have to look at fourth quarter comebacks
*  and stuff like that.
*  But, you know.
*  Favre was one of those where if you bet on him,
*  you were worried he was gonna go throw a pick,
*  and if you bet against him,
*  you were worried that he was gonna come down and beat you.
*  Both sides were worried with Favre.
*  Everything was in play.
*  TD, interception, whatever.
*  And there's been guys that had little runs.
*  I think Burrow was basically in the same situation
*  two weeks ago, right?
*  He's in that Mahomes situation.
*  He goes down and gets some points,
*  you go to the Super Bowl,
*  and he couldn't get it done.
*  So we were talking Mahomes and Burrow two weeks ago,
*  and Mahomes grabbed it.
