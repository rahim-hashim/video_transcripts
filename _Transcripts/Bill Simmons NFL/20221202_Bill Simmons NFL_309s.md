# Itâ€™s Make or Break for the NY Giants | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [December 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JP5rct0Ic5c)
*  You have two minutes to try to talk me out of taking the Washington C words over the
*  Giants minus two and a half this week. There's a bet where you can do the Washington Moneyline
*  with the Washington. You can adjust the under to 52 and a half. They'd have to score 53 points
*  to lose that bet. My only take on it is that the Giants are, are now two games in a row to losing.
*  They're at home. This is like make or break time for Daniel Jones and Saquon Barkley. They get back
*  Olajari, who's one of their best pass rushers. They get back Big Evan Neil, the tackle. They get
*  guys back and they're going to try to save, salvage this season. This is it. They have to win here.
*  They play the commanders, the Eagles, the commanders again. They've got to win this game.
*  And they're at home and it's like, are the Washington commanders this unbeatable team?
*  My fear is their front four, if they get Chase Young back, they've got Payne, they've got Sweatt,
*  they've got Allen, they've got Chase Young. I don't know if that's just too much for the
*  Giants offensive line, but like to me, this is a pick them game. I don't think that the
*  commanders are going to light up the Giants at MetLife on Sunday.
*  So Washington's always scored 30 points once a season. They needed one of those lateral TDs
*  when you're winning the game and the other team starts laterally. That's how they got to 30.
*  They've won six of seven. They're good. They lost to many by three. The Giants have their one and
*  three in their last four. And the one that they won was that Houston game that they tried to give
*  away for three hours. The thing for me here, here's why I'm really against the Giants.
*  And I've been watching. Barclay's not right. I don't think he's the same guy that he was
*  in September. And I don't know whether overuse, he got worn down. I don't know if his shoulders
*  fucked up. 26 carries for 61 yards, but he looks like the Barclay from last season,
*  not the guy from September and October. And I just don't think, unless he's Superman,
*  I don't think they can beat a team with a good defense. And we've watched Washington over and
*  over again, just pull these games out. I just think to me, they're just better. I just think
*  they're a better team. I also think the Giants offensive line was healthy early in the season.
*  They are completely rattled again. And you got guys like Nick Gates is a great story. And Giants
*  fans know like hasn't played football in a year. He goes back. He's starting last week. It's great
*  stories, but Saquon is it's him. And then it's a lot of guys that you're asking a lot out of.
*  And Saquon is their number one player. I think teams can zone in on him and it's not going to be
*  easy when you've got eight men in the box and like, Hey, Saquon beat us.
*  Well, the other thing is they're basically, it was a little gimmicky, right? The first four or
*  five weeks, like where are the Giants? Don't wow. They're going to use Danny Dimes like this. Yeah.
*  I don't know. After like six, seven weeks, you study some tape. You're like, hey, when they're
*  in this thing, I'll put this guy here. I don't know if there's a plan B for them. Like if you've
*  noticed they've been throwing the ball more the last couple of weeks. It's like DJ had over 30
*  or a hundred two weeks ago, but I don't see it. I think this Washington team's good. I think it's a
*  playoff team. I agree. And I think they're really good and they're sound and Robinson runs the ball
*  hard. I don't think that the Giants are, should be favored by any means. I'm just saying if the
*  Giants have anything left in the tank, they have to do it this week and there's no climbing out of
*  this hole for them. So it's like now or never for the Giants. Well, they have Philly next week too.
*  Yeah. Washington has Giants this week by home Giants. So they're just like, man, if we take
*  care of this by week, the coach can do the whole, I'll see you guys on Wednesday.
*  Let me ask you, if you're the Giants general manager, Joe Shane, who inherited this roster
*  and the salary cap nightmare, are you bringing back Daniel Jones? And then question two,
*  are you bringing back Saquon from big money? I don't want to pay big money for running backs.
*  I would just go get Damon Harris for one third of the money and be totally happy or whoever.
*  There's like 10. Yeah, there's going to be a lot of free agents. These guys, they're just
*  falling out of the woodwork, the fucking Jets. It's like, hey, I'm nice guy. All right, throw them in.
*  What about Daniel Jones? If he demands a certain amount of money, do you think he's done enough to
*  deserve, not, he's not going to get Lamar or Watson or Allen money, but like, does he deserve
*  starter money? No, I think, I think you roll the dice with the mint shoe type or I don't know how
*  to trade for Bailey's Zappi or Bradley Zappi, either one. Bradley's good. Bradley Zappi can
*  sling it. Bradley Zappi can sling it. So can Bailey. I look, it's like basketball where if you're paying
*  whoever 15 million bucks a year to be like the seventh best guy in your team, what are you doing?
*  Just go, just go try to game the system, try to get something up a comer.
*  I'd like Jones, but if it's more than like seven, eight million a year, you can't do that. Oh no,
*  it's going to be. I mean, I would think. Yeah, you just can't. Yeah. I would think he's looking at
*  like, and I don't say this talking to his agents or anything. I would think Daniel Jones is starting
*  prices like 18 to 20. I would imagine. I don't know where he's getting that. All right, Trader.
