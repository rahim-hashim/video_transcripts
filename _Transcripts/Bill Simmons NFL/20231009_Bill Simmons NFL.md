# Can Bill Belichick Hold On for the Head Coach Win Record? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [October 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkZ_kANuUbI)
*  My team is minus 76 with a one and four record.
*  They've scored 55 points total.
*  They have 10 turnovers this year.
*  The 2016 Patriots had 11 turnovers the entire regular season.
*  So they're one behind the 2016 Patriots for turnovers.
*  I did my power pole mostly to see where I would put them.
*  And I have them 30th.
*  I think Carolina was 32nd and Denver is 31st because Denver's defense,
*  you know, they've given up 181 points there.
*  Even the jets can get to, you know, mid high twenties against them.
*  But New England, it's Carolina, Denver, New England, probably Chicago, maybe the
*  Giants, maybe Arizona.
*  I think there's six teams that are going to be in this Caleb Williams sweet stakes.
*  And the question that I was texting my friends about today is just like, it's time, right?
*  Like they, if we're ever going to have a chance to get another franchise quarterback,
*  this season seems like it's wide open.
*  They have a really tough schedule.
*  They've had injuries on defense already.
*  They have the worst offense in the league other than maybe Carolina.
*  And I can't think of a single reason why this team would think it as a chance to
*  compete because it's not going to be able to.
*  They got absolutely annihilated by New Orleans today.
*  Annihilated.
*  The game was over immediately.
*  Mack is unplayable.
*  They have, I would say one of the four worst lines in the league.
*  They have no skilled position guys you would write home about.
*  And the defense got worse because of the injuries.
*  I just don't see a path for them not to be like three and 14.
*  So why not embrace it?
*  Why not trade a couple guys and try and try to bottom out?
*  I think this is the year to do it.
*  I'm with you, but you know, I mean, you're just not, you don't want to say it's the coach.
*  I mean, Dennis Allen came into your coach's house and stole his girlfriend while he was
*  playing miss Pacman.
*  Like it was crazy that he just, I mean, that was, that was my stay away on Ringer wise guys today.
*  I said, this is crazy.
*  This isn't saying guys.
*  Patriots were embarrassed.
*  The saints who have trouble scoring just as much are coming to Gillette.
*  This is Dennis Allen against Belichick.
*  And this is in the tic tac zone.
*  Like it's fluctuating between minus one and plus one.
*  And I think instead of doing a power pole, like I was curious what you thought about
*  as far as they, I feel like they have no identity, right?
*  Like, so what percent of this team resembles the Brady team?
*  I think last year you could have still said 40% or 30%.
*  Now it's gotta be down to almost zero.
*  I don't think you could have said it last year either because remember all the dumb,
*  sloppy shit that was happening last year.
*  I think this is, this is year five of dating back to Brady's last season of like, man,
*  this doesn't seem like a Belichick team.
*  We've been saying that for five years.
*  He's in his early seventies.
*  You know, people I've talked to a lot of people.
*  I talked to my podcast on Thursday.
*  I think this is his last year as coach.
*  I felt that way before the game today.
*  And I think for at least the coach, the Patriots, I think this is going to be.
*  Someone else is going to take him.
*  What does he offer to another team?
*  I think Mayo is going to be the coach.
*  They're either going to, he's going to retire or they'll fire him or he'll go to another team.
*  He can't go anywhere else.
*  However it plays out.
*  The win total thing is really interesting though,
*  because everybody's saying he's going to hold on until the record.
*  Well, do the math.
*  Shula has 347.
*  It's the regular season and the playoffs combined.
*  That's what they're calling the record, which is interesting
*  because it kind of favors the more modern coaches.
*  But Shula's 347.
*  Belichick is 330.
*  He's got two 99 regular season, 31 playoffs.
*  And the thinking is, well, he needs 18 more to pass Shula.
*  It's a lot.
*  This team, this is a four win team.
*  So throw this year out.
*  Now we got to hope like, oh, can it be a 10 year team?
*  Even if you say he stays on the paths, it might be like another three and a half years, right?
*  Like he's going to have to jump to another team.
*  Here's the other thing.
*  And I haven't heard anybody mention this.
*  So Andy Reed is at 273.
*  He is 57 behind Belichick right now.
*  He's got two 51 regular season, 22 playoffs.
*  And you think he's going to gain another 10 this year.
*  So by the end of this year, he'll be like mid thirties away from Belichick.
*  He's six years younger than him and he's got my homes.
*  He's going to go 12 and five, 13 for every single year for the next four plus two to
*  four playoff wins.
*  He's going to pass Belichick in five, six years.
*  I think if Belichick wants that record, he also has to worry about the Andy Reed part.
*  And it's not going to happen in New England.
*  Like I said Thursday, Chargers or Washington.
*  Chargers is where if you really want to keep the record and move it along, you got to attach
*  to Justin Herbert.
*  But from what the other owners have watched with this Pats team, we're like, oh, my God,
*  we have a chance to get Belichick.
*  Right.
*  I'm looking, as you say this, at like, yeah, Andy Reed's going to have a nice ending to
*  his number if he should pass Shula Shula himself.
*  11 and five, nine and seven, 10 and six, nine and seven.
*  So he didn't have the problem Belichick has of like, you know, three or four wins.
*  It's like a baseball.
*  Can I compare someone to baseball?
*  But it's like a baseball player who's hitting 240 as a 38 year old trying to stick around
*  to get his 3000.
*  Right.
*  He's like Miguel Cabrera on the tag.
*  Yeah, right.
*  So just kind of hang on.
*  Yeah, I think it's going to be he's in a division with Josh Allen.
*  He's in a conference with Alan and my homes and Burrow and Herbert.
*  And the smart move would be to switch franchises heading into next season if he wants to record
*  and try to do it that way.
*  It's time for a divorce.
*  And I guarantee Kraft wants to bottom out this year and get a top five pick.
*  This is one of the best QB classes, probably like one of the three best of the century.
*  I was watching Caleb Williams last night.
*  That guy's fucking amazing.
*  You get that guy.
*  It's like you're basically getting my homes.
*  And that was a terrible Caleb William game, by the way, if you look at his stats.
*  But the two touchdowns he scored the one in overtime.
*  He's amazing.
*  He's an electric football player.
*  Really good.
*  And Drake May and I know there's some other people that people like.
*  Yeah, but let me ask you this.
*  Would that would those guys take the Patriots to the play?
*  Would Patrick Mahomes, Patrick Mahomes might take the Patriots to the playoffs.
*  What other quarterbacks would take the Patriots to the I know.
*  Yeah, it's fun to blame Mac Jones, but what other quarterbacks would take them to the
*  playoffs this year?
*  Like that's just a piece of it getting.
*  I think what Herbert's Herbert's Chargers team is not really any better or worse than the Pats.
*  You think like Mike Williams is already out.
*  Equers played one game.
*  Their defense sucks.
*  Their coaches worst in Belichick, right?
*  And they went two and two and, you know, they're probably going to be at least 500
*  because he single handedly made them competitive.
*  So I would put him on there.
*  I looked at I don't know, man.
*  I don't know what happened to your team today.
*  Three hundred and sixteen yards for the Saints.
*  That's not even like.
*  But but how do you lose thirty four?
*  Not that when the other team scored had three hundred bail weight three hundred yards.
*  It's very weird.
*  It's a turnover machine offensively and defensively, they lost their best
*  cornerback and their best pass rusher.
*  I think it being a home game was actually bad for them.
*  The crowd got bummed out immediately.
*  It just went from bad to worse.
*  Their car started getting confidence.
*  Camara always kills them for some reason.
*  But yeah, I think if you're going first coach fired.
*  Is Belichick one of the three coaches now?
*  I can't believe I'm saying this.
*  I feel like I'm going to get struck by lightning.
*  But we're just talking about twenty twenty three.
*  Like this is the reality of the situation.
*  It's funny, you and I would always we'd always go over this in the beginning of the year.
*  And he was always like a hundred to one.
*  And I said, you know, he could get arrested for something.
*  It is evil.
*  Yeah, he has to.
*  There's always that factor.
*  But yeah, now it's just on its merits.
*  Even Fluss is would be the favorite right now.
*  I haven't seen these numbers in a while, though.
*  There were rumors that if they lost that Thursday night game,
*  he was going to get bounced because they had like ten days, but they won.
*  Rivera, I think, is always in the mix, especially if you watch that Thursday game.
*  Belichick and then Brandon Staley, I think, would be the other one.
*  But I can't believe Belichick's even in that conversation.
*  But I think the Andy Reid piece of it is really underrated because.
*  Yeah, that's true.
*  I hadn't looked at that.
*  That might be seventy to seventy five wins for the next five years for him.
*  Just with being teamed up with Mahomes.
*  And so do you think Belichick's looking at that like, all right, you know what?
*  What does this matter if my record?
*  Which is Schuylas record is going to be bounced in four years.
*  What do I care?
*  You know, I have to watch that as an 80 year old happen.
*  Maybe you're right.
*  Maybe that's it.
*  Maybe he cares.
*  I think he's like a historian of the game.
*  Also, the thing with Kraft, that can't be understated because the Brady thing was a huge.
*  You know, a huge thing between them and Kraft wanted to take care of Brady and Belichick
*  wanted to move on and thought he was an old player.
*  And that came a pretty divisive thing that did not work out.
