# NFL Guess the Lines Week 6 With Cousin Sal | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [October 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU)
*  It is time for guest Alliance week six. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=0.0s)]
*  I think you're going to beat me because I guess these 12 hours ago in a new [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=4.86s)]
*  center. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=7.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=8.02s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=8.74s)]
*  I was off on a few. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=9.38s)]
*  Thursday night, a shockingly important game. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=11.1s)]
*  40 Niners at Seahawks. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=13.84s)]
*  And, uh, if the Niners win, both of these teams will be three and three. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=16.56s)]
*  And if the Niners lose, they'll be two and four and the Seahawks will be four [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=22.52s)]
*  and two. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=25.46s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=26.12s)]
*  I think the 40 Niners are favored. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=27.72s)]
*  And I'm going to say 40 Niners by two. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=30.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=33.76s)]
*  You edged me out. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=34.24s)]
*  I was like, Hey, let's start the week with a perfect one and a half, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=35.64s)]
*  which is my favorite. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  You said two. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=39.76s)]
*  It's a full three. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=40.92s)]
*  Oof. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=42.6s)]
*  They didn't like what they saw with the Giants. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=43.84s)]
*  Three on the road. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=45.24s)]
*  Yep. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=46.68s)]
*  The Seahawks are missing, missing people and I'm not ready to write them off yet [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=48.2s)]
*  because they can throw the ball. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=52.8s)]
*  They didn't do a great job of it today, but they had a bizarre game plan today. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  They're running backs on, they had seven carries. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=58.0s)]
*  They just, the Giants were just controlling the ball and that it felt like the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=60.48s)]
*  Seahawks kind of panicked when they got the ball. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=63.96s)]
*  They were like, we can throw in these guys. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=66.4s)]
*  And they, and they just kind of got away from who they are. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=67.76s)]
*  You mentioned the Metcalf fumble, but yeah, that offense should be way more [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=70.36s)]
*  in sync than it is. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=73.76s)]
*  The one thing I'll say about this line is don't the Niners, doesn't it seem like [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  they need all the days to get healthy? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  Like Kittle doesn't practice on Wednesday or any of these guys. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=80.6s)]
*  Thursday game might be tough for them, especially, I mean, going to Seattle [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=84.08s)]
*  also, but. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=87.88s)]
*  I'd like to thank you on Jennings who I've had on my bench for three weeks. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=89.16s)]
*  And then finally I was like, you know what? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=92.44s)]
*  You've earned it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=93.84s)]
*  I'm going to start the day buddy. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=94.64s)]
*  1.9 points for him. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=95.96s)]
*  The Sunday at Mark. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=99.12s)]
*  Oh, we got to go London game. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=99.92s)]
*  We're back in London. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=101.84s)]
*  Oh, good. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=102.64s)]
*  Rich Eisen's still there. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=103.08s)]
*  Does he just stay there? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=104.12s)]
*  He doesn't leave. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=105.4s)]
*  What happens? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=106.12s)]
*  Jags bears. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=110.36s)]
*  This is something. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  Technically a bears home game. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=116.64s)]
*  Yep. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=118.08s)]
*  This is something, something really, really horribly incompetent is going to [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=119.16000000000001s)]
*  happen in this game. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=124.2s)]
*  And I have a lean on who it's going to be, but I think the Jags have to be [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=125.04s)]
*  favored. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm going to say Jags minus one. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=129.0s)]
*  Damn it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=132.28s)]
*  Oh, we tie. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=134.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=135.28s)]
*  I had one also. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=135.48000000000002s)]
*  It's one and it's the bears minus one and a half. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=136.52s)]
*  Oh Jesus. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=140.24s)]
*  A lot of love for the bears. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=142.36s)]
*  So why do you think that is? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=144.2s)]
*  They, they definitely have a little bit of a pass rush. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=145.56s)]
*  There's no question. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=149.0s)]
*  And they can throw the ball against bad defenses. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=150.64s)]
*  I would say those would be the two things I would like about them. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=154.88s)]
*  And what's the, if any, um, you know, what's the, what, what kind of advantage [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=157.32s)]
*  do you give spread wise to the Jaguars in London, even though it's not [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=163.67999999999998s)]
*  technically their home game? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=167.16s)]
*  Half a point because they're there. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=169.12s)]
*  They're there. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=171.04s)]
*  They're there. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=171.64s)]
*  Half a point because they're there. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=172.28s)]
*  They win there. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=174.16s)]
*  They're very good there. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=175.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=178.32s)]
*  I would say half a point to a point. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=178.48s)]
*  They're used to going there. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=180.16s)]
*  And so the bears on a neutral field is, are that much better than, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=182.84s)]
*  I think that line flips. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=186.2s)]
*  It's a weird one. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=187.4s)]
*  Sunday's marquee game. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=188.56s)]
*  Kudos to us. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=190.4s)]
*  We finally have a Ravens Washington meaningful football game. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=192.32s)]
*  It's her four. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=196.32s)]
*  I can't remember this ever happening. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=196.96s)]
*  It's a good one. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=198.72s)]
*  Is it? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=199.32s)]
*  Uh, when would they even get at the same time? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=200.08s)]
*  Like RG three, RG three. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=202.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=204.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=204.64s)]
*  Maybe like right around there. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=204.8s)]
*  It's in Baltimore. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=207.32s)]
*  I had the Ravens by three and a half. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=209.88s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=211.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=212.12s)]
*  Good. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=212.44s)]
*  I get this. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=213.0s)]
*  I said four and a half. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=213.56s)]
*  It's six and a half. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=214.56s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm way off. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=216.8s)]
*  Way up there. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=217.76s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=218.68s)]
*  There's cheap touchdown potential. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=220.24s)]
*  Listen, Washington's gonna be able to throw on Baltimore. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=221.92s)]
*  Just period. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=223.68s)]
*  That line's too high. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=224.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=226.72s)]
*  They just don't respect it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=226.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=228.51999999999998s)]
*  They just don't respect them. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  Like they do the bears. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=229.84s)]
*  Like they only link three to Cleveland. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=230.84s)]
*  So I guess in the ball doesn't touch the ground when you watch Washington. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=233.44s)]
*  It's just like completions. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=237.39999999999998s)]
*  They're all over the place and they have speed. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=238.64s)]
*  Watchables. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  Saints bucks is a watchable kudos to the NFC South. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  What a turnaround. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=247.76s)]
*  What a rehabilitation. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=248.64s)]
*  I'm excited to watch this game. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  I have a, I'm done. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=253.04s)]
*  I'm done with the South. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=255.95999999999998s)]
*  I got it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=257.03999999999996s)]
*  Give me your number. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=257.4s)]
*  I didn't say it to bet on it, but I like watching it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=258.23999999999995s)]
*  I had fun on Thursday night. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=260.12s)]
*  I enjoy watching the Falcons. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=261.44s)]
*  I feel like I've watched every Falcons game. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=262.84s)]
*  I have a Saints minus three. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=265.08s)]
*  We're going to split it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  I said two and it's two and a half. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=268.79999999999995s)]
*  Um, what's fun about it? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=270.96s)]
*  Like the NFC South, like I really, like I get it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=273.0s)]
*  Whoever should win doesn't win. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=277.12s)]
*  We get it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  Tampa should have won that game. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=280.4s)]
*  And if you don't finish the game in the last two minutes, then that means you lost it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=285.88s)]
*  Yeah, I get it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=286.28s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=287.16s)]
*  I just, uh, I'm just not interested in more. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=287.8s)]
*  Why couldn't I have just enjoyed my Mets and not watch that game that sent me [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=291.16s)]
*  in a tailspin at Tampa lost. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=294.6s)]
*  Lions at Dallas. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=298.96000000000004s)]
*  So I'm going to change my pick on this because I would have said lions minus [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=304.6s)]
*  three, but since you won and look confident, I'm going to knock that down [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=308.72s)]
*  by a half point and say lions favored by two and a half in Dallas. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=311.76000000000005s)]
*  Goodbye. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=315.56s)]
*  Bye. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=316.0s)]
*  You. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=316.2s)]
*  I said Dallas minus one. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=316.96s)]
*  I'm still a delusional, a hopeful fan here, but it is Detroit by three. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=318.6s)]
*  You get that. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=326.04s)]
*  My original guess was the right guess. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=326.64s)]
*  Yep. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=328.44s)]
*  And that's not a little high. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=329.92s)]
*  That's not a little bit high. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=331.28s)]
*  I know they're going to throw on us. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=332.56s)]
*  I know. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=333.96s)]
*  I know you'd a lot of guys have never heard of a defense. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=334.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=338.68s)]
*  And don't, don't expect them to make a name for themselves. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=339.08s)]
*  They played well against Pittsburgh. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=342.64s)]
*  A little different than playing Justin Fields. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=343.96s)]
*  Well, you remember in Dallas last year, these two played, right? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=346.32s)]
*  I think it was a Saturday night and there was a controversial call against [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=349.15999999999997s)]
*  the lions that I'm still upset about. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=353.4s)]
*  I still don't think they got that right. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=355.28s)]
*  Very, very upset. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=356.96s)]
*  Fairly watchable is Eagles home for the Browns. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=360.2s)]
*  And I just don't see how the Browns can't be in the Vegas zone now every time. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  So I'm going to say Browns by four and a half or Eagles by four [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=369.15999999999997s)]
*  and a half over the Browns. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=372.47999999999996s)]
*  I went high. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=373.71999999999997s)]
*  I went seven. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=374.47999999999996s)]
*  It's eight and a half. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=375.28s)]
*  Oh Lord. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=377.0s)]
*  Oh, that's absurd. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=379.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=381.76s)]
*  Should the Eagles be favored by eight and a half over anybody? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, they definitely have the rest advantage from the buy and you know, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=386.03999999999996s)]
*  all right, how many points to the Brown score? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=393.12s)]
*  13. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=396.2s)]
*  I don't think the Eagles should be favored by that much over any team. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=397.76s)]
*  What have the Browns? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=401.08s)]
*  I mean, we were wondering if their coach was going to get fired over the buy. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=401.91999999999996s)]
*  Now they're eight and a half point favorites. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=404.32s)]
*  That seems weird. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=405.84s)]
*  13, 16, 15, 18, 17. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=407.2s)]
*  So if the Black Jack Browns, the Black Jack Browns, Black Jack Browns 17th [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=411.8s)]
*  day, that's it. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=417.4s)]
*  Packers are home for the Cardinals. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=422.2s)]
*  Weird Packers game today. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=426.59999999999997s)]
*  They, they have the same game. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=427.84s)]
*  They have this tight end that I picked up in all my leagues and he was a delight [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=429.64s)]
*  today. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=434.32s)]
*  He's turned into Rob Gronkowski, crap, but, uh, dubs didn't play. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=434.59999999999997s)]
*  Watson's hurt, go figure. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=440.28s)]
*  So they're down to basically the two receivers in craft, but it didn't really [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=442.24s)]
*  matter against the Lions. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=445.36s)]
*  You said it, you said, I think you said, uh, love pull the Levis, right? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=446.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=450.52s)]
*  Like, uh, you don't usually win a game like that when you give up a pick six [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=450.71999999999997s)]
*  so 99% chance. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=455.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=458.03999999999996s)]
*  Oh, I have a, I have a baseball playoff nitpick. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=459.88s)]
*  They put the wind probability at the top now. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=464.52s)]
*  Who is that for? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  Like morons? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=469.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=471.84s)]
*  Who's that for? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=472.8s)]
*  Like haven't, haven't we paid enough homage to the nerds that we now have to [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=474.76s)]
*  have wind probability. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=479.76s)]
*  It's like, Oh, the Dodgers are up eight, nothing. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=480.84s)]
*  The ninth, their wind probability is 99%. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=483.76s)]
*  It's like, Oh, is it? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=486.2s)]
*  It's really likely they're going to win. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=487.8s)]
*  Uh, that's came back. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=490.24s)]
*  They were only 10% wind probability. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=491.44s)]
*  It's like, do we need wind probability to describe a comeback? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=493.4s)]
*  Like we need a stat to say that something was awesome. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=497.03999999999996s)]
*  Who started this? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=500.15999999999997s)]
*  Couple bad things about it. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=501.47999999999996s)]
*  It's really stupid. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=503.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=504.4s)]
*  There's so many other stats I'd rather see than wind probability. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=505.08s)]
*  I like to see what the guy was up. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=508.15999999999997s)]
*  They were there at 3%, then it was 70%. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=509.91999999999996s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=512.96s)]
*  Also, it can't be great for viewership. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=513.48s)]
*  Like if you're telling the viewer, uh, Hey, um, the Phillies have a 93% chance of [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=515.56s)]
*  winning the viewer might be like, Oh, all right, I'm going to go put on the Liberty [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=520.16s)]
*  and ACES, you know, like, why do I have to watch? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=523.4399999999999s)]
*  So it's that psychologically baseball doesn't want their fans to have any sort [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=526.0799999999999s)]
*  of natural reaction and watching. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=531.52s)]
*  It just has to, you just have to, it's all AI now. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=533.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=535.92s)]
*  It's like, Oh, I really wish the Phillies could come back here, but the wind [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=536.16s)]
*  probability says we only have a 2% chance. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=540.28s)]
*  Yep. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=543.0s)]
*  They're done. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=543.4399999999999s)]
*  ESPN loves that more than anything. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=544.72s)]
*  I hate it. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=546.9200000000001s)]
*  I don't like it either. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=548.0400000000001s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=548.8000000000001s)]
*  They have it in like the second inning. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=549.36s)]
*  It's a 75% chance to win. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=550.72s)]
*  It's that there's 22 more outs. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=552.72s)]
*  I don't even believe a million things can happen. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=555.48s)]
*  I don't even, and in the NBA, I hate it the most because like we see someone [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=557.8000000000001s)]
*  overcome a 17 point deficit three times a week in the NBA, right? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=562.08s)]
*  More somebody's down 17. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=566.6s)]
*  They hit how are you making that 95% like stupid? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=568.24s)]
*  Dumb. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=571.76s)]
*  The worst. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=572.9200000000001s)]
*  I hate wind probability. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=573.8000000000001s)]
*  You just don't like it because you don't understand it. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=577.4000000000001s)]
*  You're an old man. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=579.6400000000001s)]
*  I understand. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=581.4000000000001s)]
*  You're an old old man. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=581.84s)]
*  Let's just, how about this? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=583.2s)]
*  I won't, I won't watch the game. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=584.12s)]
*  Just, just text me what the wind probability is. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=585.36s)]
*  I'll get super excited. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=587.96s)]
*  It's like, Oh, they're up to 88%. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=588.9200000000001s)]
*  I don't need to watch the game. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=590.8800000000001s)]
*  Anyone tells me a wind probability at a party. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=592.0s)]
*  I smack them in the face and I move on. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=594.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great point. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=597.08s)]
*  When have you ever had a sport, a conversation with anyone in a social [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=598.36s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=807.04s)]

*  get out, get, get the offense back on the field, I'd pick KC. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=812.28s)]
*  Steelers. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=816.12s)]

*  And I'm going to say six and a half over the Pats. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=842.12s)]
*  Yeah, you got it. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=844.4s)]
*  I went light on it. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=845.28s)]
*  I said five and a half. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=846.16s)]
*  It is a full seven. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=847.1999999999999s)]

*  This is not a game to start Drake May. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=851.96s)]
*  Well, you know, what's a big problem. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=854.16s)]
*  You're going to win because favorites of seven or more haven't won in like 13 [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=855.72s)]
*  years or something. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=861.0s)]

*  Colts at Titans. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=875.24s)]

*  Cause I can't see anymore because it's 219 in the morning. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=892.28s)]
*  My eyesight's blurry. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=894.96s)]
*  I'm going to make the letters bigger. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=896.8s)]
*  I need to hit all three to tie you. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=898.6s)]
*  And I'm going to definitely get one wrong. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=901.56s)]
*  Colts Titans seems like the kind of game Raheem is going to bet as his wisest pick [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=903.0s)]
*  on the Sunday Ringer pregame show. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=906.84s)]
*  This is the week for Will Levis. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=908.44s)]
*  Raheem can't quit shitty teams. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=910.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=912.9200000000001s)]
*  Falcons at Carolina. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=914.1600000000001s)]
*  Speaking of shitty teams. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=915.6400000000001s)]
*  So I don't think the Falcons, I mean, I don't think the Panthers can be getting [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=918.0s)]
*  less than four against any 500 and up team. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=923.24s)]
*  So I'm going to say Falcons by four in Carolina. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=925.72s)]
*  That's a good, good way to look at it. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=927.6800000000001s)]
*  I said three and a half. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=929.6s)]
*  So of course you get it. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=930.8800000000001s)]
*  It's five and a half. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=932.08s)]
*  Oh, I lose again. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=933.48s)]
*  Unlike Raheem, I'm done like singing songs about bad teams. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=935.36s)]
*  Like all week I'm like the red rifle, Andy Dalton, 60 points in two games. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=940.0s)]
*  Like this is a bad team. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=944.6400000000001s)]
*  If I, if I have to circle it in the pool and get lucky, I'm not going to brag [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=946.24s)]
*  because it is just luck. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=950.84s)]
*  You know what I was looking at today? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=952.6400000000001s)]
*  Cause I was in Boston going through the Fandel and I, you know, it's, yeah, I had [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=953.9200000000001s)]
*  to bunch of people in the pool and I was like, I'm going to get lucky. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=959.2800000000001s)]
*  You know, it's, yeah, I had a bunch of time until the game started the really bad [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=963.28s)]
*  team. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=968.5999999999999s)]
*  So the three worst teams are Carolina and New England and maybe Miami without a [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=968.92s)]
*  quarterback and like the bears were three and a half over Carolina. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=973.0s)]
*  The Pats were like Miami was two and a half point favorite, but you figure law of [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=977.68s)]
*  averages, if you're like a two and 15 or three and 14 team, um, Oh boy, my computer [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=982.0s)]
*  is going to run out of battery soon. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=989.8399999999999s)]
*  Speed this up. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=991.7199999999999s)]
*  Um, where are we? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=993.28s)]
*  Lose probability is 19%, but you do the 13 minus 13 and a half line on the [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=996.36s)]
*  favorite or the minus 17 and a half. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1004.04s)]
*  You just go for a blowout. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1006.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1007.88s)]
*  But the shitty teams get blown out all the time and you get like, they're like [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1008.16s)]
*  five to one, seven to one that there's going to be a blowout. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1012.0799999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1015.3199999999999s)]
*  So I was thinking that so that the bears hit no Miami did, but yeah, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1015.64s)]
*  the minus nine and a half. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1020.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1022.96s)]
*  What was the bears line? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1023.2s)]
*  I forget it. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1024.96s)]
*  You have no juice in your computer. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1025.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1027.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, what was the adjusted? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1027.28s)]
*  I was like, you probably got five to one or something. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1028.6000000000001s)]
*  No, the adjusted was like, it was probably like four to one, 13 and a half, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1030.28s)]
*  something like that. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1034.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1035.3600000000001s)]
*  That's good. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1035.8400000000001s)]
*  Sunday night Bengals at giants. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1036.88s)]
*  I'm going to say Bengals three and a half. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1038.28s)]
*  Yeah, we both had three and a half. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1041.3200000000002s)]
*  Boy, this was shaping up as a bad. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1043.4s)]
*  This is all of a sudden a good game now. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1045.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, one that is a good game. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1047.52s)]
*  That's a really dangerous game for the Bengals, especially if, uh, they have [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1048.76s)]
*  neighbors back for the giants with the receivers we saw it after, I think it [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1052.48s)]
*  threw them. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1056.52s)]
*  I love calling the Bengals. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1056.76s)]
*  You know that bill. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1058.6s)]
*  You know it. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1059.68s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1060.8s)]
*  This is my league neighbors. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1061.96s)]
*  Is he for real? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1063.08s)]
*  Mike, is he for real? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1063.96s)]
*  Just as Mike, I might, I might do the icky shuffle right here in this booth. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1065.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1070.2s)]
*  I think we're probability of my pants right now is like 85%. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1071.28s)]
*  Monday night bills at jets. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1075.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1080.76s)]
*  I am going to say bills minus three. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1080.84s)]
*  Uh, we split it. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1084.04s)]
*  It's two and a half. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1085.36s)]
*  I said two. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1086.32s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1087.8s)]
*  Another one at 2 30 AM for you. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1088.68s)]
*  I'll tell you what, that's a fascinating Aaron Rodgers game. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1092.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1097.0s)]
*  Is everyone going to be back on the Aaron Rodgers train after they pulled this out? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1097.6s)]
*  It's a good game. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1100.8799999999999s)]
*  When probability is very high that people will be talking about Aaron Rodgers this week. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwJc-C2OvU&t=1101.48s)]
