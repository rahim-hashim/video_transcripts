# Million-Dollar Picks Divisional Round With Joe House and Sheil Kapadia | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw)
*  All right. Million dollar picks round two. I'm going to throw out some possible bets. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=0.0s)]
*  Ravens minus one and a half. We talked about. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=4.44s)]
*  Sheel sounds like he's you just like the dog. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=6.36s)]
*  You don't feel like you're just afraid of the game. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=9.84s)]
*  It seems like I took the bills in my official picks, but it was a coin flip. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=11.88s)]
*  So, yeah, don't let my opinion there change what you got. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=15.56s)]
*  I'm sticking with my Malcolm Gladwell blink test on that one. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  I just I felt before I even knew what the line was. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  I was like, I just like the Ravens. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=23.84s)]
*  I think it's a bad matchup for the bills. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  The bills are playing the chiefs. I feel better about it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=26.92s)]
*  I just don't like the Ravens bills. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=29.24s)]
*  So we're probably going to put something on Ravens minus one. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  Now, there's a couple parlay teaser options with chiefs, eagles, lions on Fandool. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  We do a little eight point tease, even odds. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=40.599999999999994s)]
*  Oh, we could take the Eagles all the way to plus one and a half. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  I know. I know it infuriates Rahim, but it's actually better odds than the Moneyline [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  parlay to do the eight point tease and to bring everything down. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=52.84s)]
*  There's a seven point tease that's plus one twenty. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=56.76s)]
*  And there's a six point tease that's plus one forty. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=60.44s)]
*  So you would have Baltimore. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=62.92s)]
*  I'm not sorry. Casey minus two and a half. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=65.4s)]
*  The Eagles minus two and a half. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=67.76s)]
*  Oh, no, the Eagles, even lions minus two and a half. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=71.44s)]
*  So my my instinct is the eight point tease. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=73.56s)]
*  And you just have to win the chiefs. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=77.36s)]
*  You just have to win the Lions. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=80.04s)]
*  And then you get the free point and a half in the Eagles game. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=81.8s)]
*  And that's even odds. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=84.28s)]
*  And who's going to fuck us is my instinct. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=85.19999999999999s)]
*  Any any alarms for either of you? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=88.91999999999999s)]
*  I feel like if you lose that, you get to watch a Jaden Daniels classic [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=92.16s)]
*  playoff game, I think other than that, you're safe. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=95.91999999999999s)]
*  So it'll be worth it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=98.56s)]
*  I think that lions thirty three and a half is too high, but I don't want to bet it [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=99.52s)]
*  because I could also see a world where they score like 50 points. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=102.84s)]
*  But I just think it's too high. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=105.28s)]
*  I think they're trying to sucker you into it's a lot of points, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=106.64s)]
*  especially with how we laid out the game. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=109.8s)]
*  I like the Mahomes 25 plus rushing yards bet. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=112.92s)]
*  That's one 15 yard scramble [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=117.84s)]
*  when he does the thing where he sticks the ball at the end [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=121.04s)]
*  and then gets a cheap shot and tries to pretend he got knocked unconscious [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=123.4s)]
*  for a second to try to get the flag and two more scrambles. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  It's like a four for twenty seven shield. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=130.56s)]
*  Does that make sense to you? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=133.04000000000002s)]
*  I think so. Yeah. And the Texans like to play man coverage. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=134.56s)]
*  They've got good corners. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=137.36s)]
*  So there there could be some plays in there where he has to hold on [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=138.4s)]
*  to the football, make a play and he takes off. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=141.4s)]
*  So here's my concern. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=144.4s)]
*  And I'm going to make a recommendation. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=146.28s)]
*  You can't parlay this, but I prefer attempts to yards [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=148.28s)]
*  when it comes to Mahomes because kneel downs count as attempts [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=152.4s)]
*  and kneel downs behind the line of scrimmage detract from your your rushing total. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=156.76s)]
*  So if he's in the low thirties and they are running out the football [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=162.16s)]
*  at the end of the game and he kneels down twice, you're all of a sudden in the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=165.6s)]
*  in the, you know, real danger zone of getting down to like 24 yards [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=169.64s)]
*  and you lose your bet. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=174.88s)]
*  The total for rush attempts is four and a half. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  Three rushes over the course of the game and then two kneel downs. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=180.32s)]
*  You collect on your bet. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=183.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's one that I like. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=185.16s)]
*  That's a better right there. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=187.0s)]
*  I feel like I need to take notes. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=188.48s)]
*  I'm in awe. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=189.88s)]
*  Like that is a man who has been burned by a kneel down [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=190.67999999999998s)]
*  at some point in the last 10, 20, 30 years. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=193.32s)]
*  Shea, which one do you like more, the four point five runs or the 25 plus yards? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=196.16s)]
*  House only on the kneel. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=201.6s)]
*  Come on, you can do both. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=203.52s)]
*  Yeah, no, I'm doing parlaying, but that's plus one ten on Fandel. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=205.56s)]
*  I'm going to mark that one down. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=209.56s)]
*  So Kelsey and Hopkins to both score touchdowns. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=211.28s)]
*  Plus nine thirty one. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  Mentioning it, Hopkins to score plus three ten. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=220.48000000000002s)]
*  I it's been interesting watching them integrate him into their offense, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=224.4s)]
*  and it seems like they really like them inside the ten. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=228.68s)]
*  Usually it's Kelsey and it seems that they like him too. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  I've always had bad luck with the TD bets, but I mentioned that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=235.52s)]
*  Stafford and Stroud to both throw a pick. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=239.0s)]
*  So two road QBs against good defenses, both throw a pick plus one ninety five. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=243.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I love that one. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  I love that one. I think it's it's I like the two to one on Stroud is like crazy. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=252.76s)]
*  It's like minus 160 for him to throw a pick. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=258.28s)]
*  It's some crazy number. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=260.36s)]
*  So you're this is really a Stafford bet. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=262.03999999999996s)]
*  And what's the what's the status of Higby? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=264.68s)]
*  I mean, is he is he? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=267.24s)]
*  I think he's supposed to play, but I don't know. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=269.68s)]
*  Yeah, that that that's a big. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=272.08s)]
*  You'll see Luke warm on the on the double pick that one ninety five. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=273.96s)]
*  Listen, it's fun. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=277.76s)]
*  My only concern would be if it's snowy. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=278.84s)]
*  Are they going with a run heavy game plan? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=281.4s)]
*  And then the Eagles are having one of those drives where it's like the Eagles [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=283.4s)]
*  have possessed the ball for 11 minutes in the sense [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=286.2s)]
*  we doesn't have the opportunities to throw the pick. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=288.52s)]
*  Great point. But listen, it's a little you have to put it's a sprinkle. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=291.2s)]
*  It's a tiny devil. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=295.52s)]
*  It would be a sprinkle. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=296.84s)]
*  I'm not going to say no to any bet like that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=297.56s)]
*  Henry and Barkley both scored touchdowns plus one thirty four on Sunday. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=300.35999999999996s)]
*  The little Sunday running back stud touchdown parlay. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=304.59999999999997s)]
*  Henry with hurts. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=308.35999999999996s)]
*  Bumps to plus one seventy five touch pushy. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=310.79999999999995s)]
*  Something five yard scramble. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=315.44s)]
*  Had we both Kurtz to the plus one seventy five play both. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=317.96s)]
*  Josh Allen touchdown is plus one oh five. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=322.56s)]
*  The other one jump out. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=326.64s)]
*  Well, I do the the other that when you were talking about the running backs, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=328.56s)]
*  I like Saquon and Derek Henry [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=331.56s)]
*  longest rush. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=334.96s)]
*  Derek Henry's is like 20.5. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=336.08s)]
*  Saquon Barkley's is 18 and a half yards. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=338.4s)]
*  I think both of those guys are going to get the ball a lot [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=341.64s)]
*  and break one of them throughout the course of the game. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=344.2s)]
*  So that's just if you're worried about getting cheated, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=347.08s)]
*  like you said, on a touchdown where Saquon Barkley runs it to the one [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=349.08s)]
*  and then they give it to Jalen Hurts. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=352.84s)]
*  That's one I would look at. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=354.48s)]
*  I like the Barkley one specifically over 18 and a half yards as his longest rush. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=355.48s)]
*  So pairing that with something with Henry could make sense. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=359.8s)]
*  What are the odds on that longest rush? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=363.44s)]
*  Do you remember? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=365.12s)]
*  I can't. I think it's around minus one ten probably. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=366.08s)]
*  Hmm. House, have you ever experimented with the longest rush? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=369.4s)]
*  I feel like I'm doing an exotic tequila shot. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=373.0s)]
*  I was really excited. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=376.12s)]
*  I mean, it's minus minus one twenty for Barkley, 19 and up. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=377.36s)]
*  And then for Henry, it's probably I'm going to guess the same. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=382.68s)]
*  That will be [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=386.64s)]
*  twenty and a half minus one twenty. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=390.92s)]
*  So you try to hit both of them, probably split one, maybe lose a little vague [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=393.04s)]
*  or hit both. What do you think, House? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=397.0s)]
*  Parlay them, just put them together. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=399.08000000000004s)]
*  I agree with the idea that both of them are going to get them. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=400.8s)]
*  Both of those teams are committed [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=404.12s)]
*  in a way that that, you know, the future of the franchise is based on those two [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=406.68s)]
*  dudes going out and getting Russians are going to get all the touches. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=410.48s)]
*  They're going to have all the opportunity. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=412.96000000000004s)]
*  And if we believe in those offensive lines, then they're going to get there. Oh. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=414.40000000000003s)]
*  It's a plus two thirty six. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=418.6s)]
*  And now, and now. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=420.48s)]
*  So we need Henry for 21 yards. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=422.24s)]
*  Barkley for 19. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=425.68s)]
*  That's happening. Come on. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=429.12s)]
*  But it's amazing. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=430.64s)]
*  They change the odds on the card, the shield special. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=431.72s)]
*  Put it on the card. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=434.76s)]
*  All right. So we're going to add that one plus two thirty six. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=436.36s)]
*  And then there's some most rushing yards that I thought were interesting. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=439.88s)]
*  Henry plus three twenty, Barkley plus one fifty five. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=444.92s)]
*  The Barkley plus one fifty five, I thought was a little delectable. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=448.88s)]
*  Gibbs plus five fifty, but Montgomery is probably going to be back. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=452.68s)]
*  So I don't know how many carries is going to get. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=455.76s)]
*  But the rushing receiving one I really liked was McLaurin [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=457.96s)]
*  plus eight fifty for most yard, most receiving yards this weekend. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=461.96s)]
*  Hmm. Some garbage time stuff. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=465.68s)]
*  One long one. House seems dubious. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=469.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, I kind of like it. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=472.84s)]
*  The they I don't know how deep they're going to try and go. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=475.76s)]
*  It would have to be a little bit of a catch kind of thing. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=480.76s)]
*  But that's the thing, right? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=483.44s)]
*  Look at the scripts for the other teams. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=484.52s)]
*  To me, it might be Xavier worthy. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=486.36s)]
*  I honestly think worthy is going to get like a hundred or what do you like? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=488.08s)]
*  Yeah, I I have one of my best bets of the weekend is McLaurin [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=493.28s)]
*  over sixty eight and a half receiving yards. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=496.47999999999996s)]
*  I mean, they're going to have to they're going to have to move the ball. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=498.56s)]
*  He is by far their go to target. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=502.0s)]
*  The Lions don't have a number one corner. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=503.88s)]
*  The Lions don't play the type of defense where they're going to put a safety [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=505.92s)]
*  over top of them. They're going to say we can be aggressive and play man coverage. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=508.8s)]
*  I had McLaurin last week and it was it was fruitful. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=512.52s)]
*  He had it very early in that game. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=515.96s)]
*  And you're right. Two of these games are in bad weather, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=517.8s)]
*  you know, potentially Buffalo and Philadelphia. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=519.96s)]
*  So now if you and maybe even Kansas City. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=522.36s)]
*  So you get the weather aspect of it being easier to throw the ball. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=524.16s)]
*  So, yeah, I'm in on the McLaurin overs. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=527.16s)]
*  So plus eight fifty, most rushing, most receiving for the weekend. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=529.16s)]
*  I think it's worth that little. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=533.08s)]
*  I'm on that. I'm on that. Yes. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=535.0s)]
*  Hail, baby. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=536.5600000000001s)]
*  And then the last one. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=538.76s)]
*  Washington plus four and a half plus one eighty two. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=541.72s)]
*  Is it worth a dabble? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=545.32s)]
*  I'm out. So you have to you get the answer from Sheel. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=548.2s)]
*  So so you have the Lions in the other. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=552.12s)]
*  Tease at what minus two and a half. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=555.6800000000001s)]
*  It's like a very, very hairy metal, which is why you probably don't do it. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=558.84s)]
*  If you take the Lions, you're just rooting for the Lions. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=563.36s)]
*  Yeah, it might be it might conflict you. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=565.64s)]
*  But if you didn't have the other bet, I would say again, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=567.76s)]
*  Jaden Daniels rule, if it's over a field goal, why not? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=571.8000000000001s)]
*  See how I've never seen how to do this before with gambling, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=577.48s)]
*  where he doesn't want to jinx his own team. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=581.2800000000001s)]
*  It's really interesting. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=583.0s)]
*  It's a divisional round of the f-ing playoffs. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=584.36s)]
*  It's been 25 years. Like, what are you talking about? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=586.5600000000001s)]
*  It's not surprising at all. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=589.32s)]
*  I haven't been in this position in forever. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=590.44s)]
*  OK. So we only have a few weeks left. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=593.32s)]
*  I mean, why if you're feeling it, go with it, you know, it's not like week three. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=596.36s)]
*  You play my mom just to play my McLaurin over to be satisfied. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=600.76s)]
*  You made a great case to play McLaurin over. It's fine. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=604.2s)]
*  All right. Do we like Josh Allen touchdown for plus 105 or no? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=607.88s)]
*  Not really. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=613.2s)]
*  I think I think, I mean, you know, decent chance to do it. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=615.2s)]
*  It's time. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=619.76s)]
*  The million dollar picks round two here with Joe House and [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=623.44s)]
*  Sheil Kapadia, we're up one point eight, six, seven million for the season. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=627.72s)]
*  We took last week off. We're coming back strong. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=631.96s)]
*  First bet, an eight point tease on FanDuel [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=634.88s)]
*  with the Chiefs minus eight and a half, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=639.1600000000001s)]
*  the Eagles minus six and a half and the Lions minus eight and a half. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=642.48s)]
*  We're teasing all of them down. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=647.1600000000001s)]
*  It is even odds on FanDuel. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=648.76s)]
*  We are breaking the Raheem Palmer rule. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=651.4s)]
*  We're teasing the Eagles through the zero. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=653.4399999999999s)]
*  I can see him like almost having a convulsion right now. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=656.4399999999999s)]
*  But Eagles to plus one and a half. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=658.84s)]
*  The other two just to win. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=660.76s)]
*  That's plus 100. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=663.04s)]
*  We're going to put 300K on that. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=664.36s)]
*  Next bet, the Ravens minus one and a half. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=669.36s)]
*  Sheil was nervous about this one. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=673.64s)]
*  House and I just think it's no disrespect to the great people. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=675.48s)]
*  Buffalo bad matchup. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=678.56s)]
*  Wrong team, wrong time. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=680.5999999999999s)]
*  Ravens minus one and a half. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=682.16s)]
*  We are putting 250K on that one. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=684.4799999999999s)]
*  And then we're going to dabble on some stuff. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=688.4s)]
*  Some some 10K. Mahomes four and a half [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=690.88s)]
*  runs over plus 110. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=694.76s)]
*  Saquon and Henry Saquon 18 [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=697.56s)]
*  and a half yards over. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=701.4399999999999s)]
*  Longest run with Henry, longest run, 20 and a half plus 236. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=702.9599999999999s)]
*  That's right, Sheil. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=707.16s)]
*  I think so. Yeah, that is right. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=708.76s)]
*  Each bus runs were good. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=710.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great one. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=712.5600000000001s)]
*  Stafford Stroud, both to throw one interception [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=713.92s)]
*  as the road quarterback in bad and potentially bad weather games, plus 195. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=717.52s)]
*  So we're doing McLaurin over 68 and a half receiving yards. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=723.48s)]
*  One dude's two small McLaurin bets. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=726.5600000000001s)]
*  Yes, McLaurin over 60 and a half. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=729.64s)]
*  McLaurin to have the most receiving yards of the weekend, plus 850, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=732.72s)]
*  where there's two games outdoors. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=735.92s)]
*  He's one of the only ones indoors. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=737.4s)]
*  And what do you want to put in the parlays, 25K or 10K? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=739.92s)]
*  I mean, not the parlays, the prop bets. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=743.28s)]
*  10K is a good number. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=746.16s)]
*  That's all right. That's how people play. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=747.4s)]
*  10K. And those are the million dollar picks [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=749.64s)]
*  for round two. Sheil, happy gambling. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=753.1999999999999s)]
*  Good luck with the Eagles. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=755.12s)]
*  House happy gambling. Good luck with the Washington. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=756.36s)]
*  Whatever your name is now. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=759.16s)]
*  Oh, yes. Oh, yes. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=760.4s)]
*  Hail. All right. Thanks, guys. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIForMA9zw&t=762.24s)]
