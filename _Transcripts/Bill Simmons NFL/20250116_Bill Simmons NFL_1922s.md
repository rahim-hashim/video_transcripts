# If Ohio State Beats Notre Dame, Does It Make Up for the Michigan Loss? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU)
*  All right, Van Lathan is here. He's joining us. We're gonna talk college football. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=0.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=3.12s)]
*  Is this the first time you guys have been on a podcast together? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=4.0s)]
*  Yeah, ever. A lot of respect for this guy. Yeah. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=6.24s)]
*  Likewise, man. Likewise. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  College football. I'm gonna let you guys carry this. I'm just gonna be the point guard to set you up. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=10.88s)]
*  I'm gonna be like Reed Shepard in the G League. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=14.72s)]
*  Just just running fast breaks and raining threes. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=17.52s)]
*  Uh, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=20.88s)]
*  before we have Joel's five favorite things for college football before we do that. Notre Dame, Ohio State. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=21.84s)]
*  Every person I know who gambles on college football is like just throw Ohio State in a parlay. It's a wrap. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=27.119999999999997s)]
*  They're too big. They're [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=32.08s)]
*  bigger. They're better. Like this is this is done. They were the eighth seed this year. Yeah. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=33.68s)]
*  Is this done? There's Notre Dame. Is there nobody believes in this case? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=38.8s)]
*  Um, I think Notre Dame probably has a lot of bulletin board material. Uh, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=42.4s)]
*  people are on Ohio State like crazy. They have a ridiculously talented roster and they're peaking at the right time, right? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=46.8s)]
*  However, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  I [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=54.56s)]
*  despite all of the animus between LSU fans and Notre Dame fans [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=55.44s)]
*  online, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=59.92s)]
*  I am not ready to say that [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=61.04s)]
*  uh Freeman and his staff up there in South Bend are not going to find a way to make this game [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=63.92s)]
*  competitive and not have a chance to win this game in the fourth quarter. I think that they will. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=68.16s)]
*  What do you think Joel? I definitely think it's going to be closer than people think but at the end of the day [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=71.68s)]
*  your limitations are your limitations. Notre Dame can't pass. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  Right, like they can't pass the ball and I feel like that's going to be a real problem in a game where you I mean [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=81.52s)]
*  the thing about Ohio State, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=86.56s)]
*  which was we'll get into it in the list later, but somebody's supposed to slip free right like Trevion, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=89.12s)]
*  uh, you know, Queen Sean, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=96.48s)]
*  Jeremiah, Emeka, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=99.02s)]
*  Carnell, somebody is going to bust loose and like Notre Dame is going to have to do something other than put together a 13 plays [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  72 yard drive to keep up and I just think eventually after a while that takes a toll and they'll kind of fall behind [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=108.0s)]
*  but I do I agree with Van that it's going to be much closer and they're going to be a tougher out [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=114.0s)]
*  for Ohio State than people think. So I think what happened with me with Notre Dame was the last game [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=118.64s)]
*  I think there were a lot of questions answered. Now we could talk about Penn State and some of the limitations that Penn State has [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=124.08s)]
*  particularly the explosiveness that they lack in their downfield passing game, but [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=129.18s)]
*  a lot of things that people a lot of questions should I say that people are asking about Notre Dame in the game, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=135.2s)]
*  which was if they ever got behind right, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=139.67999999999998s)]
*  could they play from behind that the offense have enough wrinkles that they have [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=143.04s)]
*  uh dynamic enough talent on that side of the ball to get them back into a game where they couldn't [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=147.76s)]
*  play complimentary football defense like a Pittsburgh-St. Louis situation. Exactly. We're down 14 the game is now over [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  It's over it's it. Yeah, but they got down 10. Yeah, they got down 10 and Riley Leonard was even knocked out of the game which [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=159.44s)]
*  honestly, I think kind of worked in Notre Dame's favor a little bit because they weren't really preparing for the backup quarterback to come in [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=166.64s)]
*  and complete a couple passes and they played from behind and they made enough plays in the passing game in that game against a [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=171.92s)]
*  quality not quite as good as Ohio State defense, maybe not but it's not too pretty comparable a quality [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=178.62s)]
*  Penn State defense they made enough plays in the passing game to go win the game [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=185.7s)]
*  Um, they are facing an uphill battle, but for some reason I think the game will be competitive [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=189.85999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I I don't I don't if I don't I don't think I can't envision a scenario in which Notre Dame can get to 24 [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=195.29999999999998s)]
*  And that's why I don't think they can win [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=202.26s)]
*  And I feel like Ohio State can kind of f up and can can we we can curse here right? I can say fuck [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=204.18s)]
*  I can say fuck. Okay. I was like sure. Well, I know y'all cursed but I just i'm not i'm new here, right? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=210.18s)]
*  All right. Well, I think I think I think Ohio State can fuck around and get 24 like I mean, you know [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=214.82s)]
*  They can just luck up into a couple like you hit Jeremiah deep, you know a drive or whatever and I don't I Notre Dame again better than [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=219.86s)]
*  People that think they're going to be but I don't think they can get to 24. All right two follow-up questions off this one [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=227.7s)]
*  Ohio State was the eight that ranked eighth heading into the playoffs. So a year ago, they're not in the playoffs [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=234.34s)]
*  Yeah, so now they're gonna they're heavily favored to win the title [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=240.74s)]
*  So what does that mean big picture? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=244.5s)]
*  Were we just doing this wrong in the last 20 years? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=246.58s)]
*  Do we have to go back and go through all the times when maybe the wrong team won? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=248.58s)]
*  No, no, no, no, what does it mean? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=252.26s)]
*  I don't think that Ohio State necessarily deserves to be the national champion like by [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=253.7s)]
*  Like by the standards of the champions that have come before them. They are a failure [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=258.02s)]
*  They didn't beat their biggest rival [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=262.74s)]
*  They didn't win their conference championship [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=265.06s)]
*  So like it that they win like it redeems like the fuck-ups they had earlier in the season [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=268.02s)]
*  but I don't think it means that [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=273.94s)]
*  They deserve to have been in the playoffs like it's just a circumstance of history that they're in the playoffs [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=276.18s)]
*  But I don't you know, like they're the best team [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=280.9s)]
*  But they didn't live up to that during the year and if they didn't make the playoffs [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=283.54s)]
*  I don't think anybody would have lost any sleepover. Well counter they lost two games by four points [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=286.1s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=290.82s)]
*  Well, we'll talk about it. But like I mean, yeah, you watch had you watch Michigan play this year? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=292.42s)]
*  Yeah, I watched that game and it was the announcers were shocked as it was happening. I mean, yeah, what's your take? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=297.06s)]
*  So I think the dynamic [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=302.58000000000004s)]
*  It depends on which version of college football that you believe in. So if you believe the traditional college football [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=304.58000000000004s)]
*  uh [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=310.66s)]
*  Sort of way of doing things that I was brought up on i'm sure jules brought up on too [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=311.94s)]
*  Which was the most deserving team won the national championship after a full body of work [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=316.02000000000004s)]
*  Uh was was examined then ohio state's not there but [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=320.98s)]
*  What I think they were trying to move to by expanding the playoff [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=325.78000000000003s)]
*  was to see [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=329.94s)]
*  If they could get to a situation where the best team wins the the the uh, the national championship and that's on the field [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=332.42s)]
*  And that means that if you slip up a couple of saturdays, right? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=338.74s)]
*  um [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=342.1s)]
*  It doesn't matter because if you have the best roster and you're playing the best at the right time [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=343.14000000000004s)]
*  Then you get a chance to prove it on the field red. So like that michigan loss [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=348.58000000000004s)]
*  In the old system is catastrophic for them. Oh, well, it's over [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=352.66s)]
*  It's like one of the worst losses in the history of ahaha state. Now, it's not it's the worst loss that I can remember in [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=356.02000000000004s)]
*  That rivalry, but let's not even talk about ohio state. Let's talk about noter dame that lost at home to northern illinois [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=361.06s)]
*  Right, right. So that is a disqualifying loss [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=368.5s)]
*  In most iterations of the old way of doing college football. It is not in this particular day [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=372.26s)]
*  So is that better or worse? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=379.06s)]
*  I mean, I guess it kind of depends on what you think I wrote about this for the ringer.com. I know you did [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=381.3s)]
*  and so what I would say is that [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=386.02s)]
*  If college football fans can sort of disabuse themselves [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=389.06s)]
*  It's like as van said the most deserving notion and it's like well nfl fans when when brady and the bucks won the super bowl [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=392.1s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if anybody thought they were clearly the most deserving team or anything like that, but they won [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=399.46000000000004s)]
*  They were the champion and so like nfl fans accept that and it's going to be like washington with jaden daniels when he wins [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=404.5s)]
*  The super bowl in three weeks or it'll be like when a nine and 17 beat an undefeated [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=409.78000000000003s)]
*  Oh [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=415.22s)]
*  Also like that [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=418.5s)]
*  I blocked that out. I don't remember that happening [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=419.94s)]
*  Is that the patriots? All right. Sorry joe. Go ahead. No, but no, but I i'm with you on that [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=422.74s)]
*  So if it's gonna be like that then and we're gonna become college fans become nfl fans [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=428.02000000000004s)]
*  I'll be like, all right, that happens to be the champion this year, but I kind of [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=432.82s)]
*  I guess as an older dude, I kind of like the so do I every game [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=436.42s)]
*  You know like that loss in michigan should count for something like it should be [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=440.74s)]
*  Now in this way, it just made ohio state mad [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=444.82s)]
*  But it used to be that oh man like that the whole program crumbles ryan day has to go away [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=447.62s)]
*  Caleb downs is back in the portal all that kind of stuff [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=454.1s)]
*  um [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=457.14000000000004s)]
*  And there's a cultural question in columbus right now too with my ohio state fans [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=457.94s)]
*  And the question is it sounds stupid to people who don't understand college football and don't understand the rivalry [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=463.70000000000005s)]
*  Yeah [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=470.26s)]
*  But it's a question that's very much on the minds of people up there and the question is would you rather beat michigan? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=470.42s)]
*  Or would you rather win a national championship now the answer seems obvious. There's no ohio state fan right now [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=475.7s)]
*  On the precipice of winning the national championship that's going to say oh man like blah blah blah [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=483.14000000000004s)]
*  Like this doesn't matter as much but then [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=488.1s)]
*  the day after [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=491.06s)]
*  The michigan loss the week after the michigan loss [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=493.22s)]
*  Like when they were talking about ryan day the way that they were talking about ryan day [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=497.06s)]
*  They would have they'd be lying to you if they'd have told you right now that that wasn't a soul crushing moment [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=501.7s)]
*  That not even a national championship could completely repair and heal [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=508.82s)]
*  Right, like don't like I think that there's still questions even if he wins the national championship [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=513.06s)]
*  Is this the right guy? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=518.66s)]
*  You know like is this the right guy? It's hilarious though. Yeah [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=520.18s)]
*  He's lost to michigan four times in a row like are you bill are you familiar with the bayou classic? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=524.1s)]
*  I brought this up on racillo's podcast. Yeah, shout out to riggs, but the bayou classic [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=528.58s)]
*  At southern university rest in peace dad like they would rather beat gremlin than win the swag. That's a no-brainer [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=534.1s)]
*  Like it's a one game super bowl [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=542.02s)]
*  That means everything from some people that are traveling from up north in louisiana [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=543.46s)]
*  Down to new orleans us making a shorter drive and it's all on the line [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=547.54s)]
*  Right there and that's just the way college football is and if you ever get to a point [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=552.02s)]
*  where [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=556.74s)]
*  Ohio state fans will care even [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=557.62s)]
*  A centella less about beating michigan. You've lost the whole sport [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=560.5s)]
*  um [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=566.02s)]
*  noterdame [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=566.88s)]
*  Can you walk me through the relationship noterdame has now in? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=568.8199999999999s)]
*  2025 with america because I know what it meant [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=572.64s)]
*  In the 70s date is to me it felt like the biggest school on the planet forever and then all of a sudden it wasn't [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=575.86s)]
*  And then it came back and now where are we in 2025? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=581.38s)]
*  I mean, I think it's still probably personal it probably is the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=584.66s)]
*  Program that your grandmother is most likely to recognize [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=588.8199999999999s)]
*  Right, right. It's like it does have that and it no longer has the cache [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=592.5s)]
*  I mean there was a time that you know, this large catholic wealthy university [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=596.98s)]
*  Owned network it had all these advantages over everybody else. Well, we all know that that's not even true [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=601.3s)]
*  They lost a coach to lsu like we're not you know, no disrespect [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=606.1s)]
*  You know, but we can't lsu's not bammer. It's not texas. It's not ohio god. This is like shots fire [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=611.22s)]
*  Jesus I grew up when I grew up lsu was a seven and five ass program. It was seven and four. Oh my god [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=619.3s)]
*  Before kevin faulk i'm gonna get hit by a bullet. Okay before kevin faulk went to lsu [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=627.3s)]
*  And then definitely before nick saban got there [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=632.02s)]
*  They were like if texas a&m beat or lost to lsu i'd be like man, what happened to texas a&m? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=634.74s)]
*  So this is bullshit. So like so it so it is because lsu was down in the 90s [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=639.06s)]
*  That's for sure lsu won the sec a couple of times in the 80s [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=644.5s)]
*  Which was a hell of a time to win the sec the program was [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=648.26s)]
*  Pretty good. It was a very important. We had a heisman trophy winner all of that stuff [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=652.26s)]
*  We're talking about billy canter. Yeah, i'm talking about billy canter 1958 that matters, right? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=657.6199999999999s)]
*  We are talking about 1958. We are talking [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=661.6999999999999s)]
*  Hold on now, and now we can't do I get to count myself next title from 1958? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=664.3399999999999s)]
*  If you don't count all them titles from back [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=667.62s)]
*  Y'all call all of the titles from back in the uh segregated days [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=672.5799999999999s)]
*  in boston [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=676.5799999999999s)]
*  Not in the nba [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=677.86s)]
*  But but but what i'm saying is lsu when we came into college football [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=679.06s)]
*  Was down in the 90s and the reason why the program was down i'm not about to do a whole lsu defense [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=684.3399999999999s)]
*  It's because a lot of the best players from louisiana were escaping warwick dunn didn't go to lsu cordell stewart didn't go to lsu [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=688.9s)]
*  Some of these people what happened was nick saban was able to reorient [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=696.74s)]
*  and jerry dinardo to a degree was able to reorient the [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=701.86s)]
*  Position of lsu in louisiana where we could keep some of the talent back at home and when that started we became a perennial pow [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=706.6600000000001s)]
*  Let me let me throw this theory at you because I say that nick saban actually [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=713.3000000000001s)]
*  integrated the scc [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=717.3000000000001s)]
*  Like the way that he recruited at lsu if you look at like [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=719.46s)]
*  Recruiting rankings over those years like starting from like like the like 98 [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=722.58s)]
*  When when saban gets there like every year like the scc school like lsu starts creeping up the the recruiting rankings [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=727.22s)]
*  And then slowly but surely and certainly once by the time he goes to alabama [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=733.46s)]
*  All the other schools start to catch up and they're like, oh, yeah [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=737.5400000000001s)]
*  I guess we need to recruit these guys because it used to be there was a lot of reticence like even in [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=740.02s)]
*  Even in texas like there was some reticence that the university of texas [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=744.26s)]
*  They didn't really recruit the the guys out of the urban centers like dallas, houston [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=748.26s)]
*  Those guys went to florida state they went to you know, michigan or whatever [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=752.9s)]
*  They didn't go to texas and then like something happened in the late 90s early 2000s [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=756.7399999999999s)]
*  And I said like nick saban for me like when I look back at what he did [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=760.8199999999999s)]
*  I felt like he integrated the scc in a in a way, right? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=764.02s)]
*  And that and I think that's what was the inflection point for lsu but prior to that. Come on, man [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=767.9399999999999s)]
*  You know, which all were now in the 90s. We were down in the oh, come on [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=772.3399999999999s)]
*  I didn't I didn't know it's billy canan. I forgot about billy canan's husband [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=777.6999999999999s)]
*  Billy canons, you know what really happened shack went to lsu [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=782.3399999999999s)]
*  Huh everybody's what shack went to lsu and it bankrupted the whole school for like 10 years [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=785.86s)]
*  They're still playing them. They hired a guy [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=791.06s)]
*  This is and this is a cautionary tale for any college program. They hired a guy named curly hallman [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=795.4599999999999s)]
*  You for for most programs never trust a curly and by the way [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=802.02s)]
*  We're talking about bamma. It's so interesting that people go lsu is not bamma. Bamma was down [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=806.42s)]
*  for [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=812.5799999999999s)]
*  10 years too bamma was down super down. We were kicking bamma's ass every single year [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=813.6999999999999s)]
*  Until saban comes to bamma the first year saban was at bamma [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=820.0999999999999s)]
*  bamma loses [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=824.02s)]
*  To u.l monroe. So what i'm saying is any program out there, right? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=825.62s)]
*  You look at when bobby bowden leaves florida state what florida state has to go through until jimbo fisher gets there [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=829.6999999999999s)]
*  You leave it you look at texas and mac brown texas is just getting back [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=835.62s)]
*  It doesn't matter what color your blood is in college football [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=840.02s)]
*  If it's blue if it's red, whatever it is [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=843.7s)]
*  You are one bad coaching hire. Yeah, one bad coaching hire when we were coming up nebraska [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=846.74s)]
*  was an [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=853.22s)]
*  Unquestionable blue blood right tommy frazier laurence phillips all of these guys haven't been nationally relevant since colorado [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=854.8000000000001s)]
*  You're one bad hire one bad hire two maybe at the most from being in a situation [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=861.96s)]
*  You don't want to be i wasn't saying lsu was indiana. I'm saying that y'all would not know today [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=867.24s)]
*  No, we weren't nobody nobody ever nobody. Don't apologize to him. You're right [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=872.12s)]
*  Yeah, nobody thought lsu was like this great blue blood program. It's not about good solid program [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=877.4s)]
*  It's a good solid program [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=882.52s)]
*  But what i'm saying is that if you are a program and you represent a culture where football is very important [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=883.48s)]
*  Like it is in louisiana. It's like live or die in louisiana. It is whether it's lsu southern high school, whatever [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=888.76s)]
*  Um, you're actually one coaching hire away from being able to harness the power of your state [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=894.5999999999999s)]
*  Lsu was not in the same conversation with nother dame usc or historically and probably still is it but I will say [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=899.16s)]
*  Since 2000 you have three national championships. You've played for fourth national championship. Nobody wants to hear your credentials. You won the sec [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=906.3599999999999s)]
*  You had [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=913.88s)]
*  Two heisman trophy winners, are you happy with your program? Yeah, are you happy would you like a fucking booster? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=917.72s)]
*  It's like having buddy garrity here talking about am I happy with lsu right now? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=923.32s)]
*  No, I think we should be doing better [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=927.8000000000001s)]
*  but the the to me trajectory matters and it and the entire context of where you are matters and [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=929.0s)]
*  Coach oh who was a great coach in terms of what he was able to get on the character great a great coach character [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=936.6s)]
*  I mean i'm gonna be honest with you in terms of when I say he was a great coach. This is what I mean [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=943.32s)]
*  If you put together the team that we had in 19 together [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=948.12s)]
*  You gotta at least have the potential to be a great coach, right? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=951.24s)]
*  And so he wasn't a great long-term guy because he likes to fuck booster's wives and and like [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=955.24s)]
*  Allegedly whatever so he wasn't a good long-term guy, right? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=962.74s)]
*  And he left the program in shambles for what we needed for the time that we had him. He was good [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=966.44s)]
*  He took what less miles couldn't do [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=971.08s)]
*  Undefeated season all of that stuff now lsu is getting back to the point to where people in south, louisiana [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=973.4s)]
*  Are looking for real results from brian kelly and we'll see in the next couple years if we can deliver [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=978.84s)]
*  Can I throw a hottest take you guys most important guy this century for the scc dante cold pepper? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=983.4s)]
*  Why? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=989.72s)]
*  Because if saban picks drew breeze over dante cold pepper [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=991.0s)]
*  He never goes to alabama and then what happens the scc? Oh you're talking about we would we would have been alabama [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=994.44s)]
*  Would you? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1000.28s)]
*  Man, no, we would lift miles. Okay. No, no it it I don't know if that hottest take worked [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1003.4s)]
*  But I wanted to fire it up anyway, I think I was very inch. I like I like I don't I still think saban's in the nfl [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1008.36s)]
*  Now if he has drew breeze he would have had drew breeze for 15 years. Oh, no, I got actually I was confused [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1013.24s)]
*  You're saying he went to so if they say what I meant to say is they've been picked cold pepper over drew breeze [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1017.96s)]
*  Because drew had his her shoulder what I was saying is I got a little turned around [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1024.44s)]
*  I was saying is if saving never leaves lsu we'd have been bammer. We wouldn't have been bammer with less miles [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1027.6399999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, so you're saying if he if he stays in [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1032.28s)]
*  Miami and he has a lot of success there and he never comes back and yeah what happens? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1036.76s)]
*  I mean look, yeah for sure. I mean, that's the way things happen [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1040.6799999999998s)]
*  I'll say if if saban stayed at lsu lsu would have been better than bammer like the the bam like [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1042.76s)]
*  Lsu has a lot more going for it as a program and in terms of what it's like [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1048.12s)]

*  I made you have a list you can go five to one or one to five your choice [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1099.24s)]
*  I was gonna I was gonna go five to one. Let's do it. Okay, real quick bill [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1102.52s)]
*  Did you follow holy cross football from 2021 to 2023? Yes [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1106.76s)]
*  You did I was into it the quarterback play [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1111.24s)]
*  Well, he went to unlv and then left after three games [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1113.8s)]
*  Yeah [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1116.8400000000001s)]
*  So like that was my number five thing matt sluker going to unlv because first of all like I think it was one of the rare [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1117.4s)]
*  Things what it ended up? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1123.16s)]
*  Okay for everybody but for people that don't know sluker go [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1124.68s)]
*  He was the quarterback at holy cross transfers to unlv plays the first three games unlv looks great [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1127.56s)]
*  Like i was like, man, you know, he's got a good damn football program. What happened there? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1132.3600000000001s)]
*  Well, it turns out that he says [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1136.4399999999998s)]
*  he [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1138.84s)]
*  He decides to sit out the rest of the season and take a red shirt [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1139.3999999999999s)]
*  Because the school didn't follow through on whatever promises they allegedly made about nil and I thought well the follow-through is they didn't fucking pay him [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1142.4399999999998s)]
*  They like he whatever the money was. I don't I just don't think he got it [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1150.6s)]
*  They promised him a hundred thousand and he only got like a thousand right and I don't know which the [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1154.1999999999998s)]
*  There's still unclear like what the difference is here and why those expectations weren't met [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1160.28s)]
*  But it's like one of these things where you could project your feelings about the nil era onto the player [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1164.28s)]
*  In this situation and if you like me and you like players getting paid [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1169.08s)]
*  I didn't mind him withholding his labor until he got what he felt was promised and if you don't like it [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1172.76s)]
*  It was about like these spoiled and entitled college players [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1177.08s)]
*  Poetizing money over the team. So I thought it was like a really, you know, like a fun story [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1180.42s)]
*  that didn't ultimately hurt anybody because unlv still was badass and [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1184.84s)]
*  Wait though that there was a third piece to it though, which is you have like [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1189.88s)]
*  Thousands of these business deals being cut left and right right with teenage kids or kids who are 20 21 [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1194.76s)]
*  Yeah with these different colleges. They're probably not they're just like yeah. Yeah, we'll get you 25 000 by [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1200.76s)]
*  So there's so much room for sleaziness that I don't think we've ever seen before we've only had this boosters before you're just seeing now [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1206.76s)]
*  Uh the opportunity for people to get in people's ears and promise things that they can't then deliver on [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1214.3600000000001s)]
*  And the college athlete who? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1220.68s)]
*  Is now in a brand new world [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1223.24s)]
*  That's kind of like the wild wild west with not a lot of protections or structures there to protect them or their family [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1225.64s)]
*  Or protect the schools [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1232.3600000000001s)]
*  Either you're just seeing a lot of promises not being met. We'll see how who has the power at the end of the day [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1234.28s)]
*  It's either the wild wild west or it's like that new netflix show where just everybody gets brutally murdered [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1238.68s)]
*  What's that show american something the western? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1243.08s)]
*  Tim riggins is on it. It was on netflix. It's like set in the 1800s. Everybody just kills everybody. Oh, is that roots? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1245.96s)]
*  No [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1252.9199999999998s)]
*  No, it's the peter burgs there show [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1255.3999999999999s)]
*  It's called american something it's about wyoming and just it's like 1883 more violent. Anyway, all right [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1258.04s)]
*  Wow, all right, I'm gonna move to number four so [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1266.4399999999998s)]
*  You know nick saban was actually trying to be honest earlier this year when he said the only place you play in the scc [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1269.64s)]
*  That's not hard to play is in vanderbilt [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1275.8s)]
*  And then it's like not even a month later [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1278.68s)]
*  Alabama goes into vanderbilt and loses for the first time since 1984 man got their ass beat [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1281.72s)]
*  Vanderbilt scored 40 points on them. They like it was they didn't look into those points [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1287.24s)]
*  They beat their ass and it was just hilarious because first of all you also get to see bammer fans go crazy now [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1291.64s)]
*  Yeah, you say they've been they've lived an unprecedented ride for like the last 15 to 20 years [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1297.1599999999999s)]
*  And to see their faces and to see how they responded to losing to vandy in the first year post-saving it was hilarious [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1303.0s)]
*  So that's that that I had to put that in good one [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1309.24s)]
*  Right, I would also add for saban [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1311.8s)]
*  I loved when shane gailis made fun of him and saban didn't know how to handle it was one of my favorite tv moments [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1313.72s)]
*  In a while, right? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1319.56s)]
*  Because he he saban had no sense of humor about it. No, he was like, who the fuck is this guy? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1320.9199999999998s)]
*  He's saying we cheated and by the way, how does he know? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1326.84s)]
*  Say anything about charges anything he didn't say anything about a dust charge [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1332.68s)]
*  No, he was just talking he made a pain the players joke and save it was just fucking with it. Yeah [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1335.72s)]
*  Anyway, number three number three [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1341.4s)]
*  So, uh, if you are like me since I followed college football the idea of arizona state football has always been like man [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1343.72s)]
*  Arizona, why isn't arizona state any good? You know, they've got all they're in a [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1351.32s)]

*  Ain't gonna be in the problem [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1360.2s)]
*  And you know if you like me and you saw, you know the playboy edition of pack 10, you know [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1361.64s)]

*  So anyway [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1380.8400000000001s)]
*  But but man like arizona state was dope this year man, like you kind of see like oh man arizona state's good [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1386.5200000000002s)]
*  They might have like a future. They got a 34 year old coach. He can recruit, you know, they got a little outfit [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1392.68s)]
*  They're not going to get cam scatabot. Like I call that dude pocket grunk [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1397.88s)]
*  like I don't know if he's going to be good in the nfl or whatever, but um [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1401.48s)]
*  Like as a college character, he was perfect for like arizona state. I think as a fourth rounder, he's a must [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1405.4s)]
*  Like once you get past the second round you're just like throwing darts against the dartboard taking a flyer on them [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1412.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, yeah [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1417.64s)]

*  He can do a lot of different things on the football field. He might not have all the measurables [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1423.48s)]
*  I'm sure he'll run like four six. Oh, oh like yeah four six. Yeah, but but [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1426.92s)]
*  He is a football player. Yeah, he's so competitive. He's been good since he was probably what seven years old [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1432.76s)]
*  Always found found a way. Yeah, i'm in on that dude tape always matters more to me than the measurables [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1439.0s)]
*  Your tape always matters more [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1444.6000000000001s)]
*  It feels like he's gonna have some moment where somebody's starting running back will get hurt next year or year from now [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1445.96s)]
*  And that guy's gonna go in and have like 110 yards and be the big fantasy pickup [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1450.76s)]
*  Yeah, god only knows I mean that dude beasted against texas and like texas has all the athletes you could think of and he was [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1454.3600000000001s)]
*  He was awesome. All right number two [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1460.3600000000001s)]
*  number two [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1462.92s)]
*  Uh, this was the first heisman race in about a decade [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1463.88s)]
*  Where qb wasn't a serious contender and I love that because we had we could talk about travis hunter who I don't know [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1467.24s)]
*  I've never seen anything like that in college football like maybe maybe if you go down a level or something or you could say [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1473.48s)]
*  Oh, there's a guy that played, you know [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1479.4s)]
*  A thousand snaps in a season [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1482.44s)]
*  But i've never seen anybody do that and excel in the way the travis hunter did and like there was a game [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1483.88s)]
*  This year against ucf he had nine passes for 89 yards a touchdown [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1489.8s)]
*  A pass breakup an interception and he was on the field for 128 of 143 snaps in that game [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1494.76s)]
*  And i'm just like yo like I I don't know what more you could like people thought charles watson was amazing [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1500.6s)]
*  Because he played a few snaps at receiver [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1506.04s)]
*  Uh, no like travis hunter was doing something else totally and like the astin genti kid. I just [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1508.28s)]
*  Get me get on soapbox for a second [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1513.0s)]
*  If you think that astin genti got exposed against penn state you were stupid [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1515.32s)]
*  Like I literally think that you don't know ball because the dude like if you watch that defense and him like that guy [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1519.72s)]
*  It took everything in that penn state defense and they focused all their efforts on them because they because both boys the state couldn't pass [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1527.0s)]
*  And that dude still hammered out a hundred yards. There was a there was a 10 yard run [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1533.8s)]
*  Early in the fourth quarter with six penn state guys got a hand on it. Yeah. Yeah, man [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1538.52s)]
*  Yeah, so I love it. It felt like they were almost running like a goal line defense on him [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1543.8s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean he's getting crushed it was tough yards [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1548.2800000000002s)]
*  But every yard that he got he had to take it from the defense [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1550.5200000000002s)]
*  So he just he proved to me what a good back he was by his performance in that game. Yeah [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1553.88s)]
*  Abdu carter is supposedly a badass and he got hurt tackling astin genti in that game. You know what I'm saying? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1559.0800000000002s)]
*  So anyway, and uh, so he said so hunter's your favorite because obviously i'm moving [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1563.48s)]
*  I have the fourth pick in the draft with my beloved patriots [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1568.0400000000002s)]
*  Because we fucked up the last game of the season [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1571.0800000000002s)]
*  But carter is one of the guys the fan base is kind of we have a new coach [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1573.3200000000002s)]
*  He wants to build around the lines for like look at this guy [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1577.72s)]
*  I mean, it could be amazing pass pressure, but he's probably not going to be there at four [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1580.6s)]
*  I feel like he's going to go before that man. Yeah [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1583.72s)]
*  It feels like a will anderson situation right? He'll just go second [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1586.92s)]
*  I mean if he does get drafted high, I mean a lot of people say but my thing is this if you guys if will anderson [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1590.1200000000001s)]
*  Will anderson will campbell homer pick will campbell is still on the board when you guys are drafting [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1595.56s)]
*  You guys should take a left tackle or we yes, I think that's where we probably end up [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1599.56s)]
*  So you would play hunter d back or receiver? [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1603.4s)]
*  D back because it's so much harder to find guys with that skill set at that position [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1606.36s)]
*  You can get a receiver maybe not as [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1610.2s)]
*  Talented as travis, but you could get something a reasonable approximation on defense [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1613.1599999999999s)]
*  Though there's just not this just not cats like because it seems like the the move with him and maybe he ends up on the paths [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1618.2s)]
*  I don't know but cornerback [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1624.36s)]
*  And then special packages and maybe third and third and eight and up he comes in and he's like your third receiver [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1626.6s)]
*  and so maybe he's like [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1632.44s)]
*  10 offensive plays a game and then cornerback which even that would be like nobody's doing that now, right? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1634.2s)]
*  I mean look, I don't know what the feasibility is of him playing too much going both ways in the nfl [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1639.72s)]
*  From a wear and tear situation travis has been injured before. Yeah, so I don't know what the feasibility is of it [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1646.92s)]
*  I know if I was him [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1653.0800000000002s)]
*  I would want to play the receiver if I was the money him just for the money [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1655.0800000000002s)]
*  However, it is warm out. They're gonna want him. It's like 30 million a year at least [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1659.24s)]
*  Yeah, they're probably gonna want him to play [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1663.56s)]
*  Uh to play db, but if I was him I would want to find my way to it's so much fun [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1666.52s)]
*  I remember as a kid or I wasn't a kid. I guess it was in college when dian [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1671.72s)]
*  He was the d back but then every once in a while they would play him at receiver every time he came in [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1676.2s)]
*  It was so fucking exciting. It was like are they throwing bubble screen? [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1681.48s)]
*  He's just gonna throw a deep for him. It was like you couldn't take your ass off it. All right number one [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1684.36s)]
*  Number one, I just kind of obvious I mean it just there was just nothing that was going to indicate [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1688.6s)]
*  That michigan was even going to be competitive with ohio state [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1694.36s)]
*  It was like ohio state was a 19 and a half point favorite coming into that game. They had a 20 million dollar roster [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1697.1599999999999s)]
*  Michigan didn't even have their best player that game like cornerback will johnson. He was out that game [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1702.84s)]
*  And this was like they had it all set up there at home [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1708.76s)]
*  they can exact revenge on this team and just totally exercise all those demons and [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1711.32s)]
*  They lost to like the broke his dick offensive team. I mean I saw it with that like [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1717.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean that they can they cannot throw a forward pass on that team. It's it's the most [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1722.6799999999998s)]
*  It's one of the most embarrassing and shocking college football losses i've seen [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1728.04s)]
*  really [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1732.36s)]
*  Maybe maybe since michigan lost to appalachian state [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1733.6399999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah couple of decades before like you know, you know what I mean? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1738.6s)]
*  I [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1742.9199999999998s)]
*  struggle to explain [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1743.96s)]
*  How that game happened in the way that it with the stakes for ohio state with the stakes for ohio state with everything was [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1745.88s)]
*  With everything that was on the line for ohio state in terms of what they were playing for [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1753.16s)]
*  Structurally in terms of a college football championship, but also culturally [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1756.74s)]
*  Like the fact that they have been getting their asses kicked and hardball was there [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1761.24s)]
*  And this was the time for them to actually win that game 31 to 10 [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1765.0s)]
*  They couldn't fucking do it and not only that they got fucking manhandled and got their god damn manhood [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1768.44s)]
*  Taken by their arch rivals. I could not believe it. I love this theory that that loss was worse than [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1775.32s)]
*  The the high of winning a title, but let me tell you it's a really interesting seesaw and it diluted home [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1781.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean like they did it on your home field bro. I'll be honest with you [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1787.08s)]
*  I think that loss catapulted them into a national championship run. It made them mad [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1790.9199999999998s)]
*  They they got pissed off. They got embarrassed. They just have not played [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1796.4399999999998s)]
*  Anywhere nearly like the same team since the unbeatable behemoth that we were told ohio state was going to be this year [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1801.88s)]
*  They've played that way [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1809.16s)]
*  Subsequently to that loss so that says a lot about their staff and really a lot about their players in their program to be [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1810.66s)]
*  Honest with you. Do you guys like ohio state fans? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1815.96s)]
*  No, okay. No. All right. I have one thing to say and I have a theory and [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1818.92s)]
*  You know, I know concussion came out nine years ago, but I talked about this on the press box [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1824.04s)]
*  I think ohio state's quarterback got a concussion in the second quarter [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1828.44s)]
*  I think will howard got a concussion because he went he missed the play for a head [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1831.72s)]
*  They said they were looking at his head. He said he was okay [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1835.4s)]
*  He went back in the game and he never looked the same [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1837.56s)]
*  So that's just I know that football we've moved on from that like they're worrying about ct and everything [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1839.56s)]
*  But I kind of feel like that dude got a head injury [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1844.76s)]
*  I'm i'm i will always for the rest of my life think my home's got a concussion that bangles game [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1847.0s)]
*  At the end of the first half, right? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1851.72s)]
*  He was never the same after that moment and that was when they lost and I still can't believe they didn't make the super bowl [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1853.56s)]
*  Yeah, you know what you guys are i'm getting so sick in this conversation. It's bleeding heart liberal bullshit that i'm listening to [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DTWW6DKLU&t=1859.48s)]
