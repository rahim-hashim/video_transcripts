# The Vikings Get Rammed and Darnold Strikes Midnight With Cousin Sal | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4)
*  This is a quickie, guess the line segment coming off Rams, Vikings. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=0.0s)]
*  The good news, the Rams, an emotional win for, uh, for Los Angeles. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=5.4s)]
*  I guess you could feel it coming in the hour before the game with the emotional, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=9.44s)]
*  uh, performance of the national anthem. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  The Rams played great. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=16.76s)]
*  They played out of their minds. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=18.0s)]
*  And, uh, and yet I leave this game wondering what the hell happened [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=19.52s)]
*  in the Minnesota Vikings, where we were two weeks ago, first, where we are now. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=22.88s)]
*  It's one of the most stunning eight, nine day collapses I can [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=28.360000000000003s)]
*  remember of a football team. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=32.56s)]
*  I really, they, these guys won me over. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=33.92s)]
*  I really genuinely believed in them and they fell apart. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=35.94s)]
*  The whole division won me over the NFC North. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=39.36s)]
*  I went into this. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=42.44s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to, I'm going to key on this NFC North. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=43.160000000000004s)]
*  The Packers are going to be good. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=45.74s)]
*  The Vikings are going to go far or as far as they can before they're [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=46.88s)]
*  running to another team. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=49.52s)]
*  And now it's like, they're looking like the SEC a little bit for [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=50.58s)]
*  you college fans out there. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=53.6s)]
*  And yeah, I'm with you. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=55.22s)]
*  The Rams came out fighting proud of this team. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=56.44s)]
*  They brought their a game. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=59.04s)]
*  Like they had them together, right. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=60.36s)]
*  Mindset, but move them basically felt like the game was in Minneapolis. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=61.699999999999996s)]
*  Like, you know, they went to the sideline reporter and she's like, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=66.0s)]
*  yeah, a lot of Vikings fans. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=68.36s)]
*  I'm like, well, that doesn't seem fair, but they did a great job. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=69.52s)]
*  But yeah, you're right. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=72.96s)]
*  Like you and I were like, sign Sam Darnold easy two weeks ago. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=73.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=77.16s)]
*  I feel bad flip-flopping so much, but Jesus, what the hell is going on the last 10 days? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=77.46s)]
*  It's not a flip-flop. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  He had a whole body of evidence for the whole season where it looked like for [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=84.28s)]
*  whatever reason he was this year's late bloomer star QB and he had just come off [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=88.52s)]
*  that huge win over the Packers when he has one of the best games of his career. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=94.48s)]
*  They have the awesome NFL films video in the locker room after, right. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=98.86s)]
*  When they're all waiting, Darnold comes in and his teammates mob them. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=103.02s)]
*  They pick them up. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=106.88s)]
*  They show Kevin O'Connell, like almost like near tears, watching it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=108.4s)]
*  Great speeches. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=111.68s)]
*  Well, that's like, it was just now that you brought that up. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=113.08s)]
*  Like that really seems like it was not long ago. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=115.92s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=118.04s)]
*  Well, cause it wasn't, it was two weeks ago. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=118.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  And it just seemed like, man, this is such a great story. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=121.36s)]
*  The late bloomer Sam Darnold, and then he absolutely sucked in the Detroit game. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=124.36s)]
*  But I was willing to chuck it out to, Hey, it's a bad game. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=129.04s)]
*  This team's 14 and three. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=132.24s)]
*  They have a great track record. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=134.16s)]
*  Detroit was fired up. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=135.36s)]
*  They were home, but they couldn't block the Rams. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=136.4s)]
*  And the part that doesn't make sense to me, I was a little worried [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=139.28s)]
*  about their protection heading into the game just because of what it [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=142.0s)]
*  looked like against the lions. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=145.42s)]
*  But the Rams don't have a good defense. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=146.54s)]
*  The Rams defense was 26 and on a DVO way for defense. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=148.64s)]
*  They were the seventh worst defense in the league. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=153.68s)]
*  It's not like this was, you know, the 2000 Ravens. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=156.0s)]
*  Um, and they looked like the 2000 Ravens. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  So it was just a complete collapse. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=162.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=164.16s)]
*  This was supposed to be a rebuilding year, at least for the Rams defense. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=164.44s)]
*  You're right. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  Like, and then they get Jared verse and Colby Turner plays out of his mind this [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=168.44s)]
*  second year and a Colby Durant tonight, anyone named Colby and all the Colbys. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=172.08s)]
*  And it makes you think was Aaron Donald ever good? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  No, right. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=180.96s)]
*  Big legacy hit for him. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=182.28s)]
*  Should go to the hall of fame now. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=185.12s)]
*  Aaron Donald, Sam Darnold, maybe I like the guy's hemorrhaging money every [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=187.36s)]
*  time he drops back to pass. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=191.24s)]
*  Could he have opted out of the playoff game? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  Not just, not just his contract money, our money, cause we had them on teasers, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=195.08s)]
*  the Vikings and everything, but I guess that's, uh, that's what we get. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=199.52s)]
*  I guess. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  But as far as signing him again, we have to, we have to say no now, right? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  If you're the Vikings, we talked about yesterday, we were talking about QBs. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=207.12s)]
*  You'd rather have than Herbert. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=210.84s)]
*  And we were going down the list and I said to you, what about Sam Darnold? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=212.44s)]
*  Then you paused, which was my reaction as well. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=216.4s)]
*  And you're like, what's, what's wait to see what happens tomorrow. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=218.44s)]
*  And of course what happened was the worst possible game for him. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=223.96s)]
*  I was looking, so some of the stats for the Rams, had he into this game, they [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=227.28s)]
*  were 21st in the league in sacks. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=231.88s)]
*  They were 28th in the league and QB hits 26th and tackles for losses. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=234.52s)]
*  And they were sixth in QB hurries. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=240.04000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=241.56s)]
*  So that's the one thing where he's like, Oh, I can kind of see it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  The Vikings were 23rd in sacks, given up, uh, 20th QB hits, 24th QB hurries, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=245.20000000000002s)]
*  24 tackles for loss. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=251.28s)]
*  So there were signs that their offensive line might not be that great, but nothing [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=252.52s)]
*  could have prepared anybody for what happened. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=257.76s)]
*  Like he was just under attack and he reverted back into old school, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=259.72s)]
*  seeing ghosts, Sam Darnold. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=264.12s)]
*  It was like Jets, pats, Sam Darnold. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=265.44s)]
*  And now you mentioned the money thing. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=267.72s)]
*  I don't know what you do if you're the Vikings. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=269.76s)]
*  And we're going to kill Sam Darnold and we already have, and we'll probably do [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=271.96000000000004s)]
*  another 10 minutes, uh, doing so. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=274.72s)]
*  But yeah, I think he was sacked nine times. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=276.8s)]
*  He was sacked six times in the first half and like the next gen stats, like [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=279.04s)]
*  can kind of now tell you which, which sacks are the quarterback's fault. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=282.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=286.28s)]
*  I think like five or six of them were his fault because anything over like four [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  seconds is the quarterback's fault. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=290.79999999999995s)]
*  So, yeah, we have next gen stats and we also have Trey Aikman who can tell no [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=293.08s)]
*  lies when he's watching a quarterback performance that he's not enjoying that [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=298.4s)]
*  much and he just couldn't a few times. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=301.79999999999995s)]
*  He's just like, I, Joey, he has a good pocket there. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=304.52s)]
*  I don't know what, I don't know what, why that happened the way it did, because [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=308.24s)]
*  the pockets would be steps up. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=312.76s)]
*  He's got plays. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=314.04s)]
*  Um, I don't know. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=315.48s)]
*  He just, the moment got too big for him, which was what happened last week too. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=316.56s)]
*  And then he trick him. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=320.64s)]
*  So now there's this whole domino effect now because what the lines did to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=321.72s)]
*  Minnesota last week and we're like, little lions are back, their defense is back. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  But then you watch the Vikings can't block again this week. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=332.0s)]
*  Darnold stinks again this week. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=334.48s)]
*  So when you look forward to guess the lions, we have this Rams game. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=336.44s)]
*  I have no idea what to make of their performance that bite. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=340.44s)]
*  Like is their defense for real? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=343.08s)]
*  Is it not for real? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=344.32s)]
*  What's going on there? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=345.08s)]
*  And then the lions who looked so awesome last week and we're all like their [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=345.8s)]
*  defense, maybe it's back. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=349.04s)]
*  They had a bye week. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=351.12s)]
*  Now you see the Vikings can't block and it's like, well, maybe it's not back. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=352.32s)]
*  Maybe Washington will be able to move the ball against the trade. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=355.2s)]
*  This just made me more confused about round two. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=357.68s)]
*  So it made me confused by round two. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=359.64s)]
*  It made me confused about which quarterbacks are good. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=361.96000000000004s)]
*  If the, the Herbert thing you brought up and like what Minnesota, this is [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=364.88000000000005s)]
*  good for the fans though, right? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=368.28000000000003s)]
*  This kind of opens things up. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=369.52000000000004s)]
*  That would have been boring if the Vikings just resigned. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=370.72s)]
*  Sam Darnold gave them a big number, but they're like top seven in cap space. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=373.32000000000005s)]
*  I think like a hundred and they took their medicine with a dead cap with [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=377.72s)]
*  cousins and the Nell Hunter, I think this year, but they're like a, I think [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=381.12s)]
*  they have like 160 million free and they have to start McCarthy now, but yeah, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=384.68s)]
*  you're right going forward. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=389.24s)]
*  I don't know what it means for any of these teams. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=390.20000000000005s)]
*  Well, can't they can franchise tag Darnold though. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=391.72s)]
*  Yes, it would just be for a big salary. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=394.12s)]
*  But how much is that then? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=396.59999999999997s)]
*  Is that 40 or it's not worth it now. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=397.91999999999996s)]
*  It's definitely not worth it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=400.28s)]
*  I think if Darnold plays well against Detroit, they lose to Detroit by like [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=401.76s)]
*  three and then they play the Rams, the Rams squeak it out, but he's fine in that. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=407.12s)]
*  He's looking at at least the Baker Mayfield money, which I think [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=412.32s)]
*  it was like three for a hundred range. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=415.32s)]
*  Now I had a whole losers winners thing I wanted to do. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=417.52s)]
*  Um, he was, he was the biggest individual loser. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=421.36s)]
*  Surrey says 41 million for the franchise thing. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=425.24s)]
*  So he's the biggest loser because I don't know what the free agent money is [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=428.8s)]
*  going to be. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=433.88s)]
*  Well, let's see, how much did you and I lose on that Vikings adjusted? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=434.2s)]
*  I mean, I guess he's the biggest loser, but I did the anchor, the anchor [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=438.08s)]
*  parlay with four games and I ended up just splitting them. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=442.96s)]
*  So it's just like all that work for nothing. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=445.64s)]
*  I lost them. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=448.52s)]
*  The chargers lost on the Vikings, one on the other, but I was thinking [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=449.03999999999996s)]
*  Steeler fans, Raider fans, saints fans, Sam Darnold is now in their life with [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=453.91999999999996s)]
*  rumors, right? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=459.56s)]
*  Those are the three teams. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=461.71999999999997s)]
*  I don't think the giants just because of the jets pedigree, I think they would [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=463.0s)]
*  stay away, but Steelers Raiders saints, I think are three possibilities. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=466.76s)]
*  I don't know why they could franchise them for a year and do the whole, Hey, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=471.03999999999996s)]
*  we're not sure is JJ McCarthy is even going to be ready for September. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=474.40000000000003s)]
*  They showed Daniel Jones a couple of times, like he's an option. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=480.24s)]
*  We've seen Daniel Jones. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=482.96000000000004s)]
*  They're not going to, it can't be Daniel Jones. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=484.16s)]
*  I just don't know. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=486.40000000000003s)]
*  What are they, there's one way to look at it is we're not going to do better [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=487.2s)]
*  than 14 wins, right? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=490.48s)]
*  I think we can get us to 14 wins, but it's just this whole January thing. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=492.64s)]
*  That seems to be a mess. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=496.72s)]
*  The other way is to look at it as let's see what we did with this McCarthy, with [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=498.48s)]
*  our first round pick, see what we got out of them. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=502.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=505.08s)]
*  They obviously believed in them. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=505.32s)]
*  They took them really high. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=506.6s)]
*  You had bad luck with an injury, but before the injury, they were all excited [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=509.08s)]
*  about what he looked like in the preseason. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=512.04s)]
*  Um, so Donald's the biggest loser, but the, the runner up and maybe even the [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=514.16s)]
*  winner is the Vikings fans who just, you know, I've mentioned my buddy Jeff a [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=519.2s)]
*  couple of times he's just, he's in, I told you so mode. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=523.52s)]
*  He's like, I told you, this is what we do. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=526.2s)]
*  This is what he's just, this is preordained. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=528.28s)]
*  Not only that they're going to lose, but it was going to be a complete embarrassment. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=530.96s)]
*  This was this team won more games than any other Vikings team ever, except for [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=534.4s)]
*  the 98 team that went 15 and one and lost in the NFC title game, the 69 team went [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=539.28s)]
*  12 and two lost the Superbowl. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=545.28s)]
*  The 73 team went 12 and two lost Superbowl. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=546.92s)]
*  75 team went 11, two and one lost Superbowl. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=549.52s)]
*  The 17 team, 13 and three, they lost that NFC title game in, uh, in, in, in, uh, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=552.68s)]
*  Philly, whatever it was with Philly. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=559.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=561.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=562.0400000000001s)]
*  Um, but this was one of the best Vikings teams, at least from a regular season [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=562.8000000000001s)]
*  standpoint of the last 60 years and just goes out ignominiously, like they [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=567.72s)]
*  couldn't even score 10 points. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=572.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=574.12s)]
*  This is bad. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=574.84s)]
*  It's shocking. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=575.5600000000001s)]
*  It's tough. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=576.52s)]
*  And the coaching, they got out coached too. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=577.12s)]
*  Like the guy who's going to win coach of the year, Kevin O'Connell got out coached. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=579.24s)]
*  It didn't take a lot. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=582.96s)]
*  I was kind of, I would have liked to have seen them call that Stafford play differently. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=584.32s)]
*  I know you and I having money on the Vikings would have also, but with that [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=588.32s)]
*  forward passing, the thing that was returned for a touchdown, they called it [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=591.84s)]
*  a fumble initially, and then they said Stafford. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=595.24s)]
*  I think you have to do a little more than pretend you're sprinkling salt on eggs. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=597.88s)]
*  It move your foot. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=603.32s)]
*  Your hands got to go a little more forward than that. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=604.24s)]
*  I mean, it's, it should be like a 30 yard penalty when you do that. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=607.08s)]
*  If you're going down on a sack and you just whip the butt, it's like [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=610.7600000000001s)]
*  beyond an intentional grounding. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=613.5200000000001s)]
*  I personally think it should be, I think that should be a fumble when you're just [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=615.5999999999999s)]
*  dumping the ball because you're going to take a sack, but you're not even dumping [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=619.12s)]
*  it anywhere near anybody. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=622.48s)]
*  Um, it was the key play of the game because it felt like the Vikings [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=624.24s)]
*  were going to have momentum. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=627.0s)]
*  There's defense in general though. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=628.04s)]
*  The Rams played it perfectly. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=629.3199999999999s)]
*  They came out in the first quarter. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=630.5999999999999s)]
*  Stafford started out nine for nine. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=632.1999999999999s)]
*  They could anticipate every single thing that was happening. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=634.24s)]
*  This was the people that were making the case for the Rams heading into this game [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=636.9599999999999s)]
*  was not only did they win earlier in the year, but Stafford was good against the [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=640.52s)]
*  Blitz. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=645.16s)]
*  He's good at, he's such a smart QB. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=645.5600000000001s)]
*  He's good at reading stuff and everything got born out. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=647.6s)]
*  I thought the Vikings were able to run the ball better, but in general, like a, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=650.6s)]
*  the 26 DVOA defense should not be dominant. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=654.44s)]
*  I know they had a couple of games when guys were missing, but for the most part, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=657.36s)]
*  like that makes no sense to me. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=660.6s)]
*  It's a team that got carved up multiple times this year, you know, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=662.5600000000001s)]
*  never could get Jefferson going. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=666.72s)]
*  You know, let's see a one-on-one play to Jefferson. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=668.4399999999999s)]
*  The Addison drops everything thrown his way. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=671.16s)]
*  It's, it gets ridiculous. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=673.36s)]
*  And again, at least half those sacks were, uh, Donald's fault. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=675.28s)]
*  So winners, JJ McCarthy, Sean McVeigh, another great win. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=679.12s)]
*  He's got eight playoff wins now. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=685.48s)]
*  Plus the super bowl. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=687.9599999999999s)]
*  They made the playoffs in six of eight of his, uh, post-seasons. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=688.9599999999999s)]
*  He's only been a coach for eight years and just coached the pants off of Kevin [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=692.72s)]
*  O'Connell, who's going to win a really awkward coach of the year award in about, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=698.16s)]
*  I don't know, whenever they have that NFL honors thing, uh, kill them, not only [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=701.64s)]
*  kill them, but, oh, the, the, the Vikes were down 18 with 10 minutes left and [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=706.0s)]
*  were running the Donovan McNabb, Pat's Eagles, Superbowl offense, just long [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=711.28s)]
*  huddles before every play and nowhere to see it all. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=716.24s)]
*  It was like, they really quit. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=718.9599999999999s)]
*  It was borderline Roberto Duran, no mas, no mas. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=720.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=724.04s)]
*  Buck, even Joe Buck and Aikman were like, does this team know they're down 18? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=724.48s)]
*  They're running on second and sixth quarter. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=728.08s)]
*  What are you guys doing? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=731.6s)]
*  Very strange. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=732.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=733.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=733.84s)]
*  Uh, yeah. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=734.64s)]
*  McVeigh McVeigh is a gigantic winner. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=735.56s)]
*  And so LA football fans too. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=737.96s)]
*  I mean, really just to get this team ready, bringing their pets out and their [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=740.4s)]
*  family and bringing them out over there. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=743.48s)]
*  And now it's like, Todd, I mean, we'll talk about the next game against [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=745.68s)]
*  Philly, but they're flying home to LA. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=748.88s)]
*  They don't know if they're going to be able to practice in their facility, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=750.72s)]
*  depending on the air quality, and then they have to go all the way to Philly. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=753.52s)]
*  It's going to be interesting to see if they can keep this momentum going. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=757.16s)]
*  Rams fans, huge winner. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=761.68s)]
*  This is such a likable team. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=764.6s)]
*  This was not supposed to be a team post Aaron Darnold that, um, you know, they, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=766.52s)]
*  when they were one and four, they were talking about, could Cup be, I never [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=771.76s)]
*  believed those stories, but there were trade rumors about Cup and could [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=775.56s)]
*  Stafford be potentially available. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=779.16s)]
*  Um, and all of a sudden now they're heading into the second round again. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=781.28s)]
*  It's a pretty, pretty beatable Eagles team. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=784.1999999999999s)]
*  Hench made a good joke. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=786.8s)]
*  Our buddy, Hench, she said, um, their crowd was so good because Glendale is a [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=788.12s)]
*  shorter ride for the Rams fans than SoFi Stadium. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=793.0s)]
*  Really good, really good inside joke. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=795.9599999999999s)]
*  Or is that accurate? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=798.6s)]
*  I think that's, I think that's, I think you're being serious. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=799.4399999999999s)]
*  Six hours to Glendale, five hours to SoFi. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=801.64s)]
*  Close. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=805.16s)]
*  Uh, losers, the Eagles. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=806.4s)]
*  I, I, it went from, oh man, I don't want to see the [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=812.4s)]
*  Vikings too. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=815.96s)]
*  Oh Jesus. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=816.96s)]
*  This Rams team, they're just cagey. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=817.76s)]
*  They're like one of those old boxers. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=819.6s)]
*  They've lost a couple of times. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=821.32s)]
*  They're like 37, but they might be 40 and they just kind of know what to do in the [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=823.32s)]
*  ring and you don't want to fight them. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=827.72s)]
*  They don't want a lot. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=830.08s)]
*  They don't win a lot of these matchups, right? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=830.96s)]
*  They don't win the coaching matchup. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=833.4000000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=835.64s)]
*  I guess they win the running back. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=835.96s)]
*  I, I coach or QB, they lose both of those. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=837.36s)]
*  QB is going to pass for 148 yards and you know, he's going to get pushed [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=840.1600000000001s)]
*  forward a couple of yards here and there. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=843.48s)]
*  Um, I feel like the defensive intensity for the ramp, you know, the receivers are [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=845.6s)]
*  not off on the sideline reading, uh, Dushkaevsky. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=849.88s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=853.28s)]
*  Like, I feel like, I think it's really tough. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=854.36s)]
*  This is a tough matchup and nobody wants them to win. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=857.32s)]
*  Outdoors, Philadelphia, probably not warm. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=860.72s)]
*  Stafford and cold weather. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=866.52s)]
*  There's some playoff manifesto stuff with this too. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=870.04s)]
*  There's always the, one of the best playoff manifesto rules that I have is [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=872.4s)]
*  the round two team that looked a little too good in round one, everybody's a [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=877.48s)]
*  little too excited about them. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=881.12s)]
*  The Rams definitely qualify for that. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=882.36s)]
*  And conversely, the Eagles not looking that great in round one. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=884.28s)]
*  So there's, and I think that's going to be reflected in the, uh, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=888.76s)]
*  but this opens up some nice, and we talk about narratives all the time. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=891.52s)]
*  Like that NFC championship is going to be funny the way you get [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=895.0s)]
*  golf against Stafford, right? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=898.12s)]
*  As long as the Eagles are out, I think it's fun. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=900.28s)]
*  You got golf against Stafford or you get Jayden Daniels against Stafford and the [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=902.64s)]
*  LA, you know, the LA team and the nation rooting hard for LA, whatever, against [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=906.24s)]
*  the rookie quarterback who's come from nothing. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=911.12s)]
*  Um, yeah. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=913.4s)]
*  So just step aside Eagles. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=914.36s)]
*  Did you hear from any Eagles fans today who were like, you guys are [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=916.5999999999999s)]
*  a little too hard on us yesterday. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=920.0s)]
*  We want to play a game. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=921.4s)]
*  Oh, you did? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=922.8399999999999s)]
*  Cause I didn't at all. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=923.3199999999999s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=924.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=925.4399999999999s)]
*  The Eagles fans I heard from were like, yeah, you guys nailed it. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=925.64s)]
*  I was fucking pissed after that game. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=928.44s)]
*  I'm still mad. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=931.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=932.4000000000001s)]
*  Well, there's always that, but the, you know, Eagle fans tend to hate. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=932.6800000000001s)]
*  You'll always find a few of the just going to hate you for saying [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=936.2800000000001s)]
*  anything about them, good or bad. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=939.0s)]
*  That's what it was. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=941.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=942.5200000000001s)]
*  Guess the lines. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=942.72s)]
*  You already beat me. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=943.36s)]
*  The big question, the media was talking all day. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=944.2s)]
*  You even going to play your starters here. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=946.32s)]
*  What happened is you're in the week 18 Kansas city chiefs thing. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=948.12s)]
*  Do you just sit everybody trying not to get hurt? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=951.0400000000001s)]
*  Do you try to give me false hope to do the Buffalo Bills where you tank the [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=953.5200000000001s)]
*  game to make me feel better about where I am heading into next week? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=957.16s)]
*  I'm going to be down one for the first time since 1892. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=960.4399999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=964.4s)]
*  That's a long time. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=964.76s)]
*  I thought before that, uh, well, I'll let my words speak for themselves here. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=965.76s)]
*  LA at Philly 3 PM Eastern Sunday. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=970.4s)]
*  I'm going to guess, uh, Rams by 42 and a half. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=974.12s)]
*  That's my official guests because it doesn't matter. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=978.9599999999999s)]
*  I think, I think I'm going to win this. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=981.24s)]
*  I have, uh, Eagles minus six and a half. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=983.16s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=986.48s)]
*  You got it. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=986.8000000000001s)]
*  Uh, you know what it was six and a half. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=987.4s)]
*  It went down to five and a half, but you are closer. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=989.2s)]
*  Wait, let me see. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=991.52s)]
*  Yes, you are closer. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=992.24s)]
*  So what did you have 42 and a half? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=993.24s)]
*  No, I actually, in real life, I would have said like three. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=996.36s)]
*  I don't, I, um, I guess they're just counting on this just being too much, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=999.52s)]
*  too much of a story for the Rams. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1004.24s)]
*  So we ended up, I remember looking at the round one lines on like Wednesday, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1006.9200000000001s)]
*  Thursday, whatever, like just looking to distract from any possible way. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1012.16s)]
*  I'd be like, where are the lines at? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1016.6s)]
*  And I remember thinking like, I know we're going to have three underdogs. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1017.92s)]
*  I have no idea who the three underdogs are going to be that actually advance. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1021.08s)]
*  And it ended up being Houston, Washington and the Rams, two home teams, two home [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1024.6s)]
*  dogs, which used to be like a playoff. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1030.92s)]
*  Always take a home dog. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1033.6s)]
*  Don't even think twice. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1034.76s)]
*  And then the Washington team in a game that was, I could see either of these [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1036.28s)]
*  teams winning these games. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1039.96s)]
*  Why not take the points? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1040.96s)]
*  So it all makes sense in retrospect, but on Wednesday I was like, I could see [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1042.68s)]
*  all six favorites winning and those were the three shortest underdogs, right? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1045.92s)]
*  They're all between two and a half and three, right? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1050.44s)]
*  So yeah, you wouldn't have even saw our money line. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1053.16s)]
*  Parlay still would have hit and that would have been the way to do it. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1055.6000000000001s)]
*  I thought the Broncos with that plus eight and a half, nine, whatever it was, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1058.92s)]
*  had a chance to keep things around. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1061.88s)]
*  And then the first quarter it's in the way and then the bills pulled away. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1065.04s)]
*  The Packers were another one. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1067.88s)]
*  Six minutes. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1069.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1069.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1070.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1070.48s)]
*  Um, so it turned out to be the three short odds, two home dogs, and we ended up [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1070.72s)]
*  300 dogs advancing round one. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1074.68s)]
*  So the AFC is the same exactly the same as last year, right? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1076.48s)]
*  These are the same four that advanced. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1079.44s)]
*  Houston, Kansas city, Baltimore, Buffalo. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1081.3200000000002s)]
*  Well, we talked yesterday. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1084.52s)]
*  I was saying that that Baltimore game that's in the Tic Tac zone. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1085.6000000000001s)]
*  Um, right. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1089.68s)]
*  I thought it was going to flip. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1090.64s)]
*  It was yesterday. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1092.0800000000002s)]
*  It was Buffalo minus one and a half. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1093.0s)]
*  I predicted to you, I think it's going to flip. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1095.68s)]
*  I think Baltimore is going to be one and a half. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1097.56s)]
*  It already happened. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1099.3999999999999s)]
*  Baltimore is one and a half. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1100.48s)]
*  So since we did it yesterday, Baltimore is minus one and a half Buffalo. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1102.08s)]
*  Philly is now minus five and a half on Fandl. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1105.28s)]
*  Uh, Detroit is minus eight and a half against Washington. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1108.6399999999999s)]
*  And then Casey is still minus seven and a half and everybody and their [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1112.6s)]
*  brother is teasing them with Ohio state. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1117.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1119.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1120.1599999999999s)]
*  And, and they're probably going to take two of those three mid range fair, five [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1120.44s)]
*  and a half, seven and a half, eight and a half and put them together, probably [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1124.12s)]
*  the Saturday games, right? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1126.64s)]
*  No, but people want to win money Saturday and then go over Sunday. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1127.68s)]
*  So that that's going to be a popular Moneyline parlay Detroit and Kansas city. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1130.5200000000002s)]
*  But as far as Buffalo goes, I, you know, and I might even end up taking Baltimore, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1134.88s)]
*  but that is entirely, entirely disrespectful to bills. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1138.6000000000001s)]
*  They, they need, can we get Lewis K to step in as their publicist? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1142.48s)]
*  They need a new publicist. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1146.2s)]
*  If that fricking team can't lay points at home, I don't care who they're playing. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1147.3200000000002s)]
*  They're damn good. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1151.8000000000002s)]
*  They can't be getting any point in a half. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1152.76s)]
*  I think it goes down to the Ravens had five losses and you could easily just [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1154.8s)]
*  examine all of them and be like, ah, they actually should add one loss. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1161.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1164.72s)]
*  They were the number one team in DVO way. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1165.3200000000002s)]
*  They look like they've gotten better as the years gone along, especially on [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1167.88s)]
*  defense defense was the big hole with them. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1171.72s)]
*  The first 10 weeks have flipped and I think it's the right line. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1174.1200000000001s)]
*  And I'll, I'll be honest. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1177.2s)]
*  I've already put money on Baltimore. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1178.52s)]
*  I believe you. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1181.52s)]
*  I grabbed it because I was worried it was going to get to like minus two and a [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1182.3999999999999s)]
*  half, something like that. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1185.44s)]
*  I just think they're, I think Buffalo's defense is going to have a lot of [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1186.56s)]
*  trouble stopping them, but we'll see. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1190.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to look at it more. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1191.6399999999999s)]
*  There's going to be some narrative that nobody believes in us. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1192.84s)]
*  If that starts drifting around Buffalo, I'm going to get nervous. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1195.04s)]
*  Do you think like, I know this is a regular season vote, but we saw Kevin [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1198.08s)]
*  O'Connell like, ah, and you said it now it's going to be a weird coach of the [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1202.04s)]
*  year or it's like the Dirk the whiskey 2007 MVP. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1205.96s)]
*  That was the old timer. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1208.8s)]
*  He'd already been knocked out of the playoffs. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1209.76s)]
*  And they're like, here's your, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1211.4s)]
*  could there be an executive goodell decision or whoever makes this decision, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1212.76s)]
*  give the voters their votes back. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1216.3200000000002s)]
*  I'm like, all right, we're going to give you one more game. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1218.0s)]
*  Nope. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1220.16s)]
*  You wouldn't do it. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1220.92s)]
*  I mean, it's a regular season award. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1222.0800000000002s)]
*  I know, but if one of them throws four interceptions, he was the best [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1224.72s)]
*  coach of the regular season. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1227.3600000000001s)]
*  Now it's like Sam Darnold was so bad those last two weeks. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1228.6000000000001s)]
*  Maybe that in both. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1231.4s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1232.44s)]
*  That's true. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1233.44s)]
*  How did he get it done? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1234.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I can't believe we fell for Sam Darnold. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1235.2s)]
*  Well, that's a fricking, that's a great division, aside from what the bears [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1239.0s)]
*  put forth and they won 14 games. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1243.84s)]
*  Like there's no, it's hard to get around that. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1246.44s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1248.48s)]
*  There was a number of times during the season when I felt myself being like, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1250.6399999999999s)]
*  you know what, I'm starting to believe in this guy. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1254.72s)]
*  And then it was that, uh, that Arizona game week 13, he lit up Atlanta. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1257.32s)]
*  He lit up Chicago. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1262.28s)]
*  He had a really nice win at Seattle. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1263.6s)]
*  And then that Green Bay game, they won, they won nine straight games and he was [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1265.3999999999999s)]
*  getting better during the streak. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1270.36s)]
*  And he really, I believed I don't, I feel burned. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1271.8799999999999s)]
*  You know why? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1276.52s)]
*  Because we go on the podcast and it's not fun to just keep telling people, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1277.12s)]
*  all right, just be careful with this guy. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1280.9199999999998s)]
*  It's not fun. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1283.56s)]
*  Well, maybe we should just do the podcast and just be like chiefs, Ravens, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1284.6s)]
*  Bills, Eagles, Lyons, like we just should have never wavered from those five teams. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1288.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1293.4399999999998s)]
*  And so, you know, grand or scale probably just should take the [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1293.72s)]
*  chiefs the rest of the way. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1296.96s)]
*  But yeah, Sam Darnold is 27. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1298.16s)]
*  Uh, we saw what he looked like at 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, but we [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1300.8s)]
*  probably should have stayed with that. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1304.88s)]
*  I really liked Sam Darnold. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1306.44s)]
*  Like I really thought that video of, of how much his teammates loved him. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1307.72s)]
*  I was in, I was like, man, this guy finally, it's like a rescue dog. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1311.2s)]
*  He finally found a home and now he might be your new New Orleans Saints quarterback. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1314.52s)]
*  Poor Sam. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMoy7eOqa4&t=1319.88s)]
