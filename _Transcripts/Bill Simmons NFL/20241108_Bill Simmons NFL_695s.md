# Where Will Bill Belichick Coach Next? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [November 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I)
*  Have you talked yourself into Belichick or Vrabel yet? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=0.0s)]
*  I can't tell you how ready I am to hand this entire team to build Belichick. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=3.64s)]
*  I can't even begin to describe how quickly, how quickly I would hand, uh, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=7.12s)]
*  Dexter Lawrence to build Belichick. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=12.36s)]
*  Like sprint. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=15.24s)]
*  Give me, yeah, whatever. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=16.6s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=17.96s)]
*  Belichick is on a six month trying to prove to everybody what an awesome [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=19.0s)]
*  personality he is and that it's actually not true that he's a curmudgeon. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=25.28s)]
*  And here's how much I know about football and look how personable I am. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=29.2s)]
*  Also, he can get one of these jobs in February. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=32.88s)]
*  I think he likes day ball. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=35.32s)]
*  I think that part's probably awkward. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=36.4s)]
*  And it feels like for the giants, it would have to be a complete house cleaning. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=38.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=41.96s)]
*  It's like they've gotten rid of everybody. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=42.2s)]
*  I still feel like Jacksonville is going to be the team for him. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=44.68s)]
*  I think that that's, that makes a lot of sense because the Jaguars, I mean, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=47.8s)]
*  they did it with Tom Cawthon, right? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=50.72s)]
*  They gave Tom Cawthon total control of the organization. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=51.84s)]
*  I think they're building a new arena. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  Like you just be like, you hand the franchise to this guy. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=56.64s)]
*  He's a legend. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  Here's our new arena. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=60.88s)]
*  Here's Bill Belichick. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=61.84s)]
*  Here's Trevor Lawrence. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=62.88s)]
*  How's that make sense to you? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  It would make more sense to me if he was a big golf guy because there's an [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=65.72s)]
*  incredible resort, sea Island is right. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=68.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=70.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=70.84s)]
*  You know, like less than an hour away. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=71.08s)]
*  Like respectfully, respectfully, I'll say this. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=73.32s)]
*  It means you have to go live in Jacksonville. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=77.84s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=80.48s)]
*  I think that was like Talladega nights with all the respect, you know, you just [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=81.44s)]
*  say whatever you want. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=84.32s)]
*  Anytime respectfully or all the respect is used. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=85.0s)]
*  Ruiz called out the Belichick Jacksonville thing. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=87.88s)]
*  I don't know how many weeks ago on this pod, the other one would, which would be [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=90.36s)]
*  fun from a narrative standpoint is Vegas with, um, just like him and Brady being [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  reunited in some weird way with no craft, but [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  Belichick being Brady, Brady, having Brady be his boss. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=101.56s)]
*  I don't know if that's going to happen. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  I have a question for you. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  That's a fun narrative one. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=107.08s)]
*  I, I can't imagine after what Belichick went through with Cam Newton and with [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=108.36s)]
*  Mac Jones, um, that he would go to a team that didn't have a quarterback. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=113.68s)]
*  Like, look at what happened with Harbaugh. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=118.12s)]
*  Harbaugh went to a team that had good players and a good market with Justin [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=119.48s)]
*  Herbert as his quarterback and he had an offensive line and he could immediately [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=124.44000000000001s)]
*  make that team pretty good. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  I think Belichick's too smart to be like, ah, we'll figure out the quarterback. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=130.44s)]
*  He knows. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=133.60000000000002s)]
*  Here's my question for you. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  What do you think he wants? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=136.08s)]
*  Because this is like a Phil Jackson thing where he kind of wants control, but like, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=137.0s)]
*  you know, he's kind of like a check as you're going out. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=140.28s)]
*  Do you think that there's like real motivation and that like, we'll see a [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=142.36s)]
*  level of energy we probably have never seen from a 70 year old coach? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=145.64000000000001s)]
*  I think, uh, chip on the shoulder combined with the wins record. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=148.72000000000003s)]
*  So he's got to go to a place where he can put together wins. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=153.44000000000003s)]
*  I don't think he wants to rebuild something from the bottom, but like 20, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=155.84s)]
*  18 wins in two years. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=159.08s)]
*  Like that's, that doesn't sound great to me. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  Like if he's like, oh, we've eat out three, 10 win seasons and lost in the wild [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=162.16000000000003s)]
*  card round and then he retires. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=167.28000000000003s)]
*  I don't know if that's like necessarily awesome for someone who has literally [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=168.60000000000002s)]
*  zero track record of any of his coaches having any kind of like legacy whatsoever. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=171.92s)]
*  Dallas. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  That you beat me to it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=178.56s)]
*  Why not? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  Zero chance. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=180.56s)]
*  I would, I would, I would, I would, no zero chance. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=181.23999999999998s)]
*  I'll like gamble on it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=184.11999999999998s)]
*  I will serve, I'll buy you a beer chop. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=185.6s)]
*  I will serve drinks at your draft. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=188.51999999999998s)]
*  Like, like I'll, I'll be like Cabana boy if that happens. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  I don't have any drafts. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=194.64s)]
*  No, like, like basically like Dallas Cowboys. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this great story from Kaelin Collar at ESPN this week, but [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  basically like just to give you a window into Jerry Jones's mind, they have tours [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=200.64s)]
*  going through the facility just to like, like Mark Parsons is limping with his [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=204.64s)]
*  family through the Cowboys facility. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=208.16s)]
*  There's like visitors who paid, they're making like 1200 bucks off this to like, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=209.4s)]
*  we'll have people watching. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=213.28s)]
*  There's like fans like, oh my God, Michael Parsons doesn't look good. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  Like it's the opposite of the Kremlin. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=216.68s)]
*  And then the whole reason Jerry screwed up is because Jimmy Johnson got all the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=218.0s)]
*  credit for the cow 90s Cowboys. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  Jimmy Johnson was the, how about the, how about them Cowboys? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=223.32s)]
*  Jimmy Johnson got all the credit. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=225.84s)]
*  The entire last 20 years has been Jerry trying to get his own credit. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=227.12s)]
*  That's why he didn't want Bill Parcells. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=230.0s)]
*  Sounds like Bob Kraft. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=231.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=232.68s)]
*  Like, yeah, exactly. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=232.96s)]
*  It's like that, like the Bob Kraft making the dock. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=233.88s)]
*  That's every move Jerry's made for 20 years has been like that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=236.08s)]
*  That's and Parcells is not going to tell Belichick to take that job. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=238.6s)]
*  And I, I, there's no way that Jerry can let Belichick get the credit, make [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=241.88s)]
*  decisions it's like Jerry wants to get attention and get all the control and all [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=247.28s)]
*  the attention for having control. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=251.68s)]
*  I would be, I think Belichick would sit out another season before he took the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=253.28s)]
*  Dallas job. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=257.2s)]
*  The credit thing is so weird to me when people like Kraft hired Belichick. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=257.71999999999997s)]
*  That's all he did. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=262.52s)]
*  There's no other thing he gets credit for. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=264.36s)]
*  He kept the team in New England instead of them moving to St. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=266.0s)]
*  Louis. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=268.59999999999997s)]
*  He didn't move them to Hartford and he hired Bob Belichick. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=269.28s)]
*  There's no other thing I can point to that he did other than be cheap the last 10 [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=271.96s)]
*  years. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=275.59999999999997s)]
*  Jerry hired Jimmy Johnson. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=276.47999999999996s)]
*  He gets credit for that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=278.0s)]
*  He built that awesome stadium. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=279.15999999999997s)]
*  Great. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=281.12s)]
*  But other than that, they've just been another football team the last 20 years. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=282.32s)]
*  House went through this with Snyder. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=285.44s)]
*  These guys that come in and think people care about the owner. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=286.64s)]
*  They don't, they just want the team to be good. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=289.28s)]
*  That's it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=291.08s)]
*  Can I, can I read you a stat that might color this conversation? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=293.04s)]
*  Please. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=298.12s)]
*  Bill Belichick has 302 wins. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=300.28s)]
*  How many do you think Andy Reid is behind right now? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=303.88s)]
*  15, 20. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=307.88s)]
*  He's at 266. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=311.4s)]
*  So he's 36% of the team. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=312.52s)]
*  He's at 266. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=314.0s)]
*  So he's 36 behind, but you figure six, seven more, right? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=315.08s)]
*  There are eight, no, they get to 15 and two. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=321.84s)]
*  So he'll be at 273. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=324.2s)]
*  He'll be within 30 by the end of the year. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=326.4s)]
*  And he is 1958 and Belichick is 1952. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=329.04s)]
*  He's six years younger. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=336.96s)]
*  That's another reason. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=338.84s)]
*  I don't, that's why I don't think he goes to like, Oh, I've taken over the Panthers. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=339.68s)]
*  It's, he's got to go to a team that he can actually win games the way Harbaugh did. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=343.56s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=348.6s)]
*  Cause it's kind of like Popovich with getting one Benyama where it's like, Reid's going [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=349.32s)]
*  to do this till he's in the grave. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=352.36s)]
*  Like he's not like until my home's goes. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=353.8s)]
*  Why would he leave? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=355.64s)]
*  No, I would. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=356.84000000000003s)]
*  Also Reid's smarter than everybody. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=357.4s)]
*  Everybody out like Reid is like, you know what I'll do here? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=359.28000000000003s)]
*  I'll just take the field goal. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=361.76s)]
*  I'll take the three points so we can go up seven. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=363.32s)]
*  I have Patrick Mahomes. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=365.24s)]
*  Like he doesn't overthink any of this shit. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=366.32s)]
*  And the Chiefs actually have a Patriots like infrastructure because I think what's [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=367.8s)]
*  I think there's a weird thing going on in the NFL right now where this assumption that [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=371.40000000000003s)]
*  youth brings new ideas. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=373.92s)]
*  And in reality, sometimes youth brings new ideas, but you can also bring the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=375.52000000000004s)]
*  cowardice to stand out. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=378.76000000000005s)]
*  And I think what a really interesting thing that the Chiefs have is that Andy Reid is [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=380.28000000000003s)]
*  the perfect coach, CEO, play caller, stability. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=384.68s)]
*  Mahomes is Mahomes and they work together. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=388.0s)]
*  The other thing they have going for them is that Steve Spagnolo is as innovative as [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=390.0s)]
*  any defensive coordinator in the NFL. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=393.6s)]
*  And if you were 39, everyone would say hire Steve Spagnolo to be your head coach. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=395.36s)]
*  But he's like 58. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=400.6s)]
*  So no one wants to hire Steve Spagnolo, even though because he was a bad head coach [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=401.92s)]
*  15 years ago. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=406.36s)]
*  Yeah, and he was good. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  That was in 2009. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=408.84s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=410.8s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, like there were the other guys being interviewed were in high school [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=411.4s)]
*  in 2009, like he's had an entire another career. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=415.4s)]
*  He's the only coordinator that's ever won four Super Bowls. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=417.68s)]
*  And it's crazy to think Steve Spagnolo is not going to get another job. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=419.96s)]
*  And so the Chiefs have this infrastructure of Brett Veach, the GM, Andy Reid, Mahomes [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=423.24s)]
*  and Spagnolo for, I don't know, seven, eight years and they're old, but they're still [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=427.32s)]
*  innovating. And so it's everything you need and they're not going to get disrupted. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=431.08s)]
*  That's what the Pats had. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=434.52s)]
*  Well, House just went through it. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=435.59999999999997s)]
*  He hired a new coach for the Washington Seawords. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=436.64s)]
*  Quinn came in. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=439.48s)]
*  He was at Ron Rivera. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=441.12s)]
*  That was that was first good thing. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=444.03999999999996s)]
*  He actually had a good quarterback, second good thing. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=446.28s)]
*  But you can see like he's definitely changed the energy. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=448.28s)]
*  That was what he did with the Dallas defense, too, when he was there. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=451.8s)]
*  That's what he did in Atlanta for a few years. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=454.6s)]
*  But he's like a big chemistry vibes, motivational drop and F-bombs guy. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=456.84s)]
*  Right, House? Like he's a thousand percent, a thousand F-bombs. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=461.44s)]
*  Oh, I couldn't love him anymore. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=466.16s)]
*  And, you know, the thing that matters is how relevant he is to these players. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=468.08s)]
*  Right. They he he stole some Dallas guys. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=473.88s)]
*  He brought Dorrance Armstrong over, who is if you look at, you know, his [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=476.36s)]
*  disruption rates for Armstrong, he's in the proper court. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=480.8s)]
*  He's where you want him to be. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=484.64s)]
*  But Dan Quinn, they they're playing for him. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=486.15999999999997s)]
*  Schefter did a report last week about Washington being a desirable place for free agents. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=488.91999999999996s)]
*  What Washington this place, the football team. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=494.03999999999996s)]
*  And yes, because of Dan Quinn, I thought that was a weird report. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=498.4s)]
*  Well, it's fine. I'm just saying the fact that I think NFL players are just sitting around going, man, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=503.52s)]
*  what are the most desirable place like it's like we would do a podcast, like two wide receivers [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=509.47999999999996s)]
*  in the wide receiver room going, what are your top five free agent destinations? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=514.04s)]
*  Oh, Washington looks like they have a good thing going. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=517.68s)]
*  I actually know where that stuff comes from. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=521.36s)]
*  I actually one thousand percent think that's what wide receivers do is just look around [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=523.0s)]
*  and look at the greener grass. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=526.76s)]
*  And they're like, and game players, they're just like, oh, it'd be so cool if I play. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=527.92s)]
*  It's like I'd be so cool if I played with Dame Lillard. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=530.9599999999999s)]
*  Then you play Dame Lillard. You're like, oh, this kind of sucks. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=533.0799999999999s)]
*  But but that's the thing. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=535.24s)]
*  I'm sure they watch Jade and Daniels on the red zone or on NFL.com. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=536.36s)]
*  And they're like, man, that guy's good. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=540.5999999999999s)]
*  I'd rather have him than gardener Minshew house. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=543.48s)]
*  Did you see what neighbors said last week? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=545.56s)]
*  No, what do you say? They just asked neighbors because obviously neighbors [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=547.4s)]
*  and Jane Daniels are really good friends at LSU. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=550.36s)]
*  And then they're like, hey, I didn't feel about, you know, that guy. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=552.12s)]
*  He's like, yeah, that guy. I mean, man, I mean, what a winner. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=554.08s)]
*  What a what a football. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=556.8s)]
*  He's going to go out there and compete and every single time, you know, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=557.88s)]
*  it's hard to beat that guy, you know, is what an amazing guy to play with. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=560.04s)]
*  And he just like looks up and I'm like, yeah, it's like, of course, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=563.56s)]
*  it's like, and I wish I'd played Jane and Daniels instead of Daniel Jones. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=566.56s)]
*  Well, part of it for sure. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=570.0400000000001s)]
*  Also, Washington will be in a ton of prime time games next year. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=571.16s)]
*  Like if you want to be a player that's on a stage, you're going to get a stage [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=574.0400000000001s)]
*  with this Washington knocking on wood. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=578.2s)]
*  I mean, you know, obviously, we never take anything for granted. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=579.6800000000001s)]
*  Would you rather be the Giants or the Cowboys next five years? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=582.88s)]
*  Wow. Definitely, definitely the Giants. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=586.28s)]
*  Because I, I think that they are going to continue to. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=589.28s)]
*  Jerry Jones is singular, singularly the most important player in the NFC East, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=593.16s)]
*  because he will continue. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=598.76s)]
*  It's exactly what Danny said. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=600.9200000000001s)]
*  He doesn't give a shit about winning football games. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=602.52s)]
*  What he cares about is his asses in seats. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=605.0s)]
*  And it just gets crazier and crazier. It's phenomenal. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=608.04s)]
*  I love that guy so much. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=611.08s)]
*  Jerry built the NFL. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=613.08s)]
*  And I think people forget the Cowboys are a side project for guys. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=614.2s)]
*  His main job is to make twenty billion dollars in revenue a year for the NFL. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=616.52s)]
*  And then also, I mean, one, he's older than Joe Biden, which seems relevant. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=619.32s)]
*  And then two, and then to bring this all together, Jerry's a fantasy football owner. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=623.36s)]
*  Where it's like good owners are like Bob Kraft hired Belichick out of the way. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=627.12s)]
*  The Hunt family, who just hired Andy Reid, got out of the way. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=630.2800000000001s)]
*  Jerry could do that. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=632.8000000000001s)]
*  But instead, he wants to tinker with the roster, right? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=633.8000000000001s)]
*  He wants to do all this stuff. So he wants to be on camera every week. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=636.5600000000001s)]
*  He's talking. What the fuck are you doing on camera? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=640.12s)]
*  I think my favorite is Mark Davis, who after the season, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=644.36s)]
*  I think we'll be paying three coaches that aren't coaching his team. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=647.88s)]
*  Which might be a record, right? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=652.08s)]
*  Gruden, McDaniels, and then Antonio Piers. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=653.24s)]
*  So David Tepper, David Tepper at the record, he was paying. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=656.6s)]
*  I mean, I mean, Matt, Matt Ruhl, he had Ruhl. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=660.12s)]
*  He had Frank Reich, this new guy. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=663.88s)]
*  And Ron Rivera. I think Matt Ruhl took a job at Nebraska. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=666.52s)]
*  So I think that offset it. But yeah, there was at one point. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=668.88s)]
*  I mean, the NFL sent a memo to the owners saying, please, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=670.9200000000001s)]
*  we're losing nine hundred million dollars a year to active coaches. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=673.72s)]
*  Like basically it was like David Tepper, please stop firing people. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=676.5600000000001s)]
*  But they had to send it to everyone. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=678.96s)]
*  But it was like, yeah, three going on, four coaches on his payroll at the same time. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5aSymww1I&t=679.9200000000001s)]
