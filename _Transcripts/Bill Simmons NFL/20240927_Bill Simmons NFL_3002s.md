# Riding the Steelers in Million-Dollar Picks (Week 4!) With Joe House  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmvbOSt-J6U)
*  Joe house is here. He has a quarterback.
*  Jaden Daniels is in his life as a superstar in waiting.
*  House is so excited.
*  You can't see on the, on the video.
*  He's in a hotel room.
*  He just rented a hotel room.
*  What is it?
*  Just massages every day.
*  What's going on?
*  You just rubbed.
*  I just wanted to be close to offensive greatness.
*  I have the offensive greatness of Jordan Daniel,
*  Jaden, Jaden Daniels in my life.
*  I know his name.
*  I am on the campus of James Madison university at the moment because I wanted
*  to be close to the former Holy cross coach.
*  What's his name?
*  Bob Chesney.
*  Bob Chesney.
*  He dropped 70 on North Carolina last week.
*  Yeah.
*  Why do you bet on that?
*  We've got nothing but offensive explosions surrounding us.
*  And you know, there were some offensive explosions in my living room, Monday
*  light, let there be no doubt.
*  Yeah.
*  What were the texts like?
*  You haven't had a lot of, oh my God, you must be so happy.
*  Football texts in the last 20 years.
*  They're all of the same kind, which is not believing it.
*  Right.
*  We had RG three, which was an incredible run in 2012 all the way up until, you
*  know, Daniel Snyder and his cheap ways put an end to RG three's career on that
*  field.
*  And then we did have a minute with Kirk Cousins.
*  Kirk Cousins did take the Washington team to the playoffs in 2015.
*  I went to that.
*  The game against who can forget, who can forget.
*  Unbelievable.
*  There was a minute there, but yes, this is a thing where like we got the right
*  guy for the right situation at the right time.
*  It happens so rarely in Washington.
*  So it's wonderful.
*  I actually had dinner with two Washington fans on a, on Tuesday night and they were
*  just so excited, you know, cause it wasn't just a performance.
*  There's been pieces about Daniel's where the teammates, the way they're talking,
*  you know, I love this stuff.
*  This is like my, my jam, uh, the teammates being like, he's him.
*  Like when we're following Jayden, this is the guy, like when the, when the guys
*  and the team just start raving like that to reporters, you know, something good's
*  happening.
*  I mean, I'm getting the same chills that I had Monday night because I did spend,
*  you know, hours with all of the breakdowns of that, you know, the whole internet.
*  Thank God it was the amazing conversions of events for that.
*  And I'll stop in a second.
*  It was a, a Monday night football game, the biggest stage and you know, the
*  Brown, the, the, the bills beat the crap out of the Jags.
*  So nobody was watching it.
*  Everybody flipped right over to Washington and that game was exciting because there
*  was scoring on every goddamn possession.
*  And so, you know, the breakdown of the tape afterwards is like, when you go slow
*  and watch the decisions he's making, when you go slow and watch the poise he's
*  showing in the face of, of, you know, oncoming rushes, that's the stuff that,
*  that, you know, put, put your, put your hairs up properly.
*  Well, one of the games we were looking at is for, cause we're going to do a
*  million dollar picks and we do, we did well last week and we'll get to that,
*  but cards washed in cards are favored by minus three and a half in, uh, Arizona.
*  And the Cardinals are a team that I've really liked.
*  Um, they're one and two, but both losses were like good losses.
*  Like they really hung with Buffalo.
*  They really hung with Detroit.
*  And this is the worst possible classic, stereotypical bad spot for Washington
*  coming off a late Monday night football game.
*  Everyone's super excited about how they did.
*  So the ride in the high, congratulations all week, short week, cross country.
*  And they have to play a team that has good offense.
*  And guess what?
*  Guess who doesn't have a good defense?
*  Washington.
*  The stats are just awful.
*  They're 32nd on third down their 30th on first down 31st against the past
*  20th against the sacks like,
*  Yeah.
*  If you have that kind of defense, you better score on every offensive
*  possession, you better not punt.
*  Cause if you give the other team the ball, they're probably going to score.
*  Right.
*  And the Bengals, all they did wrong was just not score a touchdown every
*  time they had the ball, which they almost did.
*  Like literally one miss field goal.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  It was a five point game, but really it was, you know, they had one miss field
*  goal on one of those possessions.
*  Yeah.
*  So no Echol in this game, but McBride is questionable, but you guys were running
*  the ball like Washington has the fifth best run offense right now, seventh
*  yards per play fifth on first down.
*  Like good stuff was happening.
*  The defense is bad, but you know, I'm looking at that one and I think we both
*  like the over and especially if we adjust it and are you allowed to bet against
*  Washington a million dollar picks?
*  Cause I'm going to offer you an Arizona money line over 43 and a half and that's
*  minus one on one on Fandl.
*  No, I think I'm a sober realist.
*  Like for me, we've kind of got the validation for the whole year from the
*  third game of the season.
*  Like all I hope for with this Washington team is to hit the over of six and a half.
*  When that's the only thing that I really invested in.
*  And so I'm like, fine.
*  I bet on Tampa in week one.
*  I don't think that there's anything wrong with trying to make money.
*  The money's still green.
*  What do you think about that over 43 and a half with the Arizona man?
*  Yeah, I do like that because one of my favorite bets from that game is Washington
*  over 23 and a half as it's team total.
*  So it's basically the same, same bet.
*  So I'm like, I'm going to bet to some degree because they probably score 24 to win that.
*  Yeah.
*  I like this Cardinals team.
*  I was really impressed.
*  I said it on Sunday.
*  I was really impressed by their two losses.
*  I thought they, they hung around.
*  I don't think their defense is very good and they'll probably give up points.
*  I wanted to do the minus three and a half, but the cheap touchdown potential of, of
*  the commanders, the C words, the commies.
*  What are people calling them?
*  The commies?
*  I don't know.
*  No, nobody calls them the commies.
*  I don't want to say it.
*  What do people call them?
*  Washington?
*  They call them the commanders.
*  He's not giving it up.
*  They call them the commanders.
*  What's his, uh, doesn't Kevin Durant call them the manders?
*  The manders?
*  I think he does.
*  I think that's what Katie calls them.
*  That's pretty good.
*  I don't mind that.
*  So, all right.
*  That's one I had.
*  I'm giving you a couple that I had flagged as maybes.
*  I'm not going to talk you out of that.
*  The only thing with that is, you know, uh, Arizona, you, you expect them to score quickly.
*  So that's the, why the over.
*  Um, is the, is the angle, but I don't want to mess with the 50 and a half.
*  I like, I like it down in that in the lower 43 and a half is nice.
*  44 points is 20, 24 to 20 and you're hitting it.
*  Next one that I was on the fence with, and I think you like this more than me, but the
*  Vikings at Green Bay Vikings plus three.
*  And I think the reason this is a stay away for me is I see both sides on it, but I'll
*  just the case for the vikes, which I think you and I both, that was kind of our.
*  Blink test of like, ah, the vikes, the way they played the last couple of weeks.
*  I mean, no three, you know, but the last two weeks were just awesome.
*  Awesome wins.
*  Last week was an absolute ass kicking in Houston.
*  There's an Aaron Jones, fuck you game.
*  Yes.
*  Possibly going back to Lambeau.
*  I'm circling.
*  He's a bad MFer.
*  There's the Jordan love coming back off of a knee injury that he's probably not a
*  hundred percent on and Brian Flores just blitzing the shit out of them.
*  And the Minnesota stats are nuts.
*  They're first in sacks, second in QB heads, first in QB hurries, first in tackle
*  losses.
*  They're also the most confusing defense when you're watching on TV, they're
*  showing this, they're showing that this guy's up, this guy's hopping back.
*  And there's a lot going on.
*  And my concern would be.
*  If I'm, if I'm backing Green Bay, this is a lot for love to first game back.
*  And then on the, and the other piece of that Green Bay beat Tennessee and
*  Indianapolis congratulations.
*  I mean, both of those were with, with Malik Willis and I will also, I want to
*  countenance this possibility.
*  It wouldn't shock me if, if Willis starts this game and plays the whole game.
*  If they're doing the rope a dope with, with love, right?
*  They want to make florists try and prepare and florists has the experience,
*  right?
*  They played Green Bay twice or it's a division game.
*  Um, but two different styles of, of quarterbacking entirely two different
*  types of threats.
*  And so just adding that onto the Minnesota plate, um, because I think it's
*  a dead even, uh, coaching matchup.
*  Yeah, it's good.
*  I mean, these are probably two of the best four teams in the NFC.
*  Green Bay's banged up.
*  I didn't like that part.
*  So here, here's the flip side, Sam Darnold on the road.
*  There's a lot of Sam Darnold excitement right now.
*  He started three and Oh in Carolina.
*  Um, this could be Sam Darnold's can everyone settle down on Sam Darnold game.
*  Love killed Minnesota last year.
*  He killed all this.
*  But shit, he's actually good at it against it if he's healthy.
*  And I think that's why this is ultimately a stay away from me because I remember
*  having Minnesota in that game last year with Josh Dobbs and love just murdered
*  them and I can't get that out of my head.
*  Sometimes, sometimes the right defense is just a nice matchup for QB.
*  So something about like, could we talk ourselves into a Vikings tease?
*  We can other other better tease options.
*  We'll get to that.
*  But Vikings plus three, I don't know that the line feels right.
*  Ultimately might be a stay away from me.
*  How about you?
*  Yeah, I'm, I'm on the side of the Vikings, but I understand all of your hesitation
*  and reservation and the, the real determining factor for me is the Green
*  Bay quarterback situation because they are either going to have a Jordan love
*  return, which is a tough situation, tough circumstance for all the reasons you
*  just with the, or it's going to be Willis up against Brian Flores who, you know,
*  give him the time to properly prepare for it.
*  So that's why I know I don't like, I'm just, I'm going to raise my hands and
*  congrats to Malik Willis, but that one I don't like because when you're watching
*  that weird Packers offense, they had the last two weeks, one of the things and it
*  did teams, they played just to them, the person that'll do this, but just move
*  everyone up and just attack the moment the ball snap because everything is going
*  to be kind of around the line of scrimmage and I just, I don't like their
*  chances against Minnesota because that's what Minnesota does and that's what they
*  are.
*  This, another thing with the Packers is I don't, I know this is a must win game
*  for the Vikings, but it's really not like they could lose this and it's fine.
*  You know, they have some injuries.
*  It's, it is Green Bay.
*  These division games.
*  It'd be three and one through four.
*  I know it's division game, but they'll be like, well, get it.
*  Like, I know they want to win, but this isn't like, ah, whereas if you're the
*  Packers and loves coming back, you kind of need this one, you know?
*  So anyway, okay.
*  They'd be two and two and they would have squandered their Minnesota home
*  game.
*  So not awesome.
*  Next one.
*  You have more Falcons saints thoughts than I do.
*  Falcons are now minus two and a half at home against the saints.
*  This feels like a sucker line to me where, oh, why?
*  So we're just off the saints now because they couldn't block Jaylen Carter.
*  We're out.
*  Well, it wasn't just simply not blocking Jaylen Carter.
*  It was a blueprint of how to slow that offense down, a blueprint of how to take
*  the runaway and they lost their center in that game.
*  I mean, Jaylen Carter, part of that Jaylen Carter success had to do with the
*  injury to the saints pro bowl center.
*  The O line is not the same.
*  Right.
*  Um, guess what?
*  Guess who also lost to offensive lineman last week?
*  Yeah.
*  Falcons.
*  True story.
*  I know they're both questionable at the, at the moment.
*  I don't know if they've been declared formally out.
*  I just didn't want to give props to Atlanta because they have impressed me.
*  I mean, we were properly skeptical at the beginning of the season
*  with them against Pittsburgh.
*  We cashed that.
*  That was a nice situation for us with Pittsburgh had them on the money line.
*  And then, um, what they showed against the Eagles and the chiefs, like who has
*  played that schedule in the first three weeks and they were right.
*  They was, they had two, one score losses, a one score loss to the
*  Steelers and a one score loss to the Steelers was a legit loss.
*  They did.
*  No, for sure.
*  For sure.
*  Chiefs, they should have won.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, it's past interference in the end zone ball on, on the one.
*  Then you don't have to mess around with all those shenanigans, silliness of
*  figuring out, you know, fourth down plays.
*  But, um, I just think Atlanta having seen that Philadelphia blueprint, we
*  haven't really seen the Atlanta, um, defense with the new personnel, um, in,
*  in full force.
*  So I just think it's a decent matchup for them.
*  I like Atlanta, uh, lay in the points.
*  How about this?
*  I hate myself if I bet either team and it's a stay away.
*  What is the, I'd hate myself either way game.
*  Cause you'd be like, ah, I'm going to take the saints and then car sucks again.
*  You're like, I hate myself.
*  Like how I found a Monday night with Trevor Lawrence, the self-loathing
*  bet of the week.
*  There are some self-loathing bets on this board.
*  I don't think this one is it, but we don't have to bet it.
*  I just, I'm just telling you my preference.
*  I like it.
*  I got to say there's and I'm with you.
*  I'm leaning.
*  I'm leaning to where you're leaning, but I feel like there's too
*  many injuries on both sides.
*  And this division makes me nervous.
*  Sure.
*  How about this?
*  Maybe you're just better off never betting on a division matchup in the NFC.
*  So maybe that should be added to the gambling bet.
*  If I step just stay away, we got to be careful.
*  You're, you're, you're 30 wins is in trouble.
*  Well, there's only going to be one way out of this one.
*  Yes.
*  Um, true story.
*  All right.
*  So I'm leaning toward a stay away for that one.
*  Fine.
*  Fine.
*  Fine.
*  Leaning.
*  I did say, so here's one I really need you to talk me out of before
*  something bad happens and maybe you won't be able to the bears who are
*  own three and are laying three points to the Rams and I'm, and I'm looking at
*  this going, ah, kind of like the bears.
*  They're 32nd yards per play.
*  They're 28th and QB hurries.
*  They're 29th and sacks.
*  Um, but on the flip side, the Rams are 32nd in yards per play.
*  They're 31st and QB hits, which is something that Chicago defenses, you
*  know, they've at least shown that they have no cup, no Nakua.
*  They're not top 14 basically in anything offensively, but passing yards.
*  And I just wonder like, there's, there's a world last week where they don't get
*  that fake pun against the Niners and the Niners just beat them by 20.
*  And we're like, Holy shit.
*  The Rams season's over and they stole it.
*  They snuck it out, but now they're going to Chicago.
*  They're outdoors.
*  The bears are all in three, but the bears, no, the bears are one and two.
*  They were throwing the ball.
*  Huh?
*  Oh, they are right.
*  The bears are one and two.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  They stole that game from Tennessee.
*  Their defense won a game.
*  Right.
*  But that almost felt like a loss.
*  I was counting.
*  We had it as a loss.
*  It was awful.
*  Yeah, you're right.
*  They're one and two.
*  But, um, so, so you're going to talk me out of this, please do.
*  Uh, the bears are sticky poo poo.
*  I mean, if you want to go ahead and get yourself in a, in a position where you
*  have to count on coach Eber Fluss, who will be returned to his rightful place as
*  a defensive coordinator or assistant soon enough, that is right around the corner.
*  Um, and, and, and Caleb Williams behind an offensive line, they improved
*  their skill positions there in Chicago.
*  But not the goddamn line.
*  And that poor man continues to be at risk and they can't do any of the
*  things with their new toys on offense.
*  They can't establish the run that kid is running for his life on the pass.
*  Now, here's the reason why.
*  But did you see the stats when he wasn't under duress?
*  He was actually really good.
*  Like there were like great stats.
*  If he just has three seconds, good stats.
*  Get them to three seconds.
*  Now this is the defense that, um, you know,
*  you might be able to do that.
*  This Ram's defense, the Rams, yeah, the, the, uh, the Rams, uh, defense 31st
*  and QB hits 32nd yards per play.
*  It's a, it's a disaster of a, of a secondary as well.
*  The, the Rams, um, you know, the, the bears do have the best unit in the game.
*  So if you want to make a bet on which one, which team has the best unit,
*  it's the bears defense and the bears defense has won a football game already.
*  They beat the Tennessee Titans.
*  So that could be the roadmap, the blueprint.
*  You're talking yourself into this now.
*  I just don't want to have anything to do with it because then you have to look
*  at it in the mirror and say to yourself, I laid points against Sean McVay and
*  Matt Stafford with, with Matt Eber, yeah.
*  Floos the douche.
*  I mean, you can't, who's going to do that?
*  Like you can't that that's, that's one.
*  Floos the douche.
*  What rhymes with floos?
*  Well, here's one we're going to argue about.
*  Oh, actually no, let's do this one.
*  Let's get this out of the way.
*  The Raiders are minus one and a half against the Browns.
*  I feel like there's not a lot of chances in our life left to fade the Sean Watson
*  with the bad offensive line.
*  The Cleveland offense is bottom three in yards per play, QB hits, pass yards,
*  sacks allowed third down conversion.
*  And I think unofficially most times a receiver has looked just bummed out and
*  like they wanted the season to end and they wished it was week 18.
*  But this Raiders team was dog shit last week.
*  I got carved up by Andy Dalton, got called out by their coach after the game.
*  I just don't know how that, like this feels like a perfect matchup for the Raiders
*  to their home.
*  It's only one and a half.
*  Like I saw I was leaning Raiders, but I, but this violates my don't bet on
*  two shitty teams rules.
*  So can we just say that move on?
*  I mean, like you're, you not, we're not betting on Gardner, Minshew, these nuts.
*  We're not doing that.
*  I mean, shoot, he's nuts.
*  No way.
*  Absolutely.
*  Raiders can't run the ball.
*  I'm not sure that the Antonio Pierce motivational tactic, um, you know, is
*  necessarily going to work with everybody in that locker room.
*  It feels like that locker room could be right on edge.
*  I that's a phenomenal game to stay away from.
*  I want to know in the, in 2024, where let's be honest, people are a little more
*  sensitive than maybe they were 30 years ago.
*  Just being blasted by your coach.
*  Is that like a good strategy when your coach hasn't done jack shit and this guy
*  is just fucking gets the machine gun out and it's just, I love that everybody.
*  We're in a moment now where you can get Devante Adams.
*  There's like a solo camera on him for the entirety of games.
*  We're, we get these phenomenal shots of that poor guy said to go to bench,
*  holding his head, poor, poor Devante.
*  And it's like, Oh, get him out of there.
*  You didn't realize the Gardner Minshew Aiden O'Connell combo might not have,
*  might not have been a good idea.
*  Just realizing that now.
*  All right.
*  We'll stay away.
*  Two bad teams.
*  Blah.
*  They do have a good defense and you know, if Max Crosby and Christian Wilkins go
*  crazy, they could beat the crap out of the press.
*  Max Crosby is not healthy and Miles Garrett isn't healthy.
*  I don't know who's healthy.
*  We're doing this on a Thursday.
*  Let's stay away.
*  Great point.
*  Great point.
*  All right.
*  Now it's time to really argue.
*  Cause I love the lions this week.
*  And I think you like the Seahawks a little bit.
*  And that line is now lions by three and a half at home against Seattle, who is
*  three and O and doing really well this season.
*  And it's a team that we've written a couple of times.
*  I wish we wrote them last week.
*  That line is now, yeah, three and a half.
*  So let me hear your case.
*  Well, a couple of things.
*  Walker still not a hundred percent.
*  Good point.
*  Two best guys in the D line, including Murphy.
*  They're awesome rookie.
*  Both of those guys are hurt and if they play, they're playing her, but they
*  both have leg injuries, so that sounds great.
*  Um, Seattle played Denver in New England and the Skyler Thompson Miami group.
*  And they barely beat New England.
*  And honestly, New England should have beaten them.
*  And Denver hung around in Bo Nix his first game when he was absolutely terrible.
*  He was been much better since the lions.
*  I still don't feel like I've played an awesome game yet.
*  We hit on them last week.
*  Really?
*  Well, just a lot of like, you see the pieces, but they haven't, right.
*  It's a meal with a bunch of awesome things on the table, but it doesn't
*  all make sense together.
*  Hook and ladder in the first half.
*  Right.
*  I think this is the week it's, it's, you know, a night game and it's the Seattle
*  team that's playing with house money a little bit at three and now, and you
*  could talk yourself into, oh, they'll be able to throw the ball and, um, and
*  Mike McDonald, don't give him a week to plan it.
*  I just think the lions are way better in this line.
*  I don't understand why it's not like six.
*  If the Seahawks aren't healthy on top of the fact that they can't block and
*  the lions defensive line has been awesome.
*  So I just, I really liked the lions, but I think you're leaning a little
*  Seahawksy, right?
*  Well, and it all boils down to ultimately Jared golf, who this season, uh, if you
*  look at, I have him right now in the, in the advanced stats, his, his PFF grade.
*  He's 29th thus far this season, his EPA numbers, uh, expected points, you know,
*  per play, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a,
*  his all plays on car national level.
*  So it'd be more of a group play than a five play from a quad attack from the
*  right, is aï¿½yd count for the heels of his team.
*  So that's the, that house running, the intended team to try to SPO too because
*  he's still overseas at this point in time.
*  Weck is just the, he's, he's just the middle of a pot.
*  Was going to give him to go to a pitcher home, play him better.
*  And they're here than continuing on now as â€‹â€‹ yeux first pitch.
*  You know was a defense in transition and and and we've seen you know that that teams can score
*  Against the Rams we watch what the Cardinals did the Rams now the Rams defense
*  Yes has injuries and all the rest of it
*  But 20 points in right in the regular time game against that Rams defense
*  16 points against the injured Tampa defense and then 20 points all of the points for Detroit were in the first half
*  They didn't score in the second half and that game swung on
*  the
*  inappropriately called back
*  Pick six that Jared golf through the refs took that away that game was close close
*  I mean kind of Murray threw a pick in the second half that that
*  kept
*  The Cardinals from from really making it dangerous, but counter. I'm just not gonna do that the Lions. That's all
*  countered Detroit's run 151 plays in the last two weeks and it's actually like law of averages
*  They should be scoring more points. They shouldn't be doing dumb shit
*  There's two bad golf passes. There's a fourth down play where they ran a stupid play
*  Like they've kind of been dominated in these games. I'm the counter to the count on the Lions. No rag now rag
*  No is out. You're right. No the center. Yeah
*  Let's make this our argue game we didn't have an argue game last year, but when we bet on the argue game
*  Well, I was gonna throw this at you
*  Detroit first half Detroit game
*  Parlay plus 100
*  Okay. All right. So that that I'm willing to do
*  I mean that that takes care of like the cheap touchdown from the Seahawks at the end
*  That we they could just take the lead early that they'll Seahawks will be down 10
*  They'll all of a sudden lock it for 68 yards or DK Metcalfe
*  And then it'll be Lions up by three sweating it out
*  But we'll have first half in the game and we're ready to go. They're at home
*  They should take a lead in the first half against fucking Seahawks
*  Your point is right. This is an enormous step up for Seattle's defense after they got to play against
*  Bo Nicks and Jacobi Brissette and Skyler Thompson, right? So there's real
*  Offense
*  Guess what? Those guys all suck. Well Bo Nicks has been pretty good because we had a great game against Tampa
*  Guess what? We're about to talk to him right now because he's getting too many points against the Jets
*  The Jets are seven and a half point favorites at home
*  Against the Broncos and I don't really understand
*  It because Denver's defense has been pretty good. I really feel like they put together a good game in a half
*  I said this said this last week on million dollar picks. We were talking about
*  How Denver really look good against Pittsburgh in the second half of that game?
*  And then last week, they just played great. They they beat up Tampa
*  We we probably should have taken the underdog money line on that because I think both of us like Denver you like Denver
*  You like the Giants both those hit
*  So seven half just seems high because you can run on the Jets
*  Then you move the ball on the Jets in general and even if this game's a double figures
*  I feel like they can get a cheap touchdown late. I also like they throw sir tan on Garrett Wilson. Yep
*  That's the case for sure and we get Sean Payton against Big Shot Bob Salah
*  The only reason this so the look-ahead was seven and a half
*  So then the numbers is kind of a big difference
*  The look-ahead was seven and a half
*  So then the numbers is consistent with what the look-ahead is and nothing's sort of changed over the course of season
*  The problem is the situation for Denver right second straight road game rookie quarterback
*  The Jets have their second consecutive home game. They have those they played three games in 11 days
*  They got that thursday night game. They kicked ass now. They got all the rest that they need in their home
*  Uh preparing for you know a rookie quarterback
*  Um, so we're gonna see this whether or not this Jets defense really can can they did
*  Perfectly fine against the one-dimensional
*  Um, no, you got you have to throw those injuries
*  Okay, that's fine thursday night the pats go down by 10
*  They can't beat anybody and sure it was just one of those games. So i'm not i'm no lessons learned from that
*  Okay. Okay. That's fine. I mean I agree with you seven and a half
*  Um is crazy and also like this is the season hello
*  Uh the right five and a half points or more the underdog now is 14 and two
*  The underdog has won 10 of those games outright 10 and six the uh, uh, the the dogs are in those circumstances. So
*  Anytime you see anything over five and a half. It's like better be careful because it's just the way the season's been
*  Um, it's a fun pick too. It's a fun one to root for you have the cheap touchdown at the end potentially but
*  I think bo nix says look. I I thought he was really good last week
*  In that tampa game like he and I know tampa's second there is a disaster and I get it
*  But it's gonna be fun
*  Like, you know the part of the thing that you're hearing out of new york is that hackett and rogers really want to stick it to
*  Peyton they really want to stick it to shawn. This is because they didn't get the chance last year when they played
*  Um, and so they're gonna try and run it up
*  But I like I you know shawn payton is kind of the smartest guy in the room
*  You would have put all those guys together
*  It's kind of fun
*  I don't I don't want to make a big investment in it because I could see a scenario under which the jet can also stay
*  Away. Yeah, because that would be my inclination
*  But I like where you're going. The thing I don't like about it from a denver side is
*  Like if i'm beat the jets i'm gonna pound the run
*  Right, and i'm just gonna try to keep the ball and keep the ball away from rogers
*  But the broncos haven't really run the ball that well. No and uh,
*  As as anyone knows who has javante williams on their uh on their fantasy team, but uh
*  All right, so maybe i'll i'll i won't put that in bold, but i'm going to include that on the list
*  so then eagles bucks
*  Where you know, sadly that the hurricane's hitting as we're taping this but the
*  We just learned over the years like those just become automatic stayaways those games
*  I actually like that matchup for the eagles
*  But we don't even know if they're gonna be playing that game and I hope everybody's safe there
*  But i'm just I think that's a cross-off for us, right? Yeah, let's stay away from it
*  There was injuries on on both sides too. Yeah, just create all kinds of uncertainty
*  Stay away. All right. So the big ones
*  so
*  Really the only ones we have so far cards money line with the over 43 and a half detroit first half game plus 100
*  I'm gonna take out the broncos
*  My favorite bet of the week and I hope you agree is the steelers in indianapolis minus one and a half
*  They've been incredibly good to us a million dollar picks week after week after week buckner's out for the colts
*  There's gonna be a lot of pittsburgh fans there
*  Indy's defense is just a flat-out atrocity. They're 31st against the run 28th on third down 32nd on first downs allowed
*  2610 yards per play
*  Their offense isn't
*  Much more awesome either
*  27th on first down 28th turnover 24th pass, but most important throw the stats out
*  Anthony richardson's all over the place and he's going it's the best defense in the league pittsburgh first and first and red zone efficiency
*  First and third downs allowed first and first down second against the run third and yards per play
*  This is seventh and qb hits. This is the best defense the league and their first and points
*  I mistakenly said 16 on sunday night. It's 26 points allowed this year
*  I just think the defense wins the game single-handedly. I was trying to figure out ways to get fucked on this
*  And it's really just richardson doing those two long 55 yard bombs where it's like they have eight first downs
*  But somehow two touchdowns
*  So i'm just acknowledging that but I think this is the game where they let fields cook a little bit
*  Let them throw in this crap colts defense. I have no idea how the colts won last week
*  I don't think they're good
*  And I think the steelers are really good. They kind of need this game
*  They need to go like seven and one in these first eight. I can't believe the line's only one and a half
*  I don't get it. So here are the cautions that i'll offer in the first place
*  The colts have an incredible offensive line thus far this season
*  They're first in the nfl in both pass and run blocking according to pff
*  Another thing the steelers defense. Yes. Awesome
*  But
*  kirk cousins in his first game
*  off of the achilles completely immobile bo nix in his second career start in the national football league
*  half of justin herbert
*  Full, I mean and hey they knocked his ass out. Give them credit for that. They sent him the sideline
*  He was already, you know immobile and yes, they they they completed the job the other sort of aspect of caution is just historically
*  Mike tomlin, um is much better in the dog spot as as opposed to a favorite
*  He's the only 45 percent as a road favorite in his career against the spread 33 40
*  and and two um
*  The reason that I think i'm inclined to join you on the steelers is because I don't think that we've really seen
*  justin fields yet like
*  I've long been in the camp of of fields. I had fields on my fantasy team last year
*  And I will tell you in our keeper league. I gave serious thought to keeping him for one dollar or whatever it is plus the escalator
*  Hoping that he's gonna play upcoming season even though russell wilson had been declared the starter because the fields upside
*  We haven't really scratched the surface. They really haven't done any design runs for him
*  And this could be the week the pathway for the colt. Yep to to beat pittsburgh
*  Is to try and give pittsburgh a dose of its own medicine kind of like what we expected last week out of the charges
*  Which is just try and run the ball try and squeeze the life out of the game
*  Try and play a game that's only two hours and 45 minutes because we're just running running running
*  jonathan taylor left jonathan taylor right but
*  Fields to me is the wild card and at one and a half points
*  I mean here's the thing that I also am willing to count on stikens good. I mean he's he's stikens good
*  But he also has some of the dumbest
*  Big plays of the game calls of anyone
*  Well, they trust richardson. That's the problem. They have to say trust anthony richardson
*  This is a bad defense for him to play in his fourth
*  Start of the season and i'm with his sixth start ever right i just in his whole career
*  I really believe in the steward's team. I think they're good. The question for me is you know
*  If they could this be the game where fields just sucks like he sucked a bunch of times against the bears
*  Sure, but against this colts defense. Why would this be the game that he falls apart?
*  they can't play anything I love
*  This version of the steelers where it's apparent that they are treating every one of these early
*  Season games early games on the schedule is absolute must wins
*  They have to get all these wins before they get to the portion of the schedule
*  Where they have all those division games
*  Um and and other you know, super talented teams at the back half of their schedule. So here's the other thing the pedal is down
*  Browns the browns are gonna suck
*  the bangles are all in three the ravens are playing the bills and could be
*  You know one in one three after after sunday and the steward's could be four
*  No, they could have a three game lead in the afc north. Yeah, so I don't know
*  I like they've been really good to us and i'm still in on them me too. Okay two more
*  Ravens bills
*  Okay, see unfortunately, I heard east coast bias today and I know where you're leaning on this
*  But I think we're seeing it the same way
*  look
*  Ravens minus two and a half against the bills. Hmm. Why isn't that line lower?
*  Why is that line a pick them the josh allen's like the
*  Just looks like he's the best player in the league the bills look great
*  They're gonna be able to throw on the ravens
*  They're getting a pass rush this year, which none of us expected they figured out some sort of secondary thing
*  There's some ewing theory with stephan diggs even though they've never won a title with him
*  um
*  The tease is just so tantalizing here
*  This feels like a one scored game to me and i'm not positive who's gonna win
*  In there's that if it's bills plus up all the way to plus eight and a half
*  Ravens can be in double digits. Well, we know what happens when they go up double digits to put the game on a platter for the other team
*  The bills might be able to win and it allows us to tease with the next game
*  We're going to talk about but bills plus eight and a half
*  Does that make your nipples hard? I absolutely love it. It's not jayden daniel zipper zone quite
*  But it is it's it's it's way up there. I absolutely adore the bills as a teaser leg
*  This week, I think um, you know that the back door is extremely open
*  With this ravens team is a wide open backdoor situation. I'll just leave it at that
*  I really I could take this much much deeper, but I won't do it. You haven't had nearly enough drinks
*  I have not baltimore's defense 28th and first downs
*  32nd and pass
*  Like all the last it's all in the last 10 minutes of the fourth quarter
*  Because it's all when the when the other team realizes like why the fuck aren't we just passing every down?
*  they can't stop anything and
*  Something about josh this year and it
*  Shout out to the cuz that was his super bowl pick. I thought it was
*  I really battled on them back and forth and I ended up giving that afe spot to the
*  To the uh the jets because I really wanted to work the jaguars into the playoffs and I gave the jaguars the buffalo
*  Playoff spot
*  And I think I did pretty well with the future so far, but that was I think by far my biggest mistake
*  There was a case for the bills. There was a case against the bills and the case against them was
*  They have all this dead cap weight
*  You know milano got hurt now bernard got hurt during the season
*  um
*  But none of it seems to matter because alan's been that good and maybe he's just going to be this good the whole year
*  Right. Well, this is the game where it might matter, right?
*  We might I think we finally are going to see
*  In baltimore a team that's going to try and take advantage of the injuries the linebacking corps
*  Tarantaron johnson's compromise so they'll just run the ball down their throats. They're going to yes
*  They're going to scheme that way for sure. I've been really impressed by buffalo's, uh,
*  Pass rush and just their front in general every game. It's jumped out. They're von miller. He's alive
*  Because two of you you the instinct is to throw away week two because two got hurt
*  But by the time two got hurt that game was over like they dominated them for two hours. So yeah, you know
*  It's probably the second best team. They're kind of the team that I thought houston was going to be to be honest
*  All right, so we'll put them in a teaser leg love it and
*  The ravens hooked us up last week. No disrespect to them, right? Thank you
*  Yeah, no, yeah, and they can win and then there'll be two and two in in the afc north
*  Well the other teaser leg. So what's that going to be? Well, I have an idea
*  How about the fucking chiefs minus seven in la against the chargers and the chargers?
*  We've written a couple times. Yes, I have a bunch of future bets on them
*  But this is just this is a throwaway game. They herbert's probably not playing I think would be crazy to play him
*  They're missing their two best tackles joe alt and slater. Yeah, both those guys are out
*  James got suspended for their secondary and then bosa like go figure he got hurt again
*  So they're missing not only five starters, but five of their best eight players five of their best seven players
*  Right and they're in a bye next week
*  And they've kind of overachieved anyway, right? They're two and one
*  And they'll look at this and go. Ah, you know what? Let's let's just let's get to the bye
*  We will probably not be in the chiefs anyway two and two
*  Um, this is just a nightmare matchup
*  But I don't see a scenario where they hang this taylor heinecke you root it for taylor heinecke
*  He's gonna be running around la and making plays and doing stuff like get the fuck out of here
*  Yeah, no chance. He's he's uh, you know six yards behind the line of scrimmage and a cloud of dust
*  That's the taylor heinecke experience
*  um, it's the only thing that i'll i'll sort of urge
*  As a caution is the lines moved a point in the direction, uh, you know away from the chiefs
*  The chiefs remind us eight at one point. I'm trying to figure out what what has happened to pull this down to seven
*  I have your answer
*  I think people have been looking at the chiefs defense and thinking it's a little house of cards ish
*  That there's a lot of when they play straight up defense
*  They're actually like a bottom eight defense when they're blitzing and doing stuff and basically using tricks to get pressure. They're better
*  So it's a lot of like trick stuff with them
*  I just don't think they're gonna need a lot of tricks with the chargers the chargers were having trouble moving the ball
*  um
*  last week, you know with
*  With when all the when the tackles were playing yeah, um
*  Do you take out their run game and now you're you're making heinecke throw to like these?
*  Subpart receivers. I guess maybe some of the two is the chiefs run defense hasn't been awesome
*  But I mean, I I would think that that if you were gonna
*  Be skeptical of the chiefs. It would be more on the offensive side of the ball total
*  Because then the other piece is the chiefs are three and oh and they're three plays away from being on three, right?
*  So maybe story people look at that and I was like man that line's pretty high harba. Let's grab all those points
*  but
*  Chiefs historically haven't covered those big numbers. But look we are in
*  Exotica we are going to do a tease. We don't need all the points
*  Just grab it seven down to one that's that's living life the right way and push buffalo up to eight and a half
*  Against baltimore in a one score game baltimore doesn't blow anybody out. They're definitely not blowing out the bills
*  I'm gonna knock on wood right now. I don't want to talk it into existence, but that's how we do it bs
*  Well, here's the thing we missed on the tease last week
*  All right, we we didn't do one last we didn't do it
*  We lost the first two weeks and we have not hit a tease yet
*  And now because of these records of the five and a half and up favorites like all the teases have been destroyed this season
*  They have been I it's gonna be an overcorrection. We're now everyone's afraid to do the tease
*  It's like come on. It's gonna be the chiefs against easton staker taylor heinecke
*  They just have to win by one point and the bills to be in a one score game against the ravens
*  and plus
*  That's it. It's your birthday
*  We're not gonna lose it. It's my birthday. It's your birthday week
*  Did dave chang make you some chowder for your birthday?
*  No, he didn't he better save that for when I come out we can celebrate it together
*  I want some chang chowder. You know what happened to me? I I might have to have my dad on to talk about this
*  And this already happened to you
*  I am a now out of the 18 to 54 tv demo
*  You know when they talk about the coveted advertisers demo of 18 to 54 right i'm out so what
*  Did you stop watching the chicago mbc shows? What happened to you?
*  When you hit 55 ncis
*  Uh indianapolis, you were like, oh chicago fire and then a brand new chicago pd
*  Is that gonna happen to me? There's law and order still on us. So, you know, i'll be like, oh homicides on peacock
*  Lock up
*  Bang on season seven of homicide. What's gonna happen to me?
*  Am I still gonna like white lotus? Am I too old for white lotus now? Is ll cool j still doing that that
*  Investigative show that's the one
*  Like there's that fox surfing show. Am I is that am I not in the demo for that now with that that new surfing show?
*  They have I think that's awesome. Those waves are incredible. I can watch that for hours. I'm mesmerized by big waves
*  Does that make us the wrong demo?
*  These people are so stupid like just we all have nice tvs now like to have a show with the ocean in hd
*  Where like the big waves yeah giant waves and lifeguards like what took so long. What are these people doing?
*  It used to be called baywatch
*  So one more thing fandel was having yeah, it used to be called baywatch, which was an important show of our
*  Important important some would say vital
*  So
*  fandel has for a featured bet this week and anytime td score a bet
*  That if you hit you get a 50% profit boost
*  So we're just going to add that to our bets plow into that
*  Harrison td plus 100 is that what we want to do?
*  I kind of love it
*  I mean all you need to do is look at how has the opposing team's best receiver done against the washington secondary
*  Week by week and it looks pretty effing good jamar chase with 115 yards and two touchdowns
*  Malik neighbors had an incredible game both godwin and evans had
*  Great games against i mean you just have to you know at some point you have to accept the free money
*  All right, it's the time it's million dollar picks time
*  So we're going with four bets this week and then then the little harrison thing
*  Okay, we built up a nice nest egg with the with the winnings from last week
*  Do you want to scale back at all and do like less than 200k a bet or you want to keep it at the 200k bet?
*  This does not to me feel like a big 200k bet kind of week. I mean, I think we're still learning 150
*  Yeah, there's a lot of injuries out there, too
*  All right, we'll scale back a little bit the million dollar picks for week four last week
*  We won three hundred and eighty thousand dollars and it would have been way more
*  Except the jaguars decided to pull our pants down
*  I hate the jaguars never again notice. We didn't talk about them when we did our million dollar pick
*  I was like, oh the jaguars seven against houston. No, fuck you. Jaguars. We're done. We're done with you
*  Go to your room. Don't come out. You're grounded. We hate you
*  Uh, we're up for the season five hundred and four thousand dollars through three weeks. That's pretty good fake money. Yeah, not bad
*  Uh the million dollar picks for week four the stealers
*  Who have been in credit? They've been our mvps of million dollar picks. I have undoubtedly even you're in now
*  They're laying minus one and a half in indianapolis
*  To anthony richardson who is the trick-or-treat quarterback maybe of our generation
*  Right now it's more trick-the-treat
*  It's it's a lot of tricks and occasionally some treats and we are going into this fully well-knowing
*  There might be one play maybe two where he just goes back and he throws it 60 yards and it's in perfect stride
*  We're betting on all the other plays
*  The plays you don't see on the red zone this passes that sail over people's heads the leading the league in interceptions
*  Yeah, we're betting on the turnovers and on an awesome awesome awesome steward's d
*  And house you're a little bullish on a field's
*  Like I do think i'm giving a little more to fields each week. Maybe so yeah, i'm stacking it up
*  All right, so we're gonna put we're lowering a little this week
*  Just because it's a week four perennially
*  uh 150 000
*  on the steelers
*  Minus one and a half. That's our first one
*  Next one is a little parlay action. The cardinal is playing your washington team
*  And the over which is over it's like 49 and a half or 50
*  But we're going to bring that over down to 43 and a half in the cards money line and we're going to parlay that
*  And it's minus 101 on fandol fine and we're jumping on that just the cards need to win by
*  One point and we need 44 points or more total and these two offenses with no defense on either side. Let's go
*  That's right. I'm not I mean, I don't even feel disloyal
*  Going against washington you set it up perfectly, you know coming off the the you're not winning the superbowl this year
*  You just want an awesome jaden daniels year and don't get hurt
*  This is a don't get hurt jaden daniels keep giving us joy
*  The superbowl was winning in cincidadi in the week three on monday night football in front of a national offense
*  Audience we've done it. We've done it right with troy acheman super impressed with the
*  The throw in the corner as he just gets annihilated to mcclaurin. Yeah, okay
*  So we're putting 150k on that and then because fando has this little special the 50 profit boost
*  For and any for any sort of touchdown
*  Score we're gonna go marvin harrison
*  Anytime touchdown
*  Which is plus 100
*  And we're just gonna throw 25k on that for great shits and giggles. Yeah, get the profit boost
*  Yeah, we like you marvin. All right next one
*  detroit
*  At home on a monday night against the seattle team that can't block anyone that has defensive line issues that might not have kenneth walker
*  And detroit has not really played a good start to finish game. I think it's gonna be this week detroit first half
*  Detroit game parlay. I talked you into this you did money plus 100 on fandol fine fine
*  150k on that just take a lead in the first half detroit and take care of business and you can fart around and gov can throw his
*  one stupid pick and ben johnson can have his one terrible fourth down play that
*  jim here gives his running sideways doing a flip lateral pass and gets you can do all that but just win the game
*  and take a lead in the first half, so that's
*  Our third bet and then the last but not least we're we're going back. We're doing a tease
*  We're not listening to raheem and everybody else who hates teases, but no raheem likes teases as long as we do it properly
*  It's a special week
*  Because we have this gift of the chiefs minus seven in la with five of the best seven chargers out
*  Including both of their tackles
*  Their safety who runs their secondary their best sack guy and their quarterback who's the star of their team?
*  None of them are playing we just need the chiefs to win by one. We're taking that down from minus seven minus one
*  By the way, there's probably gonna be 45 000 chiefs fans at that game. Just just gonna mention that
*  We like the chargers not the week. They have a bye week next week. Just right whatever
*  We don't care. We'll be two and two heading the bye week. Everyone will get healthy. We'll be fine
*  Chiefs minus one bills up to plus eight and a half in baltimore
*  one score game
*  One score you have to say who's gonna win that game?
*  I might be uh
*  Making the case on
*  The ringer pregame show sunday morning for the buffalo money line
*  I kind of like the bill on the money line against that's what's great about that line is I actually think it should probably be
*  A pick them or maybe even bills minus one or somewhere in there
*  Um, but I think it's a one score game. So we're taking bills plus eight and a half
*  And that is our tease
*  So four bets this week plus a little harrison. We're not it doesn't add up to million dollar picks
*  It doesn't always have to sometimes we have to be smart scaling it back a tiny bit 150 000 on the four bets plus the little harrison bet
*  And those are the million dollar picks
*  For week four and joe house has a quarterback
*  That we're kind of betting on in this game because we have that we have the over in that game
*  So you can still root for him to do stuff and not feel bad about it. Believe me. I will
*  House great to see you. Thanks bs. Happy birthday, buddy. Thanks, buddy
*  You
