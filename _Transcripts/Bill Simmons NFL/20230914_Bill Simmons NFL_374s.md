# Is It Time to Hit the Panic Button for Josh Allen and the Bills? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Gkg9OhX7go)
*  So if you look at the AFC East, Miami before the year was plus 290 to win the division.
*  And now they're plus 140.
*  They're now the favorites.
*  Buffalo, who we're about to talk to, plus 120, they've, they've fallen to plus 145.
*  The Jets dropped to plus 700 and probably should be dropping even worse than that.
*  And then the Pats were eight to one and they're now nine to one on FanDuel.
*  And my reaction coming out of that Monday night game, and this is, I felt bad for Rogers.
*  I felt bad for the Jets fans.
*  But as a Pats fan, at some point you start looking at it going, we played them in week
*  three and that was supposed to be this really hard game and this gauntlet of the first six
*  weeks.
*  And now, you know, we could be getting Zach Wilson in Foxborough unless the Jets do a
*  miracle thing.
*  I think that Pats eight to one is kind of crazy.
*  Miami should clearly be the favorite, but I don't know if I trust who either.
*  Now the odds aren't as tasty as they were.
*  And it almost seems like the Pats are the only like long shot.
*  I'd rather the Pats the long shot odds over any of those other odds.
*  So talk me in.
*  Can you talk me into Buffalo?
*  Is that just a bad game?
*  What did you like?
*  No, I'm not.
*  I'm not pressing the panic button on Buffalo, but it was such a weird game that you can't
*  you can't move on the bills right now, even with them below the Dolphins.
*  We talked about this a lot in Extra Point Taken with Sheel.
*  We're like there are games where Josh Allen makes a bunch of knuckleheaded mistakes because
*  he's just trying to be a superhero all the time.
*  And it's like, OK, dude, like you're very talented.
*  Yes, it's very cool.
*  You can throw the ball super far.
*  You got to relax.
*  And then there's games where Aaron Rogers goes down on the fourth play of the game.
*  And you just as an individual and as a captain of the team have to decide, hey,
*  we're going to play mistake free football and win a game on the road
*  against a divisional opponent like you're not a trick shot artist.
*  This is not you're not not building out a highlight reel.
*  Ever since that twenty twenty one Chiefs Bills incredible playoff game,
*  like thirty six to forty two, the Allen Mahomes game.
*  Allen's been playing every game like he's got to do that.
*  And I get that it was sick to play in that game and it was an incredible game.
*  One of the best games, whatever unbelievable quarterback performance.
*  But Allen has to mature.
*  Allen has to decide that he's going to make decisions for the sake of the team winning,
*  not for the sake of him hitting fifty yard touchdowns.
*  All three of the interceptions that he threw were knucklehead stuff.
*  Just just plain and simple.
*  No, you can't sugarcoat it.
*  It was just stupid, dumb decisions.
*  And to do that in a tight game, Aaron Rogers and the Chiefs and Mahomes like, OK,
*  like I can at least like wrap my hand around it and justify it a little bit.
*  You got to create something to do it in this game where the moment Rogers gets on that cart,
*  you say, OK, we're going to run the football, we're going to control the ball,
*  we're going to generate a lead, we're going to make them throw their way back into this
*  and we're just going to win this thing.
*  I thought I was very disappointing.
*  But that's like a unique context.
*  That's like, you know, in the vacuum of week one.
*  I would not be surprised if in week two, Alan walks out and looks like the absolute
*  wood chipper that he's looked like during stretches of the last two years.
*  So I'm going to go wait in C mode with the Bills.
*  I didn't pick them to make the playoffs.
*  And the case for them to make the playoffs was they have Josh Allen.
*  So they're going to go 10 and 7, 11 and 6.
*  When you and Shield did your over unders and division picks and all that stuff,
*  it was the same case. Shield was like,
*  I he laid out all the things I'm a little worried about, but they have Josh Allen.
*  And that's what we always said.
*  But if Josh Allen isn't playing at the highest level,
*  I just don't see a lot of talent with them.
*  I don't think they're bad, but I don't think they have a lot of impact players.
*  And you could feel it last night.
*  Like once Rogers went out, it's like, all right, the Jets are going to run the ball.
*  They're going to be terrified to do anything with Zach Wilson.
*  They were still able to run the ball.
*  Yeah, I was I was surprised by that more than anything.
*  The fact that Sean McDermott takes that defense over from Leslie Frazier
*  says we're going to be more aggressive.
*  And then Aaron Rogers goes down, Zach Wilson comes in.
*  The only thing the Jets can do now is run the football.
*  And they're still give up an 80 yard run to Breeze Hall like two drives later.
*  Immediate. That was that was a sirens for me.
*  Yeah, one of the well, but even that even the last drive, right,
*  they get the turnover and you know what they're doing.
*  They're like the Jets have decided with four minutes left that game.
*  Zach Wilson's not throwing another pass.
*  We're good. We're just going to run the ball.
*  But they ended up getting a first down. Right.
*  And then the one time they should have thrown it, I think there was two or four left.
*  And so they knew they had the two minute coming.
*  So the clock was going to stop anyway.
*  And it was like the perfect play action time.
*  The Bills had like nine guys on the line.
*  And you have Garrett Wilson by himself over on the left.
*  And it's like, man, if there's ever a time if Zach Wilson is competent,
*  even one percent, this is the time to throw a pass.
*  But they wouldn't even do that.
*  And the Bills still lost.
*  Yeah, it's from twenty nineteen to twenty twenty two.
*  The Bills is four over four drafts.
*  The Bills have drafted exactly one pro bowler.
*  That was Dawson Knox.
*  He had one pro bowl season in twenty twenty two.
*  And then they drafted his replacement, Dalton Kincaid, at tight end
*  in the first round of twenty twenty three.
*  All along those drafts are defensive players. Right.
*  You have a first round on Gregory Russo, defensive end.
*  He was like, good, but you still need to take the step and kind of be
*  the impact player. Second round pick on AJF Vanessa.
*  Second round pick on Boogie Basham. Right.
*  You have they got Tremaine Emins into the building and then they spend
*  third round pick on Terrell Bernard, who's now starting at Mike Linebacker,
*  trying to make him the future guy there at Mike.
*  They spent the first round pick on Tyree Elam.
*  It's a healthy scratch. Right.
*  They spent a fourth round pick on Jaquan Johnson to be a backup safety.
*  He can't hack it.
*  Now you've got two over 30 year olds and Jordan Poirier and Micah Hyde back there.
*  They have been trying to land on young talent to retool the offensive line
*  and then the defense.
*  And they have just missed and missed and missed.
*  They've got like some solid players in them.
*  Like the Gabe Davis pick was a nice pick.
*  Devin Singletary was a good back for a third rounder.
*  He's solid, whatever.
*  But they have not hit on impact players.
*  And that's the issue with the Bills.
*  The cupboard is run bare.
*  And now you're really trying to hold this thing together, like you said,
*  on the merit of Josh Allen's talent on games where he behaves like that.
*  No chance.
