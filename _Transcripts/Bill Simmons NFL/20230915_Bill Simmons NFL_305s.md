# Are the Cowboys Ready to Be the Favorites This Year? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWaUu-c7iJI)
*  Uh, your Cowboys, you know, Jerry, who we've all made fun of and everyone has pointed out
*  his lack of success really since the Barry Switzer Superbowl season.
*  And I was the one I think who was comparing them to the Kardashians where it's this famous
*  family that everybody talks about, but nobody knows what the actual talent is.
*  But yet they've landed all this talent and Parsons is, if he's not the best defensive
*  player is one of the best defensive players.
*  This defense looked absolutely terrifying last week.
*  There's enough offense to go around and it's just hard to, hard to pick knits with this
*  team unless you could do the whole, well, we got to see Dak look at his playoff record
*  or the McCarthy piece of it.
*  But for the most part, it feels like there's, you know, I said this Sunday night, it feels
*  like there's three really, really, really superb teams.
*  I'm including Philly and maybe they won't even get there.
*  And then it's a major drop off.
*  But I don't remember Dallas being in this spot before this early.
*  I'll tell you what feels different for a Jerry built team is that Jerry loved famous football
*  players who were often not the best football players.
*  And Joey Galli, the Joey Galloway, Alvin Harper, Zeke Elliott, Jaylen Smith.
*  I mean, you know, we could go on, there would be these guys that have these enormous profiles,
*  but were not actually great at their jobs anymore.
*  This team beyond Micah Parsons and Dak, who you mentioned, is built with Tony Pollard
*  and Terrence Steele, their right tackle and Tyler Smith, the guy that drafted in the first
*  round last year.
*  It's they have really good safeties.
*  It's just like a well built football team.
*  I thought they played free agency really well by getting Stephon Gilmore and Brandon Cooks
*  for mid round picks.
*  Yeah, Ken are just good football players.
*  So it just feels very, very different than other cowboy teams.
*  And that's what makes me think that they could be really good this year.
*  It's one of those.
*  It's just more fun when they're involved.
*  Of course.
*  You know, the NBA has a few teams like that too.
*  Like you can talk about, oh, it's so nice to have Milwaukee in there and stuff.
*  But when it's like the Celtics and the Lakers and the Sixers, now we're bringing in 50 plus
*  years of stuff in a bunch of cases.
*  The thing with the Cowboys, like they were talking about this Giants Cowboys rivalry.
*  You know, they played that up on the week one.
*  Who is the Cowboys rival?
*  Because you could say it's the Giants, but you know, other than the LT or like what were
*  the great Cowboys Giants games?
*  It was like they were never really good at the same times.
*  And then I would say the Eagles, same thing.
*  Like mate, you'd go back to the nineties, but for the most part, I don't really feel
*  like they overlap.
*  Who do you consider the big Dallas rival?
*  I'd say the Eagles felt, at least during the regular season last year, like the one that
*  was the nastiest.
*  That felt like this is a huge game.
*  I don't want to lose.
*  I won't feel good about losing this under any circumstances.
*  And then I think the other one is the 49ers just because they beat them in the playoffs
*  the last two years.
*  And that feels like it's heated up a little bit again and was really the true rival of
*  the 80s and then later in the 90s.
*  But I agree with you.
*  I think it's the Niners.
*  Because they've had the most memorable games against the Niners.
*  And the other one we got denied this week is Aaron Rodgers versus the Cowboys.
*  That was an absolute murder of the Cowboys year after year after year.
*  You remember that one pass in the playoffs, the Cowboys were the number one seed.
*  Not going to happen.
*  That was supposed to be this week.
*  You know, prime game on CBS.
*  But we'll see.
*  I want to talk about Rodgers night in one second.
*  So hold that one.
*  If you had to guess how this Dallas season plays out from a media coverage fan base,
*  hysteria, dominant storyline standpoint, it feels like they have a chance to swallow up
*  this season if they can keep it going like they did.
*  Yeah.
*  Especially because the Jets content feels like it's about to tail off.
*  That's gone.
*  Yeah.
*  We're done with the Jets.
*  Mahomes isn't going to be that as fun as usual to watch because he doesn't have the same
*  weapons.
*  Miami is kind of interesting.
*  If they can keep two on the field just because of how much fun they are.
*  But it feels like it's a Dallas San Francisco collision coming.
*  I accidentally turned on Greenie yesterday, Bill, when I was driving around the car.
*  Was he hosting his own show or no?
*  He was actually on.
*  That was the first surprise.
*  Amazing.
*  And he's reading these emails.
*  You had a one in nine chance of hearing him host his own show.
*  I can't believe it.
*  He's reading these emails and it's like, could the Jets win a Super Bowl based on their defense
*  like the 85 Bears?
*  I'm like, guys, the drawbridge has gone up on Jets content.
*  We're done.
*  We spent the whole preseason on that.
*  It's time to move on.
*  We're all good.
*  Thanks very much.
