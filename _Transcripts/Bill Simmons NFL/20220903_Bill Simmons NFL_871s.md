# Can the Raiders Win the AFC West? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXV-nF_u2Vo)
*  AFC West, the most fun division to talk about.
*  Really great.
*  You watch any night game, right?
*  Could be any of these four teams playing each other.
*  Are the Chiefs and Chargers the two best teams in the league?
*  In the league?
*  Yeah.
*  I like the Raiders.
*  I have the Raiders win the division with 11 wins.
*  Wow.
*  Really?
*  I don't know what's going on in people's heads.
*  Like, people...
*  What is going on in your head?
*  Well, if you ask most football fans who won that game the last week, Raiders or Chargers,
*  I think most people would say the Chargers.
*  They didn't win that game.
*  The Raiders won the game.
*  And if Carr doesn't spike the ball and they lose it down there and they were, you know,
*  five yards, six yards away from going to overtime against the team that made it to the Superbowl.
*  And now they add Jones and they're doing great.
*  You know, they extend Carr.
*  You know, they add Chandler Jones, who's a pressure guy.
*  They add Devante Adams.
*  I like this team a lot.
*  Forget about, you know, the Gruden stuff.
*  They had their president quit on them.
*  They had obviously the rugs thing was terrible.
*  I think they're back on track.
*  I have them fourth in the division.
*  Do you really?
*  Their over-under is eight and a half.
*  They're seven and one to win the division.
*  Seven and one.
*  I've seen that since February.
*  And that's what I was like, I have to take that.
*  Six or less wins plus 270.
*  Best record in the league, 60 to one.
*  Ten plus wins plus 150.
*  Worst record in the league, is that it?
*  Worst or best?
*  No, best record.
*  Ten plus wins plus 150.
*  Their odds are all over the place.
*  I like this team.
*  Here's what I don't like.
*  Loaded with the playmakers.
*  I have them at nine league players, including the kicker and the punter, who I think are
*  both really good.
*  But no offensive line.
*  Their offensive line is a bottom five, terrible offensive line.
*  Okay, but it wasn't great last year.
*  And that's the part that worries me.
*  And then you have the Waller thing where...
*  I like to see him play.
*  You pencil him in as, oh, it's Waller.
*  He's one of the best head ends in the league.
*  He was kind of up and down last year.
*  He wants a contract.
*  He just switched agents.
*  I think Renfro does better than Devonte Adams, but I think they put it together.
*  I do love Renfro.
*  You and I both are huge Renfro guys.
*  What are we going to bid on him?
*  So here's the thing.
*  So you bring in McDaniels.
*  I see the whole case.
*  Everyone knows you hate McDaniels.
*  You have to hate McDaniels.
*  I don't know how good he is.
*  I forgot about this.
*  I don't know how good he is.
*  All the Belichick people have to fail after.
*  I get it now.
*  That's okay.
*  That's not how we feel.
*  We're not spiteful like that.
*  Josh helped us win some Super Bowls.
*  I just don't understand how people can just discount how bad their offensive line is.
*  That should matter.
*  It was bad last year.
*  And also, they blew three Gruden drafts there where multiple first round picks were just
*  not on the team anymore for a variety of reasons.
*  I think Jacobs is probably the best one.
*  Max Crosby was a later draft.
*  That's why you can't get on their draft too much because it's Leatherwood getting cut
*  and all those other guys.
*  But at least I think that's the reason to like the Raiders.
*  They didn't have draft picks this year to screw up.
*  They had no first and second round picks.
*  So they're free of that and free of a lot of just garbage.
*  I worry about receivers switching teams.
*  Just point to me all the time that it's actually worked out in an awesome way.
*  Not some reason it's always weird.
*  Not too many.
*  I think Adams and Tyree Kill's numbers go down, but I think their teams...
*  It's funny.
*  I think they're eight, nine or worse.
*  Well, here's the thing about the AFC West.
*  And then you can point to their schedule.
*  It's tough, first five.
*  Everybody's got a chunk of five games that are just brutal.
*  Just like take the month off.
*  Forget it.
*  Who can get through them is the question.
*  But yeah, if you say the Raiders are in last, I'm not going to scream.
*  You're nuts.
*  I think Denver's in last.
*  People like them.
*  People putting them in the Super Bowl.
*  I don't feel that way.
*  But I do think one of those two teams is probably the seventh playoff team in the AFC.
*  I think we get three out of this AFC team.
*  So Cincinnati or Baltimore.
*  I have Cincinnati in.
*  So you don't have Baltimore in.
*  No, I think Cincinnati wins in vision and Baltimore makes it two.
*  So I have two in that.
*  One in AFC South.
*  What?
*  So then you can't.
*  One in AFC East.
*  And then I got three in the AFC West.
*  Oh, one.
*  Not one wild card.
*  Yeah.
*  So then Denver comes down to Denver versus Vegas.
*  And I just feel a little better about Denver, even though I'm with you.
*  So you're not a charger guy then?
*  No, I'm in on the chargers.
*  I got three AFC teams.
*  Let's go.
*  KC 10 and a half.
*  I see what the hell is going on here.
*  This is one of my locks.
*  To the division plus 155.
*  Ten plus wins is minus 210.
*  So no value there.
*  Best records nine and one.
*  I kind of like that.
*  AFC number one seed is plus 650.
*  Last year they were 12 and five.
*  They beefed up their defense.
*  Carl Aftis and Duffy.
*  Two rookies that are coming and helping right away.
*  Apparently there's been a Frank Clark comeback, which I'm excited about.
*  Chris Jones is in the middle now.
*  I think their defense is going to be better than people think.
*  And I've said this on the last three pods, so I'll just say it quickly again.
*  Mahomes in a great offensive line I'm in.
*  Mahomes with time.
*  I don't care who his receivers are.
*  He's going to have five seconds to throw.
*  These guys are going to be running around and then he'll buy another two seconds and
*  just over and over again.
*  We haven't seen him with time in four years.
*  Doesn't this team have three seasons every year?
*  It's like the first four, like they have no defense.
*  Oh, they can't.
*  They're not going to last in January with this defense.
*  Then the defense figures it out.
*  Then Mahomes will go like five games where he has like seven total touchdowns.
*  Like, whoa, what's this?
*  Why can't they score?
*  If you look at some of their wins, they don't have to put up 40 to win the game.
*  Granted, they played the Packers without Aaron Rodgers and they have a few wins like that
*  last year in the 12 and five.
*  And I know they have a tough start.
*  Arizona, at Arizona charges Colts.
*  I don't think Arizona is a tough game.
*  If you look at the first seven, it's tough.
*  I think he's like 22 and four in September.
*  Mahomes since he started.
*  No one bothers me.
*  They're going to be a favorite at Arizona.
*  They're going to be a favorite at all these games.
*  So we're both in on KC.
*  I love Kansas City.
*  Because I made this case the other day about how I feel like this could be his 2022 Warriors
*  Curry season.
*  Where everything's built around him now.
*  Don't be sarcastic.
*  Everything's built around him.
*  It's like, hey, you know what we should do?
*  We should be able to block for Pat Mahomes.
*  Right.
*  And you know what?
*  Maybe we'll spend the money there and the capital there and then we'll just get good
*  to decent receivers.
*  They'll get the juju comeback year.
*  Running backs are okay.
*  But really, this is Mahomes' team now.
*  He's just going to go nuts.
*  It's kind of like Barry Sanders, right?
*  Like, if they had, imagine if they had an offensive line.
*  It's like, no, he improvises so much, he might screw them up.
*  Yeah, just get open five seconds later.
*  I think he's going to have the most fun he's had in his career this season.
*  Yeah.
*  I also think the old chip on the shoulder from he blows the Cincy game in the weirdest
*  hour and a half of his career.
*  Right.
*  And then it's this whole now it's Josh Allen's league and now it's Herbert MVP.
*  Huge Herbert jerk circle.
*  By the way, I'm in it.
*  Don't make room for me in the Herbert jerk circle.
*  But it's just it's everybody else and not Mahomes.
*  He's not overrated, but he's over.
*  He's over praised.
*  I think Herbert.
*  Yeah.
*  I just like, don't forget how awesome Pat Mahomes is just because he sucked in that
*  Bengals game.
*  Also, if you gave Pat Mahomes an extra down the throw, like that stale is nuts.
*  They're going for it on fourth down every time.
*  So I feel like Herbert has more chances to succeed because they go for it on fourth
*  down, like not as much.
*  The older coaches don't do that as much.
*  I think the Chargers have the best roster in the league and I love how they beefed
*  up at all the positions that actually matter.
*  Their over under is 10.
*  The over under actually moved.
*  It was nine and a half.
*  They actually bumped it to 10.
*  It's still minus 140.
*  You get in for the division for plus two 40, get it for best record for 16 and one.
*  You get them.
*  AFC number one seat plus nine 50.
*  And look, I think both of these teams could go like 12 and five, 13 and four.
*  Really?
*  Wow.
*  I'm more nervous about staley than anything with the chiefs.
*  Yeah.
*  I thought staley was appalling last year, not just the game management, but their
*  defense was bad and I know they brought in Khalil Mack and they brought in JC
*  Jackson and I get it.
*  Tell me why he's at the top for coach of the year.
*  Was he?
*  He is right now.
*  Brandon staley.
*  Yeah.
*  I feel like he's the weak link on that team.
*  That's what I'm thinking.
*  And, and if meanwhile you can get the bills coach for like 15 to one or something.
*  It's really bizarre.
*  Like, wouldn't you rather have Sean McDermott than staley?
*  Yeah.
*  Staley drives me a little bit nuts.
*  Chargers most fun team in the league.
*  For sure.
*  Yeah.
*  Like I'm like, there's going to be no week where it's like, ah, the
*  chargers are on one of the TVs.
*  It was like, cool.
*  Put the chargers on.
*  Yeah.
*  But there's also, you gotta think there's, first of all, there's two things.
*  There's also always like a kicking thing that screws them up or something really
*  stupid, something, you know, the, the, the team doctor, whatever it might be.
*  Second thing is the team doctor stabbing the quarterback.
*  Yeah.
*  You can't give them a decisive home win in any way.
*  That's it.
*  I'm so glad you brought this up.
*  They have no home field advantage at all.
*  It matters.
*  Yes.
*  The chiefs have a home field advantage.
*  Yeah.
*  Now, granted it didn't work out in that Bengals game, but for the most part, it's
*  nice to have your fans cheer for you at home.
*  Yeah.
*  Sal and I live in LA.
*  Nobody cares about the Chargers.
*  At Kansas City.
*  Sorry.
*  Home versus Vegas.
*  There's going to be a lot of Raiders fans, a lot of Raiders.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Maybe Jacksonville.
*  They don't have a Denver week.
*  Six Denver for sure.
*  There will be, um, Seattle, Kansas city.
*  You'll have a city for sure.
*  Uh, Miami will have, I mean, there's a lot of Miami fans out here.
*  The Ram and the Rams is just, you know, the Rams is basically a home game
*  for the Rams have 10 games at SoFi this year.
*  Yeah.
*  If Justin Herbert was the Dallas Cowboys quarterback, would he be
*  the biggest star in the league?
*  Interesting.
*  I think he would.
*  You think he's been Mike Trouted a little bit out here and a little bit.
*  Who the fuck cares about the Chargers?
*  She might as well be playing in like Mexico City.
*  I go two ways with him because I think he gets a lot of praise.
*  A ton of praise.
*  A lot of people leaning on him as, as MVP at 10 to one.
*  He's very fun when you've bet on the Chargers and they're down 17 in the
*  third quarter, and it just seems like he can bring them back in like five, in
*  five, in five throws.
*  So there's like, I'm a homes quality to him.
*  I don't trust the coaching infrastructure.
*  I do not trust the baggage that they've had with all of these dumb losses they've
*  had over the years and the lack of home field.
*  So I, my edge is to the chiefs.
*  I like the chiefs doing that division.
*  One thing I'll say that people love the JC Jackson, by the way, I think he made
*  top 15 or top 20, just off of basically off last year in the NFL 100, they love
*  the Cleo Mack trade, but they were 31st in the league against the run and they
*  have some run stoppers and Joseph Day and Austin Johnson, they picked up from
*  the Rams and Giants.
*  So that, I think they'll be better there.
*  And Bosa and like, if you say blue chip, red chip, you can go on and on.
*  Boses are in there, but it doesn't ever add up with them.
*  And I, I'm telling you that home field matters that they're miserable after a
*  while.
*  I had, they were the highest team in my rankings with, with, uh, with chippers
*  34 and a half.
*  And they had Herbert, Eckhart Williams, Allen, Lindsey Slater.
*  No, just add it up with the stupid scoring system.
*  I have Mack, Bosa, Jackson, Samuel is probably the best, uh, Nickelback in
*  the league and James, um, linebackers not awesome.
*  Like they picked up Kyle Vannoy and people were talking about like, and
*  they've got Kyle Vannoy.
*  It's like Kyle Vannoy was terrible last year with the Patriots.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know if you watched the Buffalo game when they did whatever the
*  fuck they wanted against us.
*  So, all right, Denver quick.
*  Denver's over under is nine and a half.
*  I don't know why I don't like them as much.
*  AFC number one seed plus seven 50, 10 plus wins minus one 34 playoffs minus one
*  40 six.
*  Yeah, I just don't think I've said this already.
*  I'm I'll make it quick.
*  I don't think Wilson is the 2014 15 Wilson.
*  I don't either.
*  And I don't think that's a controversial thing to say.
*  I don't think he moves around the same way when he's more in the pocket,
*  like all that stuff.
*  The fact that they lost, um, Tim Patrick already, they have two receivers.
*  Judy, we've never seen really play.
*  He's taunted us.
*  You can't say he didn't have receivers the last few years.
*  Right?
*  He had Metcalf and Lager.
*  Yeah.
*  And Metcalf was better with Gino Smith.
*  I know it's a small sample size, but everyone that you think you're getting
*  exactly the two, the six year ago version of Russell Wilson, I don't think it's a
*  case at all.
*  There is this thing with quarterbacks though, when your team hasn't had a
*  quarterback for a while and then you get somebody a really good or super
*  competent guy, it is fun.
*  It does like completely transform the club.
*  Sure.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like when, uh, like when CBS got Letterman and they had just, nobody
*  could even remember who was on there.
*  And then it's like, we have Letterman and there's this stability and credibility
*  that just lifts everything.
*  And Wilson's at least going to do that.
*  Where you go from Drew Locke and Teddy Bridgewater and all the dudes they had
*  and broken down Peyton Manning and he'll have some throws in the first month.
*  I'm like, Oh my God, we have Russell Wilson.
*  This is our guy.
*  So that's why I'm going slightly over.
*  I think so.
*  I don't know.
*  I think, um, cause they have Randy Gregory and he kind of screwed over the
*  Cowboys and I have a little, little bit of a, you know, I don't know how
*  that's going to work out.
*  They have some bangers on D.
*  Yeah.
*  I have five, five, like, like legit guys on that defense.
*  Jones, Gregory Johnson, Sir Tan and Simmons.
*  Sir Tan by the end of next, by the end of the season, he might be other than
*  Jaylen Ramsey, the best corner for all.
*  There's good numbers on his, uh, to be a top interception guy.
*  Yeah, I like him.
*  All the people like Lindsey Jones who works for the ringer now and she's
*  going to, she's gone to like every Broncos preseason and she was like, that
*  guy's champ Bailey.
*  Right.
*  Like that's, champ Bailey was an iconic generational quarterback.
*  And she, she's like, they've recreated him now with Sir Tan.
*  Now is Javante Williams the most hyped?
*  I don't want to say overhyped, but hype player.
*  You know, I love him.
*  Why though?
*  What's, what's, what's indicating that he's not going to split carries
*  again with Norman Gordon.
*  He's going to be super disappointing in fantasy.
*  I had him last year.
*  All I was doing was rooting for them to put him in.
*  I had him on both teams and then Melvin Gordon had three big games.
*  And then the stats, he was like, here comes Melvin Gordon for three yards.
*  So could you put the other guy in?
