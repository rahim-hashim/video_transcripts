# Million-Dollar Picks Week 17 With Joe House  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [December 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s)
*  Alright million dollar picks. We're already up house. We won three hundred thousand dollars on Christmas Day [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=0.0s)]
*  Thanks to the Ravens Merry Christmas and thanks to the Chiefs [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=4.48s)]
*  And we still have a Seahawks bed [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  We're taping this before the Seahawks game, but we have a Seahawks bed with Baltimore minus nine and a half adjusted [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  In the Seattle Moneyline those plus 312 so we could be up another like hundred and fifty five K after tonight [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=17.32s)]
*  I [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=24.72s)]
*  Like some of the games this week. I know you already did ringer and gambling show [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=25.84s)]
*  I didn't hear it yet because it's not up [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=29.08s)]
*  but the big game and the hardest one to figure out in a while and [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=30.52s)]
*  I think the most even great matchup we've had all season is this Vikings Packers game in Minnesota and the Vikings [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=34.839999999999996s)]
*  It's it's around one one and a half right now. It's Vikings one and a half [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=41.96s)]
*  You could make really strong cases for each team. I [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=45.72s)]
*  Think there's a lot of public [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  Kind of love and affection for the Packers right now, which would make me a little nervous for them [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=52.92s)]
*  Green Bay lost to them earlier in the year [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=58.9s)]
*  and Green Bay is 10 and 2 in the last 12 weeks with two trade losses and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=62.94s)]
*  People are leaning Green Bay in this house and we have to treat it like a playoff game [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=67.82s)]
*  Means more to Minnesota because if they can win this [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=71.9s)]
*  They beat Detroit next week. They're the one seed right Green Bay is pretty locked into [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=75.38s)]
*  The five or six seed not sure it matters. Where are you leaning on this one? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=81.5s)]
*  I'm I'm inclined to look at that Green Bay side [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=87.02000000000001s)]
*  mainly because of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=92.14s)]
*  Just how? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=94.74000000000001s)]
*  Effective they've looked on both sides of the ball their defense. Yeah, it's just been so [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=96.54s)]
*  Impressive they're able to put pressure on opposing quarterbacks. They're still generating turnovers. There was skepticism earlier in the year [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=101.74000000000001s)]
*  I'll put my hand up [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=108.5s)]
*  About you know, they're their defense was producing what felt like an outsized number of turnovers [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=110.42s)]
*  And that was the way that they were [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=115.42s)]
*  Able to look so good defensively [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=118.06s)]
*  But they they've continued to do so and now it looks like their offense is healthy [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=120.66s)]
*  And now Jacobs is really they're really [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  Pounding, you know leaning into that run game and it looks like last year [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=130.26s)]
*  Where Green Bay went on this run at the end of the season when Aaron Jones was finally healthy and they were he [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=134.02s)]
*  Led the NFL over the last five weeks and into the playoffs Aaron Jones for Green Bay in rushing and I kind of feel like they're [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=140.22s)]
*  They're gearing up in the same direction with with Jacobs [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=147.1s)]
*  It's not intended to be disrespectful in any way shape or form towards Minnesota [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=149.94s)]
*  I mean is it is the line I think is super fair and I think you know [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=154.86s)]
*  The money line is minus 108 for both teams like that's yeah [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=159.3s)]
*  In the book and I think that's that's totally appropriate [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=164.22s)]
*  Green Bay outgained Minnesota the first time they played by by I watched that game though that game was over [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=167.5s)]
*  They were up like four touchdowns [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=172.9s)]
*  And then there was a lot of garbage time stuff with Green Bay and it it kind of belatedly somewhat became a game [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=174.86s)]
*  But not really. Yeah, okay, but it was a lot of end-of-the-game shit [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=180.68s)]
*  These teams tend to split against each other just historically. This is an important division game [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=184.42000000000002s)]
*  So mine my lean would be Green Bay, but if the Vikings go win like who's gonna be shocked [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=190.1s)]
*  So I guess where I've landed in this game is if it was in Green Bay [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=196.06s)]
*  I would like Green Bay and because it's in Minnesota. I like I like Minnesota more [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=200.5s)]
*  I just think these teams are dead even yeah, and you throw in the home field. There's one other piece with Minnesota though [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=204.98000000000002s)]
*  First of all I do think they're better than people realize and I and we've talked about this a bunch on this podcast, but [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=211.98000000000002s)]
*  It's it they became a yeah, but team and we've had yeah [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=221.38s)]
*  But teams before that I thought was justified like there was that cousins Vikings team a couple years ago that we were like [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=225.94s)]
*  What this team's not good what this records ridiculous looking at they played the Vikings are eight no with Hawkinson [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=232.1s)]
*  Yes, which I think matters. Yeah, the Vikings are sixth and DVO a Green Bay's third [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=238.38s)]
*  The Vikings are second against the run [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=244.14s)]
*  They're first and creating turnovers [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=247.3s)]
*  They have a top five pass rush, but the thing I really like the most about them is [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=250.42s)]
*  These two receivers they have with Hawkinson. I always feel like they can get a drive if they need it [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=255.26s)]
*  Yeah, and if this games in the fourth quarter in their home [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=260.38s)]
*  I just like their chances to go down the field like one stat that I think is I saw this and I was like [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=262.82s)]
*  How is this the best total but it is? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=269.3s)]
*  They lead the league in least amount of percentage. They've trailed when they're on offense in the game [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=271.7s)]
*  They've only trailed for 22% of their snaps on offense [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=276.86s)]
*  They've been trailing in the game, which basically means they're always ahead. They're always in charge [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=280.18s)]
*  They're always in the lead, which is good for home [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=284.94s)]
*  But then they also have the ability at the end of games to get a drive if they need it and to make a big play [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=288.02000000000004s)]
*  If they need it Green Bay's gonna do cover to like they their defense actually matches up pretty good with the Vikings [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=292.22s)]
*  But I like this [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=299.02000000000004s)]
*  Vikings team and to me it's like if you believe in this Vikings team you kind of have to take them this week [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=301.02000000000004s)]
*  So if you don't you're basically saying I don't believe in this thing. I [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=305.54s)]
*  Don't know do we go that far? Yeah, I think this is a playoff game. I [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=309.34000000000003s)]
*  Do I think I think this is playoff rules this week. I think we have to approach it like playoff manifesto [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=313.74s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know what's Green Bay [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=318.70000000000005s)]
*  You know doing if it really is a playoff game, right? Like I'm saying from Minnesota [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=323.66s)]
*  It's a playoff game. They win this game. They have a chance to be the one seed [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=328.54s)]
*  They play Detroit. There's also a conspiracy bill would like to enter this for one second. Go ahead [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=332.54s)]
*  There's no Sunday night week 18 NBC game right now. It's either Minnesota Detroit or [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=337.66s)]
*  Rams [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=345.14000000000004s)]
*  Seattle [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=347.14000000000004s)]
*  Which we might not get if the Rams just beat Arizona this week [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=348.54s)]
*  Which we're gonna have coming up a million dollar picks [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=352.5s)]
*  The only other possibility is Minnesota to trade by Minnesota has to win this game [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=354.94s)]
*  And if that doesn't happen now we're into [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=358.54s)]
*  Care who'd you have Carolina? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=362.86s)]
*  Carolina, yeah, Atlanta if Atlanta [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=364.86s)]
*  Carolina [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=368.86s)]
*  Atlanta Sunday night [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=370.06s)]
*  Yeah, but that would be good because then you'd have Bryce Young against Michael Penex [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=372.06s)]
*  How is that good to have Carolina Atlanta as the last game of the season? That's not good at all [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=375.74s)]
*  Four wins, it would be hilarious. This is what it would be [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=380.70000000000005s)]
*  I just wonder it's just funky because it's [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=383.90000000000003s)]
*  I just wonder it's just funky but go ahead. I just wonder do they [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=386.54s)]
*  Did this Minnesota get some calls in this game? Well, they will be at home [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=391.5s)]
*  They'll get home calls you expect for sure. I I don't you know, this one is just a stay away because [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=394.62s)]
*  It's it's it's ready. You don't get it. I don't get any value on it. It's a way [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=401.66s)]
*  This is we have a big little nest egg of million dollar picks and this is the best game in a while [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=405.58000000000004s)]
*  We have to put a bet on it. Go ahead. Give you let me give you something that I thought was interesting [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=410.62s)]
*  Green Bay since week five [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=416.38000000000005s)]
*  Their nine and two with two detroit losses, right? Yeah, here's who they beat [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=419.42s)]
*  Matthew Stafford in week five with no puka no cup. Yes [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=427.26000000000005s)]
*  kyler murray [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=432.46000000000004s)]
*  CJ Stroud no collins in that game [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=434.38000000000005s)]
*  Trevor Lawrence barely beat him. He had his best game of the year threw for 300 plus yards against them. They won by three [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=438.46000000000004s)]
*  I think they were up [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=444.14000000000004s)]
*  They were up [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=446.14000000000004s)]
*  Chicago's up the whole game and should have won and then green bay won it late [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=448.14000000000004s)]
*  Brandon Allen on san francisco [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=454.3s)]
*  Tua on cold weather on thursday night thanksgiving [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=457.74s)]
*  Geno smith and whatever the fuck was going on with the new orleans quarterbacks last week. Those are all their wins [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=461.90000000000003s)]
*  They haven't made anything remotely approaching sam darnold hockinson [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=469.42s)]
*  Addison and jefferson and erin jones. This is by far the best complete offense they've played now do minnesota [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=474.54s)]
*  Well, I know minnesota is the same thing but i'm saying you can't use that case against minnesota and then not use it against green bay [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=481.66s)]
*  Well, I think they're in in very similar positions because this is a gigantic step up in class for minnesota [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=488.14000000000004s)]
*  Minnesota's defense hasn't seen anything like this green bay offense. Look at these these offenses [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=495.90000000000003s)]
*  That that minnesota has seen since they lost to the rams, uh in you know week six or seven whatever it was [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=502.38s)]
*  Yeah, they played the colts with anthony richardson. They played the jaguars. They played the titans. They played the bears [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=509.09999999999997s)]
*  They played kyler and the cardinals which was a huge comeback game, right? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=515.42s)]
*  The cardinals were up that should have been a cardinals win not a great vikings game [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=519.26s)]
*  They got kurt cousins and the falcons. Yeah, uh in his triumphant return to minnesota [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=522.9399999999999s)]
*  Which ended his career in atlanta and maybe his career in nfl football [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=528.3s)]
*  And the the bears and the seahawks the the best game the best win was going into seattle [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=532.8599999999999s)]
*  And going coming down to the wire and that's the irony of this both team both teams most impressive win [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=538.62s)]
*  The last like two and a half months was seattle [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=545.02s)]
*  Who also might not be good? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=547.9799999999999s)]
*  Well, they're kind of like they're good enough to be fighting for a playoff spot. But yes, yes [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=550.14s)]
*  If we're going to do that, we have to do it for both both teams [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=555.9s)]
*  And the interesting thing to me you made the case for minnesota's offense [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=558.9399999999999s)]
*  Looking good. You want them with the ball at the end of the game? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=563.9799999999999s)]
*  I think it's I would say the exact same thing about green bay [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=567.18s)]
*  It's to me. It's not that dissimilar from the handicapping of that 30 thursday night detroit green bay game [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=570.54s)]
*  Right came down to which team had the ball at the end great game, right? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=576.9399999999999s)]
*  I don't think there's a wrong answer. I'm just okay like people have tilted more toward the packers and I feel like it's dead even [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=580.54s)]
*  And I think well, Minnesota's favored [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=587.18s)]
*  Well, they're even though they get the minus one half because they're home [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=590.06s)]
*  But what i'm just saying is in green bay green bay would be minus one and a half over minnesota true [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=593.66s)]
*  But but like the public hasn't jumped in yet with with with a big uh perspective [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=598.06s)]
*  So you're thinking it's a stay away [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=604.62s)]
*  I mean [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=606.62s)]
*  If you want to put something small in it so that you can say we did it and it's fun and then [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=607.74s)]
*  Minnesota wins it's like excellent now we have minnesota and detroit and week 18 for the one seed that would be awesome [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=611.98s)]
*  So we're taping this at 11 17 [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=618.46s)]
*  Pacific time yeah, december 26 thursday true [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=621.82s)]
*  The line is completely flipped it's now green bay minus one and a half over minnesota [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=627.34s)]
*  So somebody stepped in that's somebody stepped in [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=631.74s)]
*  That's a syndicate play so the line moves three points [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=634.46s)]
*  And now it's minnesota minus 102 [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=638.22s)]
*  plus one plus 1.5 [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=641.66s)]
*  In green bay minus 116 [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=645.34s)]
*  Somebody's taking a stand [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=648.06s)]
*  Does that make you nervous or or what? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=649.8199999999999s)]
*  I honestly think that we're going to see one or two more of these over the course the next two two days [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=652.54s)]
*  I bet I you know the rivals so you think green bay is going to get to minus two and a half [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=657.8199999999999s)]
*  No, I think somebody will come back in on any other direction and I got you know, it'll it's going to flip again [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=662.54s)]
*  Vikings being plus one and a half means they're now in t's territory. Yeah, that is you you would want to do it right away [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=668.54s)]
*  Right away. Well, we can do right away. We're taping million dollar picks as we speak good point [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=674.86s)]
*  um [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=680.78s)]
*  Any interest in throwing them in with the miami dolphins in cleveland? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=682.14s)]
*  Mm-hmm. There's gonna be rain. He's miami down to [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=686.38s)]
*  Miami down or we could basically do [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=690.94s)]
*  Yeah, tease my what is miami six and a half. Yeah. Yeah [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=694.62s)]
*  Tease a half [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=699.66s)]
*  Tease miami down to money line and do miami plus seven and a half [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=701.26s)]
*  The only thing that would concern me about the miami situation. Well, there's a lot of things that concern me [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=706.46s)]
*  I don't know you're gonna go with only [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=712.0600000000001s)]
*  Um [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=714.8599999999999s)]
*  The the single most prominent is if dtr anything happens to him at quarterback [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=715.66s)]
*  What I want to see is where james is listed in in terms of did you read I was on brown's reddit today? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=720.6999999999999s)]
*  Which is one of the darkest places in the internet. It's just absolutely brutal. There's even on brown's reddit [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=725.8199999999999s)]
*  there's even um [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=732.3s)]
*  Uh, should we make a run at kurt cousins this offseason? No. Yeah, that's a friend on brown's reddit [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=734.14s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it's dark man. It's it's some of the darkest shit you'll see [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=740.46s)]
*  But uh [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=746.46s)]
*  Brown's reddit was saying that apparently james is hurt too. And if anything happens with dtr [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=747.66s)]
*  It's bailey zappy time. Oh, well now i'm feeling better. Okay, now we can do miami fine now [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=753.74s)]
*  Now we're good. It's bailey zappy injured james or it's dtr who has one touchdown in nine career picks [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=759.82s)]
*  Well, I thought they already said that dtr is going to start my concern was that dtr would start something would happen to him [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=766.14s)]
*  And then james would come in and the tears playing not 100 healthy though [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=771.98s)]
*  Well, I mean I just need to make I want certainty that james will not come in because if james comes in then I feel like [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=776.78s)]
*  For some reason you're worried about james [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=783.26s)]
*  I to me it's i'm not worried about cleveland's offense in this game [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=785.26s)]
*  I'm worried about the dolphins in the rain just doing a I understand classic dolphins stink bomb [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=788.46s)]
*  We don't have to put them in a teaser. I mean there's another good good legs dallas is a pretty good teaser leg [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=794.22s)]
*  well, the reason I I brought them up for [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=800.22s)]
*  uh a teaser is just [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=803.02s)]
*  You know [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=806.22s)]
*  At some point these teams the the franchises are kind of steering them toward a top five pick, right? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=807.5s)]
*  I don't think the giants want to win the raiders are stupid. They couldn't help themselves last week [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=813.5s)]
*  But there's certain teams that I just feel like are good with not winning another game. Yeah [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=818.3000000000001s)]
*  Cleveland to me feels like one of them like if you're cleveland bailey zappy is the move this week [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=823.98s)]
*  We had bailey zappy on the paths. He is not a confident quarterback [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=828.7s)]
*  You want to put him out against miami next week? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=832.78s)]
*  You want to bench like or you want to rest like a defensive starter is a little banged up like you [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=835.4200000000001s)]
*  There's subtle stuff you can do [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=840.7s)]
*  To make sure you don't win again [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=842.78s)]
*  because for sure [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=844.78s)]
*  Because there's a couple like tennessee plays jacksonville both those teams are three and 12 one of them are going to be four and 13 [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=846.86s)]
*  After four and 12 after that game so cleveland can jump up a spot there [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=852.62s)]
*  The pats might beat the chargers for all we know like they they might be able to nudge up [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=856.62s)]
*  Yeah, that was what I was thinking about and plus miami really needs the game. They're still in the playoff race [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=861.42s)]
*  Yeah, still in the race for sure [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=865.42s)]
*  So maybe because I have another tease I want to do with the two la teams. Okay, so maybe [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=868.06s)]
*  We'll mark down uh something with [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=874.06s)]
*  Vikings dolphins just for fun. Uh, next one [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=876.54s)]
*  You said on the ringer gambling show that you like cincy at home minus three in what's going to be bad weather [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=879.7399999999999s)]
*  They're kind of technically alive still [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=888.3s)]
*  denver [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=890.8599999999999s)]
*  Needs a game. This is weirdly a playoff game in some ways, right? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=892.2199999999999s)]
*  Right. No, I I think both teams will treat it like a playoff game [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=896.38s)]
*  And this is exactly why my handicap is in favor of the cincinnati bangles. That's why I prefer [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=900.2199999999999s)]
*  The bangles I like the team with the players that have actually like played in the playoffs [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=905.42s)]
*  Yeah, the team that doesn't have the rookie quarterback [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=909.58s)]
*  and you know, uh [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=912.14s)]
*  Bo nix these nuts they have been they have been throwing the football all over the place and we're seeing the version of him [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=914.38s)]
*  That kind of makes sense, right? He's he's throwing picks multiple picks [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=921.26s)]
*  uh every week, uh bo nix these nuts and the the uh [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=925.34s)]
*  Denver broncos the only thing would be with their defense they're getting riley moss back [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=930.38s)]
*  So they they had two of their last three games [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=935.26s)]
*  They gave up they gave up 32 points to jamis and they gave up 34 points to justin herbert [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=937.5s)]
*  Their secondary was getting eaten up if riley moss comes back and they and he's able to go up against jamar chase [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=942.06s)]
*  That's an incredible matchup [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=948.22s)]
*  But I love all the other weapons that cincinnati moss is back by the way [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=950.54s)]
*  I was checking out my buddy gus my buddy guys who? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=955.5799999999999s)]
*  The only person in my life who truly knows the broncos [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=958.6999999999999s)]
*  And he was telling me when moss got hurt. We're in major trouble. This guy levi wallace is a disaster [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=962.06s)]
*  Yeah, levi wallace has been cut released. He's not even on the team anymore. So long levi moss is back [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=966.54s)]
*  So I feel like that I know it's one guy, but I really feel like that's gonna flip their secondary [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=971.9s)]
*  He's an important guy. Yeah, there'd be no doubt [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=976.6999999999999s)]
*  Um, there's some other cases for them. Do you have more in your case? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=979.66s)]
*  Because I was no that's it. I'll stop now. I mean since daddy hasn't been good at home [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=983.02s)]
*  So I prefer to not lay any points at all. Just let them you know win the game [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=986.7s)]
*  Cincinnati money line was my preferred play [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=991.1s)]
*  last six weeks denver's fifth and dvoa despite [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=993.82s)]
*  Some of the secondary stuff and despite some of the turnovers by nix [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=997.26s)]
*  cincinnati's 29th against the run their defense [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1001.24s)]
*  cincinnati's 30th qb hits [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1004.76s)]
*  So basically this is the perfect team for denver to play with bow nix with the way [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1007.82s)]
*  Kind of how up and down they've been this is a team that will not pressure him hit him [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1012.62s)]
*  They're just not going to do anything [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1016.14s)]
*  um denver's defense [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1017.9s)]
*  They're [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1020.6999999999999s)]
*  You know first and hits first and hurries. They're going to be able to pressure the the [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1021.66s)]
*  The bangles to offensive line not exactly like a juggernaut. No, no, I mean, you know a strat a strip sack [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1025.9s)]
*  Fumble last week against the browns that that helped [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1033.98s)]
*  Uh me lose a nice teaser bet on on the cincinnati, uh team total that was 24 [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1037.74s)]
*  Well, then the dallas game the week before dallas was going to beat them [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1045.1s)]
*  Yeah, right dallas was going to dallas was pressuring them and doing stuff. So I look at cincis wins [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1049.26s)]
*  Here are the quarterbacks. Have you done this? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1056.22s)]
*  No [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1058.62s)]

*  It's not great. I don't think since he's good [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1077.5s)]
*  Yeah, is where i'm really landing and I I think we think they're good because burrows good [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1081.1000000000001s)]
*  No other real aspect of their team is good other than the receivers and burrow now [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1085.74s)]
*  You can make the counter case when they have chasen higgins together with burrow [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1089.26s)]
*  They've just been really good and been able to move the ball [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1092.78s)]
*  I get it, but [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1095.3400000000001s)]
*  I kind of like the denver plus three [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1097.02s)]
*  I don't mind the points [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1099.5800000000002s)]
*  I I really don't mind grabbing the points and there was a minute when it was three and a half and that got stashed up [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1100.94s)]
*  So it's down down to three and I really do kind of understand the case [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1106.38s)]
*  It's it's a it's a rookie quarterback on the road in bad weather game, right in bad weather [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1111.02s)]
*  But to if you want to argue the other side [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1117.66s)]
*  We [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1119.9s)]
*  What other good on the road the denver's been good on the road this year [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1121.42s)]
*  They beat tampa in tampa, but they beat the jets in new york [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1125.26s)]
*  10 days rest [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1129.42s)]
*  Yeah extra rest for shawn paton nine days rest where they play whatever it's extra [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1130.7s)]
*  It's extra rest for them and short rest for cincy because since he's on saturday game shawn paton versus zack taylor [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1135.02s)]
*  Yep [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1140.94s)]
*  Well, that's like it market it did coach in the super bowl [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1142.38s)]
*  this one [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1146.3000000000002s)]
*  This one I love [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1148.62s)]
*  The all la money parlay. Yes. This is wonderful. Great rams home for the cardinals [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1150.22s)]
*  All the rams have to do is win and they win the uh win the nfc west [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1155.8999999999999s)]
*  chargers at the paths [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1160.28s)]
*  All they have to do is win. They're minus four and a half [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1162.54s)]
*  And there's some subtle cases against them right there are offenses in that kid [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1165.98s)]
*  Yeah, they have trouble getting first downs. It's the type of team like even if they had a lead [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1170.22s)]
*  drake may in the second half like [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1174.7s)]
*  Doing stuff [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1177.1000000000001s)]
*  There's a lad mcconkey piece that I don't think can be undersold with the fact that the pats had that pick [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1178.7s)]
*  traded back three spots for a guy [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1184.6200000000001s)]
*  Um who basically doesn't play who had played three snaps mcconkey's just him running a mock in this game is almost a lock [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1187.3400000000001s)]
*  I don't know what the player props are for him [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1193.9s)]
*  but uh [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1196.38s)]
*  Chargers need the game [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1197.82s)]
*  Rams need the game [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1200.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and it it just feels like a classic la money parlay and it's minus 114 on fandle and I would like to partake [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1202.6999999999998s)]
*  Well, let me ask you this. Let's go ahead and do that and let's do it [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1209.7399999999998s)]
*  In a meaningful increment because we both are our believers and that's some some fantastic [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1213.34s)]
*  I mean, you know the other sort of side to this remember how good favorites have been money line favorites have been [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1218.78s)]
*  Absolutely crushing this season favorites 75 since week five [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1225.7199999999998s)]
*  Uh in terms of outright wins [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1230.8600000000001s)]
*  And and favorites have been covering it nearly like 56 or 57 percent since week five [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1234.46s)]
*  Like both of those are you look back 25 30 years and then those rates are all the way up there [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1240.46s)]
*  So we're just doing the thing that's staring us in the face that helped us make money last week [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1246.0600000000002s)]
*  Helped us make money on christmas. We're gonna make some more money on saturday, but I want to just add another wrinkle [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1250.94s)]
*  Let's go ahead and do whatever you want on that rams chargers [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1256.7s)]
*  We have to put the colts in colts have to be a leg in every money line parlay that we do every really any kind [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1259.42s)]
*  Of combination the colts have to be in every one of them just on the money line colts beating the giants outright [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1266.06s)]
*  Has to be an element of it. Well that and that goes back. I had the colts [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1272.6200000000001s)]
*  Um that goes back to what we talked about earlier, which is certain teams are just done winning games this is [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1276.7s)]
*  The new york giants are one of those teams I assume we're out we are done we are done [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1283.74s)]
*  You had them in the uh ringer sunday pregame last year [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1289.18s)]
*  Our last last week. Yeah, and I I was choosing it was dumb. I had already chosen carolina [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1292.22s)]
*  It was it was plus 350. It was right. That's you knew within a quarter [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1297.34s)]
*  It's like oh the giants are done for the season the pig the juulock pick six. That was it. That was it [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1301.8999999999999s)]
*  That was the end. So are you saying? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1306.94s)]
*  We anchor strategy a little bit. Yeah chargers rams [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1309.02s)]
*  Oh anchor strategy [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1311.98s)]
*  Okay to me the anchor is the colts because i'll put the colts with anybody [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1314.14s)]
*  The entire yeah, but that here's what makes me nervous about that. I'm anthony richardson. I just can't get there [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1318.38s)]
*  If there's any quarterback who's ready to just single-handedly kill all of our week 17 parlay's and teasers. It's him [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1325.82s)]
*  So I I just want to proceed with caution think about that like him not michael penex last week, but anthony [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1331.82s)]
*  Richard in this week. Yeah [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1338.38s)]
*  Sorry a couple things with that rams game really quick [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1340.5400000000002s)]
*  Rams are sixth in dvoa last six weeks. Thanks to erin shots for that [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1343.9s)]
*  They won eight of their last 10 and I don't think people realize how grim this cardinal situation got [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1347.5s)]
*  Missing both of their starting tackles on offense. They're like they're pulling practice squads in [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1353.0200000000002s)]
*  Practice squad guys in that are now going to be starting for them. James connor is hurt [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1357.9s)]
*  Might play might not play [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1362.38s)]
*  Their defense is falling apart hubbard had 152 yards last week carolina scored 36 on them [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1364.5400000000002s)]
*  sure did it just as grim and there's a reason the line is where it is and [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1370.5400000000002s)]
*  Uh, because initially I was like, oh cards upset baby and I looked at all the number I was like, oh my god [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1376.3000000000002s)]
*  This is no way they're winning layer on top of that all of the mcveigh stuff [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1381.42s)]
*  15 and two against the spread in his last 17 december games 25 10 and one all time in december mcveigh [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1386.3000000000002s)]
*  The rams against the cardinals the rams kick the cardinal's ass [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1393.8200000000002s)]
*  12-4 and 1 against the spread over the last eight years against arizona [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1397.98s)]
*  10-2 and 1 when they're a favorite against the spread the la rams i'm laying the points with them [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1402.1399999999999s)]
*  They're in the money line parlay. They are part of our anchor strategy. We love the rams [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1407.26s)]
*  And it's also kicking ass the last two weeks held both the jets and the 49ers under 10 points now [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1412.22s)]
*  You say oh look at where those are well offenses to the most disappointing teams in the nfl [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1418.3799999999999s)]
*  But still holding nfl teams on the road to under 10 points. That's impressive [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1422.46s)]
*  I think that's a good point [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1427.74s)]
*  I think that's a good point [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1430.62s)]
*  I think that's a good point [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1433.74s)]
*  Chargers pats the case for being nervous about this would be the pats played well against buffalo for about an hour and a half last week [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1436.78s)]
*  I would just point you to 10 horribly game managed coached [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1444.3799999999999s)]
*  Executed plays they can't help themselves [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1450.1399999999999s)]
*  In a row [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1452.7s)]
*  Okay for them to beat the chargers the chargers would really have to fuck the game up [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1453.82s)]
*  And I don't know if they're a fuck the game up team. I mean that would be you would have jared mayo beating jim harbaugh [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1458.06s)]
*  You would have that you would have a team that would decide in week 17 [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1465.34s)]
*  Maybe we shouldn't throw backward passes inside our own 10 [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1470.1399999999999s)]
*  Maybe we should punt down 10 with eight minutes left like [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1475.6599999999999s)]
*  Something would have to dramatically change with the penalties the coaching the execution [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1479.8999999999999s)]
*  Um, I could see them potentially back to recovering that minus four and a half, but I'm not seeing them winning. Yeah [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1484.4599999999998s)]
*  I'm good. We're on the same page. All right, and then the last one I want to talk about you mentioned the uh, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1489.74s)]
*  The colts giants. I mean we don't need to talk about that [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1494.78s)]
*  Eagles cowboys that line has dropped too [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1498.06s)]
*  It was not it was 10 nine and a half all week now. It's seven and a half on finn dual [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1501.1799999999998s)]
*  And I had had a bet that I mailed you last night or this morning. Oh, hold on. I see six and a half [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1505.66s)]
*  Oh shit, it's still dropping. Huh? Something's going on. Yeah six and a half. Well hurts might not play is what's going on [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1512.62s)]
*  Okay, there we go. Um [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1518.1399999999999s)]
*  And I had enough uncertainty [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1520.62s)]
*  Yeah, I wanted to do an alternate [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1522.54s)]
*  Um [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1525.9s)]
*  Alternate bet with dallas to four and a half when it was nine and a half. It was like plus 172. That's now plus 126 [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1527.42s)]
*  um [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1535.42s)]
*  Which I still like more than the six and a half [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1537.02s)]
*  but um [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1540.1399999999999s)]
*  So if we had the cowboys [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1541.9s)]
*  And we do an over of like what? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1544.62s)]
*  37 and a half [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1547.32s)]
*  I don't know. What are you thinking? The total is at 39 and a half. Um [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1549.1s)]
*  in that game, uh as it is I I don't [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1553.98s)]
*  I'm i'm worried. Um [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1558.22s)]
*  What are you worried about? That's just messing with that game [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1560.62s)]

*  Yes, that's exactly what I think. I would have loved dallas. I love dallas at eight and a half [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1568.86s)]
*  I loved them at nine and a half. The 10 was an incredible number now down to six and a half [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1573.34s)]
*  I kind of don't want to mess with it. Um, because philly got enough with picket [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1577.82s)]
*  Of like gay he like picket can play now, right? He got three quarters of real live nfl football [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1583.26s)]

*  I'm not talking make a kenny picket case. No what it's just like philly being ready for the game case [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1593.98s)]
*  That's that's what I mean. That's all i'm saying he's not a guy that's like [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1599.8200000000002s)]

*  That i'm making I I have had enormous success [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1609.3400000000001s)]
*  Riding with the cowboys and i'm so upset that they lost to cincinnati [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1613.5s)]
*  On that money night stupid punt thing their defense since parsis has come back [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1618.24s)]
*  Has been legit good and their secondary is legit good legit good [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1623.2s)]
*  So I couldn't interest you in dallas plus 10 and a half with the over of 30 and a half at minus 115 [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1628.08s)]

*  That's a good one or doubt. Yeah, because I don't want to tease dallas with another team [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1640.16s)]
*  I want to confine it to the game great good. Yeah, me either. That's fine dallas [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1644.8s)]

*  And so they could afford to pay him and keep him under the cell. Yeah [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TIiQ0qmN1s&t=1870.32s)]
