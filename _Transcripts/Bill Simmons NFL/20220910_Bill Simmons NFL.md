# Broncos vs. Seahawks: Can Russ Beat His Old Team? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWU-S_TgqE8)
*  I struggled with the seventh team.
*  One of the reasons I picked Denver was because you're really bullish on Denver.
*  And sometimes I don't totally trust you because I don't know like, oh, he loves the coach.
*  He's probably had bloody Marys with the guy one day and he's just, he's hearing what he wants to hear.
*  With the Denver thing, I actually, it just seems like you like the coach and Russell Wilson.
*  And what else do you like about that Denver team?
*  I love this Denver team this year.
*  That to me is a fan base and an organization that has just been like bristling for an opportunity to be worthy of talking about, worthy of putting on Sunday night.
*  This is a perfect marriage of quarterback and Russell Wilson, who is two years removed from having any real success and wants to prove himself and has been, trust me, not only the model citizen,
*  but like the model franchise leader since he got there in the morning at all crazy hours, the stuff that you heard about Stafford last year.
*  And then a head coach who was, you know, Aaron Rodgers, his right hand man last year and the year before in his MVP seasons, who I believe is going to draft up a really good offense.
*  Then you put in the new ownership group, an ownership group that is already putting in a ton of resources.
*  They were in purgatory the last few years with the Boland family, not knowing what the future of the team was that I don't think that's a great place to work into work environment every day.
*  Now they've got an owner who's willing to spend money, owner who's got a lot of money and an owner who's able to mispronounce the last name of the commissioner and get away with that because, well, that's just what it is.
*  You put in those three things and then you just add in a fan base and a home field advantage that has been dormant for seven years.
*  I think, you know, Denver's having a sports moment, whether it be the avalanche or joke itch and what he's doing with the Nuggets and the football team's been irrelevant.
*  I feel like this is the perfect marriage, perfect quarterback, perfect head coach for this organization.
*  And I think this is the year that we all start talking about guys like Justin Simmons, who's fantastic, Sir Tan, who's fantastic, Cortland Sutton and Jerry Judy, who haven't reached their full potential because they haven't had a quarterback in their careers.
*  And I think it's the perfect moment for Jevonte Williams to make that leap where it's like he's in the conversation.
*  They've had the players, they have the organization, now they've got the coach and the quarterback.
*  And I think they're certainly worthy of playoff consideration.
*  You had Jevonte as your number one breakout guy.
*  Number one.
*  One of the best segments you do is that top ten, my top ten breakout guys in the NFL.
*  You count them down, you've had some good success with it.
*  Jevonte was number one.
*  Jevonte was going way too high in every auction I was in this week because there's still that Melvin Gordon piece where you spend all that money and you're watching the Broncos game.
*  And then it's like, all right, Melvin Gordon is going to play this series.
*  And you're like, what?
*  Jevonte Williams.
*  Just play him.
*  I liked your Denver sports moment thing.
*  There's one other piece.
*  And this is what pushed her over the top for me with the seventh seed.
*  Yeah.
*  The hit piece coming out of Seattle about Russell Wilson that ESPN had on Wednesday.
*  I was like, here we go, baby.
*  No ads coming from somewhere.
*  You usually have a piece like that in June, July.
*  That one was nice and close to the season.
*  It was all the stuff we had assumed and thought.
*  And we knew there was a weird relationship there for three, four years.
*  It was like kind of watching a bad marriage from afar that everyone was pretending was fine.
*  But the moment the couple separates, you're like, I knew it.
*  I knew that we're going to separate.
*  And with that, when that piece came out, it also backed up a lot of the stuff that my eyes saw that I didn't think he was moving around in the same way.
*  So if that doesn't light a fire on him, Peter Schrager, I don't know what does.
*  There's no way he didn't read it.
*  There's no way he wasn't pissed off about it.
*  He hears it all.
*  And I'll tell you, like the same things were being said about Brady two years ago and the same things are being said about Stafford a year ago.
*  When Brady left New England, there was a lot of people who were like, I mean, look, Brady looked fine.
*  They got to the playoffs, but it was no longer going to be the Tom Brady of old.
*  He went to Super Bowl.
*  Stafford, a lot of people were rolling their eyes saying, yeah, but it's a 32 year old Matt Stafford who can't win shit.
*  OK, he went to Super Bowl like Russell's 32.
*  Yeah, so 38.
*  Russell Wilson is he's still that dude.
*  And look, I know that there's a lot of people out there who are going to doubt and criticize and I could be wrong and they could go six and 11.
*  I just think the coaching quarterback alone bumps them three to four wins.
*  And if that's what they do, they're going to the playoffs.
*  Favorite game of the week to watch is going to be Seahawks Denver.
*  I can't wait.
*  We talked a little bit about this on the Friday show.
*  But Ross is one of the most interesting players of the last 10 years of football.
*  Like so much of how we understand the game of quarterbacking now is seen through the perspective of how Russell Wilson has played, what he has and hasn't done in Seattle.
*  We finally get to see him outside of Seattle and the Seahawks feel like they're chomping at the bit for this game.
*  The way Pete Carroll is talking about like, yeah, we know the guy.
*  I kind of know what he does.
*  Nobody doesn't do.
*  There is a this game is in Seattle.
*  There is a way that this becomes like a Seahawks blowout.
*  I have the Seahawks money line at 225.
*  I think that this is going to be a close game and I think Seattle is going to embarrass Russ and I can't wait to see it.
*  This sounds like the perfect piece of our of a possible underdog parlay.
*  Yeah, I think in terms of live dogs this week, to me, it's like the Jags are absolutely going to be Washington.
*  I'm very surprised that they're not favored in that game, but that's small.
*  It's like 120, 125 right now in terms of actual big fun dogs.
*  You're Seattle Seahawks, man.
*  Like, I don't think it's going to be a pretty game.
*  I don't think it's going to be a fun game, but there's a way that they this defense with with with a little bit of attitude and this this fan base as well as in Seattle just bullies Ross for four quarters.
*  And I swear it would be fun to watch if they do.
*  Well, we also have the ultimate Geno Smith fan at the ringer, Stephen Ruiz, who had a take.
*  He did his QB rankings this week and he put Geno Smith ahead of two.
*  I was honest. I was in awe.
*  Like sometimes people have takes or stances and you're just like, I'm in awe.
*  Like I just that that went to a level that I didn't even know human beings could go.
*  And just to put that in print and actually believe it, I was in awe since before he worked at the ringer and I started working at the ringer.
*  We were hired in the same month.
*  Stephen's one of my favorite writers in the world, and it's because I am a fence sitter.
*  I sit around and I go, will the Niners cover six and a half against the Bears?
*  Yeah, they're probably better.
*  Maybe that's maybe that whatever.
*  And Stephen just goes, Geno's better than Tua.
*  And I just wish I had that in my DNA.
*  I wish I could.
*  I physically can't.
*  It makes my skin crawl.
*  But he's got the genes, got the juice.
*  I don't.
