# Conference Title Leans and Early NFL Draft Nuggets With Todd McShay | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs)
*  Todd McShay is here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=0.0s)]
*  I hope you've been listening to the McShay show, which we've had on the [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1.28s)]
*  ringer for the last couple of months during a very action packed college [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=3.6s)]
*  football season, lots to get to. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=7.0200000000000005s)]
*  First of all, welcome to the ringer belatedly. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=8.6s)]
*  Great to have you on the pod. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=10.5s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  I it's been fun. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Appreciate you. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=14.8s)]
*  Uh, you're supporting all of it and we're having a good time. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=15.48s)]
*  It's, it's been a whole different world, right? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=18.92s)]
*  Like I didn't know anything about this world, but we've, we've enjoyed it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=21.06s)]
*  And now we're kind of turning the page. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=24.6s)]
*  We have the NFL playoffs and then the NFL draft. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=26.32s)]
*  And so we're kind of hitting our sweet spot. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=28.92s)]
*  Well, I have a vested interest in this draft, which we'll get to later. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=31.720000000000002s)]
*  Did the right team win the college football championship? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=34.88s)]
*  Yeah, they did. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=37.56s)]
*  And it's what's wild too, is like all the complaints about the 12 team [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=38.88s)]
*  playoff and all the adjustments we have to make in the seedings and mass. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=42.34s)]
*  And it should never be conference champions. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=47.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day, Ohio state wouldn't have been in it in the previous, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=49.52s)]
*  you know, 14 playoff structure. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=54.2s)]
*  And Ohio state was clearly the best team. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=56.44s)]
*  And it took them going on a run. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=59.76s)]
*  The Michigan loss is a Michigan thing for Ohio state. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  It's not reflective of the program and what they are. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=65.56s)]
*  I mean, that's, that's almost a head space that they're going to have to, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=68.44s)]
*  have to deal with, but, but that was the best team. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=71.0s)]
*  And it was, everyone talked about, well, they bought a 20 million dollar roster. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=74.0s)]
*  Well, they just use a lot of that 20 million to keep the guys there that were [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=77.72s)]
*  there on the defensive side and yeah, they added a running back in Quinshaw, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=81.82s)]
*  junks and their quarterback, Will Howard was a really good fit for what they do. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=85.28s)]
*  Um, but ultimately the vast majority of that team was there and they just kept a [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=89.88s)]
*  lot of guys from going in the NFL and having to take pay cuts to do so. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=93.92s)]
*  Wait, you know, you were one of the rare college and NFL guys. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=98.68s)]
*  Roussela is like this too. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=102.28s)]
*  There's a few of them. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=103.32s)]
*  Gun to your head. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=105.4s)]
*  Which one do you like more? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=106.2s)]
*  Like if you, if you could only be stuck with one for the rest of your life, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=107.44s)]
*  which one would you pick? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=110.64s)]
*  Gun to head, I would say college football. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=112.84s)]
*  I love, I love the person. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=115.4s)]
*  Why college football? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=116.56s)]
*  What is it? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=117.44s)]
*  It's, it's the, I guess I grew up on it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=118.4s)]
*  Like my grandfather worked with Bo Schembechler and I like going out. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=120.8s)]
*  I grew up in, in, in Boston, outside of Boston, Swanscott small town, north of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=124.76s)]
*  Boston, but he had worked, he lived in, in Ohio and helped the recruiting [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=128.48s)]
*  area of Northeast Ohio. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=134.68s)]
*  And, um, and so I was around that, around that Michigan program and kind of. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=136.12s)]
*  Just understood like, you always see like the pageantry and that, but it's [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=142.04s)]
*  like just how important that is. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=145.72s)]
*  And it was weird growing up here, right? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=147.88s)]
*  Cause like it's all pro sports here in New England, all pro sports. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=149.95999999999998s)]
*  Except for the one flutie run. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=153.55999999999997s)]
*  We had that little flutie intersection and that was about it for, for college football. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=159.6s)]
*  And so just being around that, I kind of was introduced to something that was [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=160.27999999999997s)]
*  different than what we grew up around, you know, living in this area. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  I just have always loved like going to games and the tailgating and how important [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=167.8s)]
*  it is and the flags flying as you're driving through a town and the crowd and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  the atmosphere, it's just home to me. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  It really is. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=178.96s)]
*  But the personnel part, like I just, I became obsessed with in my twenties when [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=180.28s)]
*  I started in this business, um, just evaluating art, which of these guys can [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  actually go play at the next level and building a roster. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=190.76000000000002s)]
*  And so that's kind of how it all developed for me. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=193.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, so last year we had these three quarterbacks and it was so much fun to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=196.32s)]
*  talk about them and everybody kind of agreed ceiling wise, Caleb has to be first. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=199.64000000000001s)]
*  That was like what everybody came away with this guy. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=204.44s)]
*  He's my homes ish. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=206.88s)]
*  There's some leadership stuff, potentially there's some immaturity stuff, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=207.88s)]
*  but he's gotta be the pick. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  And yet there were some other people were like, ah, check May's little Josh [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=215.0s)]
*  Allen and then Jayden Daniels was the other one. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=218.28s)]
*  And the reason people seem to be down on Daniels was the frame. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=221.48000000000002s)]
*  Could he be durable enough? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=226.36s)]
*  Could he handle it? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  But then everybody was pointing to last year and saying, this guy was amazing [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=228.8s)]
*  last year, like if this guy can do in the pros, what he did in college, this guy is [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=233.48000000000002s)]
*  going to be an amazing quarterback and durability is question. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=237.52s)]
*  Did this succeed? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=241.04s)]
*  What you even thought, like whatever you had as a ceiling for Daniels coming [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=241.96s)]
*  in, what's happened this year? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=245.24s)]
*  Did you see any version of this happening? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=246.32s)]
*  Not this version, man. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=249.32s)]
*  I mean. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=250.88s)]
*  I'll go back to what I said last year before the draft. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=253.48s)]
*  If you're dropped on this planet and you could only base your evaluation off of [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=256.4s)]
*  one year of tape, like the 2023 season, Jayden Daniels was clearly the better [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=260.84s)]
*  prospect, right? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=267.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=268.36s)]
*  But, but throughout the process, there was Jayden Daniels at Arizona state, which [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=268.52s)]
*  was kind of this running around backyard football, all about his legs. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=273.71999999999997s)]
*  Occasionally he'd pop a pass down the field and then he got to LSU. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=278.56s)]
*  And even early on there, like, I remember being on the field with Brian Kelly [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=284.84s)]
*  before the, um, the Tennessee game. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=288.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=292.24s)]
*  And Tennessee came in big favorites and they wound up blowing out LSU in that [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=293.12s)]
*  game, but I remember being on the field with him and watching Jayden and having [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=296.72s)]
*  to watch his tape and just saying like, what do you see in practice that I'm not [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=300.92s)]
*  seeing because it looks like he can make all the throws, but he just doesn't seem [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=304.32s)]
*  to trust it and the anticipation isn't there and all that. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=307.72s)]
*  And he said, he said, watch the first play of this game. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=311.20000000000005s)]
*  Just watch because it we're forcing him to make this throw. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm not going to tell you where it's going, but we're going to force him to [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=318.16s)]
*  make this throw because we're trying to prove to him that if you just trust your [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=320.88000000000005s)]
*  read and your eyes and you get the ball out on time, you're special. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=325.32000000000005s)]
*  Like you're different than anything we've been around or seen. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=329.04s)]
*  And so the first play of the game comes in, of course I'm on the side of like [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=332.52000000000004s)]
*  peeking over and it's a, it's a deep comeback route to the left, to the left [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=335.32s)]
*  side, and he gets back top of his drop and just rips it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=340.04s)]
*  And if it gets picked, it's a pick six. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=344.52s)]
*  And at that point he hadn't thrown an interception and everyone in the local [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=346.52s)]
*  media was just all of this. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=350.48s)]
*  Jayden Daniels is great. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=351.92s)]
*  He hasn't thrown an interception through five games. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=353.08s)]
*  How good has he been? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=355.24s)]
*  And Brian's point was like, I can't wait for him to throw an interception. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=356.44s)]
*  Like it's driving me fucking crazy. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=359.52s)]
*  The media is talking about the interception thing, but the reason he's [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=362.28s)]
*  not trusting is he's so concerned about throwing a pick. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=364.92s)]
*  So anyway, ball comes out perfect throw right on time completion. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=367.56s)]
*  And you saw it there. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=371.6s)]
*  Like that was like the first step in his confidence of like, you know what? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=372.56s)]
*  If I trust what I'm seeing in my instincts, I can build from here. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=376.84000000000003s)]
*  And he just kept getting better. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=381.0s)]
*  And then the following season was 2023 and he just took off. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=382.08000000000004s)]
*  It's funny that we've, and you know, I'm in my mid fifties now and it still [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=386.92s)]
*  doesn't feel like we figured out a valuation of like the best basketball [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=391.24s)]
*  prospects, quarterbacks. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=394.71999999999997s)]
*  I think when we get to like, you know, like Abdul Carter, pass rushers, we [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=397.8s)]
*  have a pretty good sense of like, yeah, this guy's probably going to come in [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=401.71999999999997s)]
*  and be really good, but the quarterback thing, so much of it seems to depend on [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=404.36s)]
*  situation, what your college experience was, where are you going into, who your [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=408.15999999999997s)]
*  coach is when you get there the first couple of years. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=412.8s)]
*  And I think of like the situation Daniels was in versus what Drake May was in, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=415.15999999999997s)]
*  where he was like F minus offensive line. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=419.08s)]
*  No receivers, the worst coach is possible. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=421.36s)]
*  And he's just running for his life for four quarters. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=424.4s)]
*  And then Daniels who had kind of an overqualified offensive coordinator, a [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=426.44s)]
*  good head coach, a lot of veterans around him, a team that trusted him. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=430.92s)]
*  He had five years in college and all that led to like something really good. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=435.12s)]
*  But then he got hurt what five weeks, six weeks in, he took a hit. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=439.71999999999997s)]
*  Didn't seem like he was the same for five. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=443.36s)]
*  And I was like, well, this is why we were a little nervous. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=444.88s)]
*  Could his body hold up? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=447.08s)]
*  Now I'm thinking about picking them to beat the Eagles. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=448.84s)]
*  And he, like, he looks that good compared to what we're watching. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=452.03999999999996s)]
*  And I want to talk to you about what's going on with hurts too, but it does feel [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=455.44s)]
*  realistic that he could just win three straight playoff games in a row. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=459.2s)]
*  And I don't like for a rookie quarterback to do that. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=462.47999999999996s)]
*  Is that inconceivable to you? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=466.24s)]
*  It is inconceivable because history says it doesn't like, it's, it's almost [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=469.71999999999997s)]
*  impossible to happen, right? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=473.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=474.91999999999996s)]
*  Like what he's doing now, Bill is it's so far beyond what you would, you can. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=475.71999999999997s)]
*  That it's that you're allowed to expect from a rookie quarterback. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=481.47999999999996s)]
*  Like I went back and looked, right? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=485.76s)]
*  Like no rookie quarterback has ever led his team to a Superbowl. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=487.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=490.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=491.12s)]
*  There have been five others who have led, led their team to a conference championship. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=491.88s)]
*  And I want to lead, I want to rip off these names for you. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=498.28s)]
*  Sean King, Ben Roethlisberger. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=501.03999999999996s)]
*  And I want you to think back like when they actually were rookies. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=503.84s)]
*  His game manager, Ben Roethlisberger. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=506.68s)]
*  Correct. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=508.76s)]
*  Joe Flacco, same deal. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=510.03999999999996s)]
*  Mark Sanchez, Brock Purdy. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=511.88s)]
*  Now I want you to think about what we just saw last week. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=515.1999999999999s)]
*  And then there's a whole other list of guys in their second year, six of them [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=519.36s)]
*  since 2000 have actually in their second year as quarterbacks have led their teams [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=522.6s)]
*  to a Superbowl, Brady, Roethlisberger, Kaepernick, Russell Wilson, Joe Burrow. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=526.68s)]
*  And Purdy, I would say of that group, Burrow probably carried more of the [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=531.6s)]
*  offensive load on his shoulders than any of those other guys. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=537.6s)]
*  I mean, Brady back then, we were protecting Brady. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=540.68s)]
*  You know, it was all about. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=543.56s)]
*  Brady was in close to Brady in 2001. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=544.1999999999999s)]
*  Now. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=546.92s)]
*  And so then you think about what, what Jaden's doing and under pressure and not [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=547.28s)]
*  just beating the pressure with his legs, but with his arm. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=553.24s)]
*  And then you think about like the vast majority of the run plays too. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=556.12s)]
*  I think this kind of goes unnoticed in the NFL with how quick the defenses are [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=559.28s)]
*  and how fast the action of play is. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=563.56s)]
*  He's having to make reads in the run game too, with his own read option and all [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=565.72s)]
*  the, the possibilities there. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=569.0400000000001s)]
*  So every snap he is making decisions that a rookie quarterback usually doesn't [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=570.6400000000001s)]
*  have to have that much load put on them. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=577.24s)]
*  And he's doing it at such a ridiculous level. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=580.2s)]
*  That's why this is by far, I think by far in my lifetime, the best rookie [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=582.32s)]
*  quarterback performance I've ever seen. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=587.8000000000001s)]
*  And CJ Stroud, it was awesome, but this is different, man. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=590.8000000000001s)]
*  And the, and the supporting cast is not to the level that it should be for a [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=594.12s)]
*  rookie quarterback to have this success. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=598.64s)]
*  And honestly, I like Washington. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=600.6s)]
*  I'm going to go with them. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=606.64s)]
*  I think I am specials. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=608.24s)]
*  I think something special is happening and I trust, here's the weird part. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=609.48s)]
*  I trust him more than I trust Jalen Hertz. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=613.08s)]
*  So that's, I have this playoff manifesto with all these rules. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=616.28s)]
*  And one of the rules is you really got to look at the quarterbacks. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=619.4s)]
*  Look at both sides, imagine betting on the game and just going down [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=623.4s)]
*  the four quarters with each guy. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=627.5999999999999s)]
*  And I want to talk about Hertz in a second, cause the stuff that's going [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=629.68s)]
*  on with him is alarming and there were some really good videos and [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=632.92s)]
*  pieces about in the last week. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=635.9599999999999s)]
*  The Daniel's piece, the only you listed, we talked about this last week on my pod, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=638.0s)]
*  just like the Brady 2001 and Mahomes his first full year. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=641.4799999999999s)]
*  And I think the Mahomes his first full year is the only real [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=645.64s)]
*  comparison that I can remember. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=648.4799999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=650.4399999999999s)]
*  I honestly with Marino who was amazing, but you know, we, in the mid eighties, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=651.16s)]
*  he was probably on TV three times where we had football. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=657.3199999999999s)]
*  I can't say I was like a Dan Marino expert. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=660.92s)]
*  He would play the Pats or the jets and you would get one of those games, maybe. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=663.16s)]
*  But Mahomes we were there for, and he was good enough to win the [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=667.8s)]
*  Superbowl that year and they got really lucky. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=671.4399999999999s)]
*  Like the D-Fords jumped off sides or the Pat or Brady throws an interception. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=673.4s)]
*  The Pats lose that game. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=677.0s)]
*  Mahomes would have gone on the Superbowl that year. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=678.28s)]
*  Burroughs another one that I think felt like he was arrived and ready to go. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=680.2800000000001s)]
*  And he was going to be in our lives for the next 15 years. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=684.44s)]
*  And I just think Daniel's hit that point even before the Detroit game. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=687.1600000000001s)]
*  It was just clear. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=691.2s)]
*  He was going to be in our lives. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=691.84s)]
*  The part that was amazing to me is that it felt like the [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=693.24s)]
*  tray could have run for 10 yards of carry. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=696.44s)]
*  I'm sure they're looking at the tape going, how did we lose that game? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=698.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=701.48s)]
*  That how did we ever not score a touchdown every time we had the ball? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=701.9200000000001s)]
*  So now I look at Philly and it's like, all right, are they just going to [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=706.08s)]
*  rush for 300 yards? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=708.84s)]
*  Maybe Hertz doesn't have to do anything, but I don't, I don't like trusting [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=710.0s)]
*  QBs who are playing like shit and he's playing like shit. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=714.2800000000001s)]
*  He is. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=720.0400000000001s)]
*  It's going to be interesting. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=720.5600000000001s)]
*  Like, I don't want to go too deep in the, in the mud, but like, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=721.5600000000001s)]
*  please do. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=725.0s)]
*  We're here to go in the mud. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=726.32s)]
*  Philly lives on first down running the football. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=728.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=731.44s)]
*  I think I've read like 71% of the time on first down, they've run the [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=732.32s)]
*  football in the postseason and it was damn near that close in the regular season. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=735.48s)]
*  It's all about staying on schedule. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=740.28s)]
*  And I think in part because they don't trust their quarterback, right? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=742.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=746.64s)]
*  Because if we're in third, they're, they're one for 11 on third down conversions [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=747.6s)]
*  in the postseason when it's third and seven or longer, what does that tell you? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=752.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=756.6800000000001s)]
*  How about the explosive plays he's missed in the two games where he's had AJ [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=757.12s)]
*  open deep and just like either threw it out of bounds or was laid on the throw. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=761.88s)]
*  That safety he took against the Rams in the second half was one of the worst [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=765.96s)]
*  quarterback plays of the year. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=770.32s)]
*  It was unbelievable that that happened. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=771.76s)]
*  That's what would happen if, you know, if it's like somebody who's replacing [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=774.08s)]
*  Deshaun Watson on the Browns, like that kind of level quarterback. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=777.8000000000001s)]
*  It's like this Jalen Hurts has been to a Superbowl. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=781.24s)]
*  Like the one thing and the other time when he knocked him out of field goal [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=784.2s)]
*  range, cause he took a sack, like this is like basic QB shit. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=787.32s)]
*  Like don't, don't make your situation worse. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=790.32s)]
*  Like just get out of it. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=793.0s)]
*  He can't even seem to do that. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=794.0s)]
*  So, and I think the Eagle fans are really aware of it, but also feel like they can [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=795.4000000000001s)]
*  rush for 330 yards on Sunday. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=798.6800000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=800.8000000000001s)]
*  And they could, I mean, they could, but I also like Washington has gotten to the [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=801.44s)]
*  point where they're one of the top teams in the NFL, the last like second half of [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=806.0s)]
*  the season and in the postseason with like run blitz on first down. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=809.6400000000001s)]
*  So like it could become a war of, all right, when does Philly take a chance, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=813.32s)]
*  play action first down and can Jalen cash in? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=817.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=821.48s)]
*  You know, and, and again, if you're betting on Jalen, is that the bet you want to [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=822.24s)]
*  make? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=827.48s)]
*  Well, so if you're making the case for Washington and I think I'm going to make [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=828.24s)]
*  it when I do million dollar picks, you figure spread in that game, by the way, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=831.4000000000001s)]
*  is it up to six and a half? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=835.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=836.48s)]
*  It's, you know, probably seven. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=836.8000000000001s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=838.36s)]
*  But, um, you figure it'd be the same recipe at the D against Detroit where each [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=838.88s)]
*  side's going to have seven possessions. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=844.0s)]
*  We're gonna take our time. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=846.2s)]
*  We're gonna move the ball down the field every fourth and two, fourth and three. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=847.2s)]
*  We're going for it. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=850.36s)]
*  We're gonna complete 70% of our passes. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=851.9200000000001s)]
*  The clocks can be moving, moving, moving. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=854.12s)]
*  We'll hang around. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=856.4s)]
*  Maybe we're up 10, seven in the second quarter. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=857.0400000000001s)]
*  Philly has a turnover and now we have the ball again. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=859.48s)]
*  Now we're now at 17, seven 13th now hurts has to start making place. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=861.9200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=866.32s)]
*  And that's their scenario to win the game, which is very similar to the Detroit [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=866.88s)]
*  scenario. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=869.8000000000001s)]
*  The Eagle scenario is just, we're up 10, nothing. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=870.48s)]
*  We're running the ball. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=873.52s)]
*  We're chewing up clock. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=874.48s)]
*  Daniel's comes out. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=875.76s)]
*  We get like one stop. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=876.8000000000001s)]
*  We rushed through the middle. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=878.12s)]
*  We get, and that now all of a sudden it's 13, nothing. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=878.96s)]
*  And now we can just run the ball, run the ball, run the ball, play action. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=881.6800000000001s)]
*  We're home. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=884.32s)]
*  So I see the two sides. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=885.8000000000001s)]
*  I just feel more comfortable with the Daniel side. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=887.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=891.96s)]
*  Especially with that number, you know, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=892.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=895.16s)]
*  Cause it feels like either team can win the game. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=895.4s)]
*  So if that's the case, I'd rather just take the six and a half. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=897.32s)]
*  I'd love to see Washington jump them early. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=901.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=904.4s)]
*  You know, a quick strike early in the game, kind of knock Philly back on its [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=905.0s)]
*  heels. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=909.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=911.1999999999999s)]
*  I, I, I just think what momentum's crazy. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=911.64s)]
*  Confidence is, is like, is so much of this and we've, we've lived through it [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=915.56s)]
*  our whole lifetime. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=920.92s)]
*  Like when teams get on a run, forget the seeds, forget the Vegas spreads. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=921.92s)]
*  Like there's something about that momentum and like the belief in what we're [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=927.2399999999999s)]
*  doing. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=932.0s)]
*  And it just feels like Washington has that now again, they could walk into a [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=932.64s)]
*  buzzsaw. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=936.0s)]
*  Philly jump gets out and has a big play early on and now, now they can run the [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=937.6s)]
*  football and then you get a lead. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=941.0s)]
*  But, but I just, I don't know. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=942.96s)]
*  Something special is happening and happening in Washington and I don't want [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=944.44s)]
*  to be on the other side of it anymore. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=947.64s)]
*  Well, were you in Massachusetts during the Oh one Pat's run? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=949.24s)]
*  Uh, Oh one. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=953.2s)]
*  The first Superbowl. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=955.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=956.2800000000001s)]
*  I just moved back from New York. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=956.6800000000001s)]
*  I lived in New York. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=958.12s)]
*  I went to school in Richmond, lived in New York for two years. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=958.72s)]
*  I came back just honestly, I think five, six months before. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=961.96s)]
*  So I was there for the whole run. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=965.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=966.9200000000001s)]
*  It felt like, and it was a little similar where it was an out of nowhere thing. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=967.1600000000001s)]
*  It seemed improbable. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=971.2s)]
*  They were big underdogs each. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=972.2800000000001s)]
*  I mean, they were even bigger underdogs than Washington is. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=973.52s)]
*  And the snow game was the one that officially flipped the narrative. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=976.4000000000001s)]
*  It's like, wait, what's going on here? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=980.0s)]
*  And then they went into Pittsburgh. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=981.52s)]
*  They got, you know, a couple of special teams plays. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=983.5600000000001s)]
*  There was some Pittsburgh turnovers and it was just chip on their shoulder. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=986.48s)]
*  The only people that believe in us are in this locker room and Washington [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=990.0400000000001s)]
*  definitely has some of that. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=993.1600000000001s)]
*  I think the difference is Daniel's is just way ahead of where Brady was. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=994.08s)]
*  Brady game manager, really smart. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=997.6800000000001s)]
*  Didn't turn the ball over, but wasn't, he wasn't really Brady until I think 2005, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1000.4000000000001s)]
*  six range when they really started leaning on him. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1006.5600000000001s)]
*  Yep. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1009.24s)]
*  This Daniel's thing to, to lean on a rookie where he's basically, the [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1009.84s)]
*  offense is hinging on him. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1013.9200000000001s)]
*  It's pretty unusual. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1016.12s)]
*  I will say though, Eckler being back and them having two running backs now, and [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1017.0400000000001s)]
*  just like, it just feels like they can run the ball a little bit. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1021.76s)]
*  And Eckler looked like he had juice, right? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1024.96s)]
*  Yeah, no question. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1026.88s)]
*  Like a couple of years ago, like, you know, when he was, when he was in his, I [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1028.24s)]
*  don't want to say prime, but when he was at his peak, it kind of a couple of his [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1032.28s)]
*  runs, I was like, Oh shit, like Eckler's back. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1036.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1040.16s)]
*  Well, I, we were talking last week when we're on the show and we're trying to [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1040.88s)]
*  figure out could Washington win this game. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1044.92s)]
*  They had a really weird season where they looked really good the first few weeks. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1046.76s)]
*  Then they had Daniel's got hurt. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1050.48s)]
*  They had a couple injuries. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1052.64s)]
*  They had the hail Mary game was lucky. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1053.84s)]
*  And they kind of like, they didn't, weren't stumbling through the middle of [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1056.16s)]
*  the season, but they looked like they were like a rabbit team, the team that [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1058.64s)]
*  looks good for the first two, two and a half months, but then like the last month [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1062.64s)]
*  of the season, they kind of went back to where they were in September and then it [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1065.8799999999999s)]
*  just kept going and going and going. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1069.96s)]
*  So you could think that you could also think they easily could have lost the [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1071.4s)]
*  Tampa if Tampa just converts a second and one and makes three more plays and [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1074.72s)]
*  is up for with two minutes left. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1079.16s)]
*  Um, but I'm with you. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1081.4s)]
*  Like sometimes with football, you get this momentum that's going. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1082.76s)]
*  I guess the question for me on the, in the other conferences, does Buffalo have [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1087.28s)]
*  that too, or Buffalo has had like the turnover stats with them or nuts where [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1091.3600000000001s)]
*  they've never had a game where they've had more turnovers than the other team, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1096.48s)]
*  the whole season, everyone else has done that as one of the Superbowl the game [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1099.2s)]
*  last week, they just have a habit of the other team just shoots themselves in the [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1102.48s)]
*  foot as they're playing them. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1106.96s)]
*  Um, so I wonder like, maybe it could be a Buffalo Washington. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1108.72s)]
*  Yeah, you should have seen this all along. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1113.1200000000001s)]
*  This is, but this is what we've done all year. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1115.6000000000001s)]
*  Why didn't you believe in us? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1117.64s)]
*  Uh, the Josh Allen thing, like it's his time. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1119.8400000000001s)]
*  It's you're going there. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1124.24s)]
*  Cause I think I'm picking Casey. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1125.16s)]
*  Good. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1126.8400000000001s)]
*  Good. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1127.56s)]
*  I want everyone else to, and you know what? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1127.92s)]
*  It's like, it's kind of like when your mom says, okay, like how many times you're [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1131.28s)]
*  going to burn your hand on the stove or how many times you have it. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1134.4399999999998s)]
*  And as life went on, like, I think I've come to realize like I'm going to be the [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1137.52s)]
*  one who's going to burn my hand more, you know, going against the chiefs. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1141.3999999999999s)]
*  You mean, yeah. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1144.76s)]
*  And so maybe it's a me thing, but, but I don't know. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1145.6s)]
*  I here's what the tangible thing that I think is different is the [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1149.72s)]
*  turnover aspect for, for Josh out. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1155.04s)]
*  I also, I talked about this with our guy, Ryan, we're so. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1157.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1160.84s)]
*  Right after it happened. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1161.6799999999998s)]
*  What was it? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1162.76s)]
*  Week 11 was it? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1163.1599999999999s)]
*  Um, Kansas city Buffalo, right? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1164.28s)]
*  30, 21, they beat them. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1166.12s)]
*  I remember watching that game and waiting to see, cause they were up for. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1168.56s)]
*  Buffalo was up for it. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1173.0s)]
*  It's like every time an opponent has, it has a lead over Kansas [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1174.6s)]
*  city in the fourth quarter. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1178.04s)]
*  They get, there's always like that middle of the fourth quarter or like a little [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1179.76s)]
*  bit past the midpoint of the fourth quarter, they get a drive, the opponent does. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1183.1599999999999s)]
*  And, and there's some level of conservative play, whether it's playing [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1188.08s)]
*  for a field goal, whether it's, it's dialing it back, not, not being aggressive. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1193.52s)]
*  The mentality has to be, we're down for, and that's what Buffalo did. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1198.16s)]
*  It was a, they've lost three games to them in the playoffs. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1203.48s)]
*  They've, they've found out, found ways to lose. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1206.76s)]
*  They've had games pulled away from them. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1210.68s)]
*  All of it. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1212.44s)]
*  I saw the kind of the, the switch in the mentality in that, in that week 11 game. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1213.8400000000001s)]
*  Where are we? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1219.6000000000001s)]
*  We've got the ball. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1220.0800000000002s)]
*  I forget exactly when they got it. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1220.64s)]
*  Maybe like six, seven minutes left in the fourth quarter. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1222.0800000000002s)]
*  They're down by four. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1224.0800000000002s)]
*  But if you didn't know the score, you'd say, Oh, they're, I'm sorry. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1225.72s)]
*  They're up by four, but you, if you didn't know the score, you would have said they're [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1229.1200000000001s)]
*  down by four points in this game. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1232.16s)]
*  Cause it's not, not by three. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1234.16s)]
*  No, they're down by four is the mentality they had. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1236.3200000000002s)]
*  Cause they had to score a touchdown. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1239.68s)]
*  And, and they drove the field. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1241.8s)]
*  They went forward on fourth downs. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1244.6s)]
*  They were aggressive the entire time and they put the game away. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1246.04s)]
*  Cause what teams do all the time in that fourth quarter drive is they take for great. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1249.2s)]
*  Like it's, it's assumed it absolutely has to be assumed that when my homes gets the [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1254.32s)]
*  ball, they're going to, it doesn't matter how much time's left, they're going to [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1258.76s)]
*  score and they're going to score a touchdown. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1261.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1263.68s)]
*  So if you play with that math and it, so it was important for that game, but I also [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1263.88s)]
*  think it showed that the bills get it. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1268.88s)]
*  They get that we can't turn the ball over. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1271.56s)]
*  We can't give them extra possessions. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1273.64s)]
*  And in the fourth quarter, we are full, like full steam ahead. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1275.52s)]
*  Most important drive to save our season, even if we have a lead. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1279.28s)]
*  And I just think the way Josh is playing, I think this is this we're witnessing. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1283.24s)]
*  The best of Josh Allen in this moment and the best of one of the most talented [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1289.72s)]
*  players to ever play the position has got to be good enough eventually. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1294.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1299.08s)]
*  And this are there Manning Brady mid two thousands parallels for you with this [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1299.8000000000002s)]
*  when it seemed like Manning couldn't get over the hump against the pats and then [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1303.68s)]
*  finally was able to do in the AFC title game after how to regular season win. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1306.92s)]
*  But then he had to do it in the playoffs. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1311.16s)]
*  Then he finally did it. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1312.92s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1314.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1315.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1315.68s)]
*  I, I, like, it's impossible to say I'm confident or I have any confidence in it [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1317.0s)]
*  with my homes and we know what they do. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1321.3200000000002s)]
*  And, and like every good, good organization, they get their quarterback [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1323.6000000000001s)]
*  and they have drafted defense after defense, after defense. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1327.9199999999998s)]
*  And if you put a great defense on the field, which is what has been Brett [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1331.04s)]
*  Veach, their GM and Andy Reed, their philosophy, like the second they got my [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1334.56s)]
*  homes and realized he was the guy. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1338.56s)]
*  If you go back and study their drafts, it's like four of the first six picks [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1339.9599999999998s)]
*  defense, three of the first four, five of the first seven, six in a row defense. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1343.56s)]
*  And they've loaded up on that side because the quarterbacks going to take [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1349.04s)]
*  care of all the, all the problems on the offensive side. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1352.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1354.8s)]
*  So we've got to have a great defense because we don't have, we don't [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1355.8799999999999s)]
*  have a fixer on that side. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1358.2s)]
*  And so that's, that's how they built this whole thing. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1359.96s)]
*  And so, but I look at Buffalo and Buffalo, like defensively, they're not [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1363.04s)]
*  as, as great as, as Kansas city is, but they've done a lot of the same things. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1367.2s)]
*  They they've sacrificed their offensive playmakers for deep, for their defensive [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1372.2s)]
*  talent, I think they're better upfront in the defense than they maybe have [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1376.04s)]
*  been in previous matchups. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1379.32s)]
*  I just, I don't know. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1381.2s)]
*  I think it's their time. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1381.96s)]
*  So I was thinking about, I should have said this on the pod we did Sunday [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1383.56s)]
*  night after the game, I blew it. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1386.92s)]
*  They, there was 93 seconds left when they went for the two point. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1389.08s)]
*  And if Andrews catches it, it's 20, 27, 27, 27. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1393.24s)]
*  And we left the game and oh my God, he dropped it. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1396.52s)]
*  He blew the game for them. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1399.44s)]
*  Josh would add the ball with like enough time to go 40, 45 yards and [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1401.48s)]
*  set up some sort of field goal. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1405.96s)]
*  And I almost wonder if that would have been a better outcome for the bills. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1408.04s)]
*  As we think about the game going forward, like instead of how they want it, where [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1410.8799999999999s)]
*  the narrative after the game becomes, Oh my God, Baltimore Lamar, he didn't come [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1416.24s)]
*  through in the first half and Andrews fumble and drops the two. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1421.84s)]
*  And it was like Baltimore blew it. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1424.68s)]
*  Baltimore blew it. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1425.8s)]
*  Baltimore blew it. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1426.48s)]
*  If Alan had just come down and gotten the game winning field goal or whatever. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1427.84s)]
*  And those last 93 seconds, I feel like we'd be talking about this [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1431.4s)]
*  chiefs game differently. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1434.32s)]
*  And by the way, he probably would have. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1435.24s)]
*  Yeah, but I think Buffalo almost wants it that way. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1437.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1439.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1440.12s)]
*  They do seem like their chip on the shoulder. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1440.44s)]
*  They were doing a lot of nobody believed in us. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1442.72s)]
*  I think they knew what the line was. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1444.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1447.28s)]
*  I thought Baltimore was the best team in the league and I still kind of feel that [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1447.48s)]
*  way. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1450.72s)]
*  Like I don't regret picking them last week. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1451.16s)]
*  They lost, but, uh, I, I just thought they were really good and they, all the [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1453.48s)]
*  errors were self-inflicted. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1458.0800000000002s)]
*  The one, the punch out on the Andrews fumble was, that was a great play by [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1459.28s)]
*  Buffalo. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1463.16s)]
*  Yep. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1463.92s)]
*  There was two mistakes in the first half by Lamar were terrible plays by him. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1464.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1468.8s)]
*  Like really like plays you can't make. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1469.04s)]
*  He's good for those in these moments. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1471.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1473.3999999999999s)]
*  That's been the problem. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1473.84s)]
*  That's been the problem. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1475.0s)]
*  That has been the problem. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1476.04s)]
*  And for, for Alan, you know, it's fun when a quarterback gets to this point. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1477.32s)]
*  And we've seen it throughout the course of history where they kind of ha he kind [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1484.56s)]
*  of has to win this year. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1488.04s)]
*  He has to win this game. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1489.48s)]
*  Like this is like the season. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1490.6399999999999s)]
*  This is like, this is, this happens at basketball too. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1492.0s)]
*  You have a season where a lot of stuff align. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1494.76s)]
*  This is it. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1497.32s)]
*  I just really liked the chiefs. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1498.3200000000002s)]
*  I still think they're really good. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1499.72s)]
*  I don't feel like, but the team that they were in the first 12, 13 weeks, I think [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1500.96s)]
*  they've solved some of those issues. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1504.8000000000002s)]
*  They're a little more explosive than they were in September, October, November. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1506.76s)]
*  They can run the ball a little better. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1510.24s)]
*  I still believe in them at home. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1512.04s)]
*  I just think they're so hard to beat. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1513.3200000000002s)]
*  Kelsey is the whole deal. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1514.76s)]
*  Kelsey is the whole deal in this game. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1515.6000000000001s)]
*  If you go back and look, like he clearly has not been the player this year that [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1518.04s)]
*  he has been in the past, but you go back and look at those wins, the three times [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1522.96s)]
*  that the, um, the chiefs have beaten the bills, he's averaged nine catches per [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1527.72s)]
*  game, 96 yards and almost two, two touchdowns in those three games. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1533.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1537.4s)]
*  The week 11 game that we were talking to, I want to see it two catches for eight [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1539.44s)]
*  yards. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1543.3600000000001s)]
*  Well, they keep them in the garage during the regular season. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1544.1200000000001s)]
*  No, I get that. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1546.76s)]
*  I get that. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1547.64s)]
*  They put the cover over them. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1548.08s)]
*  They put the him in the heated garage with, especially this year when it was, is [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1549.28s)]
*  not, you know, I took a lot of heat for it, but I know I'm right. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1552.8s)]
*  Like he was not in the shape that he's been in, in a lot of other years. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1556.2s)]
*  It just wasn't like there. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1559.16s)]
*  So they were like, they were getting him to this point. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1560.5600000000002s)]
*  Had an awesome game with 117, right. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1562.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1565.3200000000002s)]
*  So Terrell Bernard did an amazing job in coverage on him. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1566.3600000000001s)]
*  So that's going to be the matchup you want to watch in this game. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1573.0s)]
*  The linebacker for the bills, the first time around. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1574.92s)]
*  He also had the interception in that game. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1576.72s)]
*  Um, but they have some secondary issues this game. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1579.0s)]
*  There's some guys who may, may not play and their secondary was already not [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1581.8000000000002s)]
*  incredible to begin with. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1585.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1587.04s)]
*  So, I mean that to me, because, because when my home's gets in these games and [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1587.44s)]
*  these types of situations, like it's cute that we've got a burner and Xavier [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1591.6000000000001s)]
*  worthy's here and we, you know, like all this, all these other bells and whistles [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1595.68s)]
*  and all the things we want, but he's going to rely on himself and Travis. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1599.48s)]
*  I mean, it's been proven. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1606.16s)]
*  And so he would rather, he would rather extend the play and dance around and do [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1607.64s)]
*  some things and wait for Kelsey to find a soft spot versus in those moments, in [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1611.44s)]
*  the big moments, if you really watch it, he'll turn down opportunities with other [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1617.64s)]
*  guys and say, I can create a little longer. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1621.48s)]
*  I'm going to wait for Travis because we have to, when he has to have it, that's [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1624.8s)]
*  what he tends to do. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1628.8s)]
*  So I think, I think Kelsey is going to be the key to this game and not, I don't [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1630.0800000000002s)]
*  stop breaking news, but like he, I think we kind of got lulled to sleep. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1634.64s)]
*  Well, they, you know, they're winning games and Travis hasn't been huge this [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1638.44s)]
*  year, but the. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1641.2s)]
*  No, they wanted three games from him. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1643.32s)]
*  That was it. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1644.88s)]
*  I think that was the deal before the season. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1645.52s)]
*  Are you going to be ready for the three games at the end of the season? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1647.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1649.8400000000001s)]
*  Are you going to be a nine for 99 with a touchdown each, each game? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1650.4s)]
*  All right. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1654.64s)]
*  My guy, Drake may, I know you've been watching them. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1655.48s)]
*  I just got a shoe horn just cause you're here. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1657.8400000000001s)]
*  I got a shoe in three shoe horn, three minutes of content. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1659.6000000000001s)]
*  So I'm on a lot of Pat's text threads and we watched what happened in Washington [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1662.04s)]
*  this year, where very similar to the paths right now, where they had, they drafted [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1665.84s)]
*  the franchise QB, they brought in a new coach, they brought in new leadership. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1671.8s)]
*  They made a bunch of smart free agent signings. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1676.0s)]
*  They did well in the draft and they just basically patched together a playoff [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1678.0s)]
*  team that now has a legitimate chance to make the super bowl and it'll happen in [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1681.72s)]
*  a year, the paths they have may. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1684.8s)]
*  So you think like, think of last year's may season as like Daniel's at LSEU [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1687.1599999999999s)]
*  basically like that kind of same thing. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1691.3999999999999s)]
*  Now he's going to have his first real season, hopefully with a, on a real [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1693.32s)]
*  professional team, easy schedule. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1696.4399999999998s)]
*  Uh, they have a ton of cap space. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1699.52s)]
*  The most in the league. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1702.0s)]
*  Um, I assume they're going to spend money. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1703.4399999999998s)]
*  The crafts really haven't spent money the last 10 years, but we'll [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1706.1999999999998s)]
*  see if they do it this year. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1708.76s)]
*  Fourth pick in the draft. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1710.8799999999999s)]
*  Top of every draft going, going down, they have two third round picks. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1712.9199999999998s)]
*  Like why can't this be them next year? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1716.3999999999999s)]
*  What are the reasons that can't happen? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1718.48s)]
*  I mean, what Jayden has done is, is unbelievably unique and special, but it's [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1719.92s)]
*  Drake's second year and he has shown he's like, he's different that last year's [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1724.8400000000001s)]
*  quarterback class, man, when you go back and look at it, I, I'm just excited to [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1730.6000000000001s)]
*  see it develop, but like Pennix look pretty good. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1734.64s)]
*  Bone X, bone X there's a cap on bone X, but he's definitely an, an [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1737.24s)]
*  average to above average starter. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1741.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1743.5600000000002s)]
*  And it's the perfect situation for him with Sean. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1743.8400000000001s)]
*  Um, but the whole group, you know, and now Ben Johnson comes to Chicago and, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1747.1599999999999s)]
*  and, you know, that's a whole different conversation. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1752.12s)]
*  They're set up for that kind of success. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1755.1999999999998s)]
*  I'm not saying make a Superbowl run, but they are set up to be a surprise. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1757.2399999999998s)]
*  Play maybe be a 10 win team to be a surprise playoff team next year from this, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1761.52s)]
*  you know, from the team that, that was a game away from having the first overall [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1766.1999999999998s)]
*  pick to make maybe potentially making a run. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1769.56s)]
*  They, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1773.08s)]
*  here's the hard part. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1777.1200000000001s)]
*  I just talked about the defense and variable certainly will, will have his [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1777.88s)]
*  finger on the pulse and make, make the final decisions, but he will be pushing. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1783.0s)]
*  Um, towards building a great defense with a great young quarterback. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1787.5600000000002s)]
*  I figure he'll do the lines, right? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1791.7600000000002s)]
*  He'll be like, let's start with the lines and we'll build out from [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1793.2s)]
*  both sides of the line of scrimmage. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1796.1200000000001s)]
*  And we'll pluck a receiver here. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1797.44s)]
*  We'll grab a retread running back there and we don't need to put a ton of [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1799.1200000000001s)]
*  money in that right away, unless they go out and get one of the, you know, the [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1803.1200000000001s)]
*  top free agents or make a trade a wide receiver. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1805.76s)]
*  I don't even know that that's going to be their MO, but we'll see. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1808.4s)]
*  But at the end of the day, like what we saw from Drake may was all you needed to [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1811.32s)]
*  see to have be resuscitated as a Patriots fan. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1816.0s)]
*  Like there's, they have two assets in the entire organization. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1819.6s)]
*  I said it, it's Drake may and Gonzalez at cornerback. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1823.72s)]
*  And variable now now we have three assets. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1827.4s)]
*  No, I'm saying before, before the move, before they changed over, like they had [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1829.28s)]
*  two, two assets and I was screaming, protect your assets. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1833.2s)]
*  Don't play them in that final game. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1836.8400000000001s)]
*  They shouldn't, you and I were texting. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1838.76s)]
*  They should never have had the coach coach that game. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1840.48s)]
*  Jared Mayo should never have been in that position, but here we are. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1843.2s)]
*  Now you've got the fourth pick and it's not all going to come down [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1846.8400000000001s)]
*  to the fourth overall pick. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1851.3600000000001s)]
*  You know, if Abdul Carter was the fall to women for it would be. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1852.48s)]
*  I don't want to say a miracle, but the odds are it's not going to happen. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1856.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1859.68s)]
*  They, they desperately, in my opinion, need one of the [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1860.32s)]
*  quarterbacks to fall to them. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1863.4s)]
*  Cam ward or. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1865.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1866.48s)]
*  So let's talk about that because right now it's a three player draft. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1866.6000000000001s)]
*  Unless Sanders can move up and get people excited and wet people's [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1870.48s)]
*  appetite and make it a foot. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1874.92s)]
*  Cause it seems like ward's higher than Sanders and then Carter and Hunter. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1876.16s)]
*  But right now it's a three player draft drop off. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1880.72s)]
*  People start arguing who the forced pick should be, which is bad for the pets. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1883.04s)]
*  I think. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1886.72s)]
*  Yes and no, because you're sitting there for Tennessee has a quarterback need. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1887.08s)]
*  Cleveland has a quarterback need and giants have a quarterback. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1890.52s)]
*  But Tennessee said they're taking the best guy. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1892.96s)]
*  They'd said like, no, who knows? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1895.12s)]
*  That might be posturing, but. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1896.76s)]
*  Bill, how long have you been in this game? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1898.72s)]
*  I'm not saying that they won't and maybe eventually they will, but. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1901.0s)]
*  But since when does the team come out with the, the, the, the, the [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1904.8799999999999s)]
*  mid January and said, if it's a generational talent, we're going to. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1908.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1913.6799999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1913.8799999999999s)]
*  That's fair. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1914.36s)]
*  We're going to say that's NFL speak for, Hey, come and get the pick. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1914.92s)]
*  If not, we'll, we'll take your guy. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1922.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1923.8000000000002s)]
*  They want out of that pick, you know, just like the Patriots would have [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1924.2s)]
*  wanted out of that pick because they realized they're the, there is no Drake [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1927.16s)]
*  may in this class, there's no Jay Daniels in this class. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1932.0800000000002s)]
*  There's no Caleb Williams in this class. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1934.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1936.48s)]
*  So, so let's try to get out of this pick and let's build it like the rest, like [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1937.7600000000002s)]
*  Detroit had built it, like the Eagles have built it like San Francisco did. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1942.08s)]
*  Like, you know, the Ravens continue to do all the organizations building [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1947.52s)]
*  on defense and offensive lines. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1951.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1953.44s)]
*  And so I think Tennessee is going to try to fall in that, in those footsteps and, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1954.3600000000001s)]
*  and try to follow the blueprint and try to get out of that pick and get more picks [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1959.0s)]
*  in a draft where, yeah, those are the top three and they're, they're elite players. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1963.4s)]
*  But even in recent drafts, you could say there's better at those individual [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1967.1200000000001s)]
*  positions. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1971.0s)]
*  So what's the, usually the quarterbacks drift up and they will set this weird [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1972.04s)]
*  phenomenon that happens. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1976.4s)]
*  And then all of a sudden you've got two guys in the top four, even though [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1977.84s)]
*  there's been like the Trubisky year was a good example of when that happened. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1981.72s)]
*  The more people stare at the list and the quarterbacks and think about how important [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1985.48s)]
*  the position is all of a sudden you start looking at the strengths instead of the [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1988.76s)]
*  weaknesses of the guys and the guys climb up. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1992.56s)]
*  So I assume that might happen. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1995.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1998.56s)]
*  I, one of two things is going to happen. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=1998.96s)]
*  Either both the quarterbacks are going to go to one of those three spots and [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2000.52s)]
*  Abdul Carter will go and then Travis Hunter is, is your, is your pick at number [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2004.32s)]
*  four, unless you can move out of that to get additional picks. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2009.76s)]
*  It doesn't seem like a variable pick. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2013.28s)]
*  It doesn't, right? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2015.28s)]
*  They need a left tackle. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2016.28s)]
*  They have to come out of the draft with the left tackle or pass rusher. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2017.4s)]
*  And that's it has to be for the paths. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2020.52s)]
*  It has to be one of those two. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2022.96s)]
*  They need people who can block for Drake May. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2024.0s)]
*  He's the only asset they have. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2025.92s)]
*  So trade back with Vegas at six or the Jets at seven, you know what I mean? [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2028.16s)]
*  Or, or, or the saints at nine and if one of those two quarterbacks falls, right? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2032.76s)]
*  Yep. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2040.1200000000001s)]
*  That would be the dream scenario. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2040.96s)]
*  I think the worst scenario is Cam and Chidor go in the top three picks and [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2042.28s)]
*  Abdul Carter has gone as well. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2048.76s)]
*  And now you're staring at Hunter who you don't need. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2050.92s)]
*  Who, who's a wonderful, he is a generational type. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2053.64s)]
*  Talent, but you're only getting them on one side of the ball for the vast majority. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2057.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2061.72s)]
*  And you have them as a cornerback, right? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2062.12s)]
*  I think he's actually a better wide receiver than he is cornerback. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2064.08s)]
*  But if you're going to try to play him and get value from him on both sides, you [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2068.6s)]
*  better play him as a cornerback and then put in some packages for him. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2072.16s)]
*  You know, that's going to be super fun. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2076.36s)]
*  If somebody decides to do that, I'm just glad that player exists. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2078.56s)]
*  Cause I remember, uh, you know, after college or even during college, when [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2082.32s)]
*  Dion Sanders, when I was in college and Dion had that capability of just coming [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2087.32s)]
*  in and playing series on offense, it was like the most exciting thing. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2091.8s)]
*  It's like, Oh my God, this is amazing. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2095.6000000000004s)]
*  I looked, I looked it up. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2097.92s)]
*  Like, was that many plays? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2099.0s)]
*  I think he had like 61 receptions his entire career. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2101.0400000000004s)]
*  Dion did. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2106.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2106.76s)]
*  Dion. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2107.0s)]
*  And that was the most like chant Bailey had like six Charles [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2107.44s)]
*  Woodson had like two, you know, like, so there's not a, there's not a history [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2112.84s)]
*  of, of someone actually being like consistently, you know, that productive. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2117.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2122.7200000000003s)]
*  So last year's draft seems like it was almost a unicorn draft, like the way [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2123.44s)]
*  we're going to look back at it, where there's just star players all throughout [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2129.52s)]
*  the first round, there's, uh, we ended up with five starting quarterbacks. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2133.6s)]
*  We ended up with potentially two, you know, maybe generational quarterbacks, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2137.88s)]
*  maybe three, if Caleb can get his shit going. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2142.72s)]
*  And then this year's draft, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2145.7999999999997s)]
*  we haven't seen anything from JJ yet. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2146.96s)]
*  Who's got arguably the best coach to develop them. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2148.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2151.08s)]
*  Um, and then this year's draft, like you look at cam ward, you look at Sanders. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2151.56s)]
*  Where did they go in last year's draft with the tape they have and like the [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2156.4s)]
*  grade they have for the season. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2160.12s)]
*  Are they in that like Penex, Nick's level? [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2161.7599999999998s)]
*  Are they JJ level or are they below Penex? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2164.56s)]
*  Like, where are they? [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2167.16s)]
*  I think, I think the conversation starts at four with, with JJ. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2168.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2173.52s)]
*  There's no conversation with, with Caleb, Jaden or, uh, or Drake. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2173.8399999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2179.4s)]
*  I think it starts at four. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2180.0s)]
*  Most teams had JJ McCarthy as the fourth. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2181.8399999999997s)]
*  Some teams were higher on him than others and believe that he was maybe the [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2184.68s)]
*  second or third best quarterback in the class. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2188.44s)]
*  I didn't, I didn't, I thought he was the fourth best. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2190.76s)]
*  Um, I think, see the interesting part is this, the best pure pastor in this [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2194.2400000000002s)]
*  draft is Shador layers, the ball, ball placement, good instincts as a passer [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2199.52s)]
*  processes things real quickly. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2204.16s)]
*  Doesn't have a great arm. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2206.28s)]
*  Not a very good. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2208.28s)]
*  The weird part is he's he's coach prime son. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2209.08s)]
*  He's not a great athlete. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2211.36s)]
*  Like he extends plays, but his instincts in the pocket, get him in a lot of trouble. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2213.0s)]
*  Um, and then you've got cam who doesn't, I don't want to say he doesn't process [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2218.28s)]
*  this as quickly, but he's been in these systems where he hasn't had to go through [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2222.56s)]
*  all the reads, um, I don't think he can get himself out of trouble as a rookie [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2225.48s)]
*  in terms of understanding where to go with the ball. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2230.44s)]
*  He's not as like consistent with his accuracy. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2232.96s)]
*  He makes more poor. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2235.64s)]
*  He'll make a player to a game where you're like, Oh no, like [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2236.96s)]
*  will love his type shit. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2239.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2240.84s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2241.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2242.16s)]
*  The Levis word. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2242.96s)]
*  But, but he's a better athlete than Chidor. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2244.8s)]
*  He extends plays his arm angles, the way he's able to get the ball out. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2248.52s)]
*  He's got a much better arm than Chidor. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2252.56s)]
*  So traits wise cam is the guy, if you can develop them. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2254.56s)]
*  But if you're asking compared to last year's class, I think it may go JJ, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2258.84s)]
*  JJ McCarthy for, and then, and then I would say cam ward, penics, and then [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2263.7200000000003s)]
*  Chidor kind of bone X like in that range. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2271.24s)]
*  So if Darnold had been really good down the stretch and let's say they lost in [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2274.92s)]
*  round two, but he was good in that game and it wasn't his fault. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2280.2799999999997s)]
*  And it turned into a situation. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2283.16s)]
*  Oh, Minnesota sure resigned him. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2285.3999999999996s)]
*  They like, they should actually bring him back and trade JJ. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2287.72s)]
*  That's a smarter move. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2290.08s)]
*  You think JJ has the kind of talent that you could have traded one of the four [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2291.64s)]
*  picks in the top four for JJ. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2296.12s)]
*  And that's a good trade compared to using the draft. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2299.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2301.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2301.96s)]
*  And I think it probably, it could have happened that way, but I don't know [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2303.04s)]
*  that Minnesota would have even gotten rid of them. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2306.6s)]
*  I think it would have sat on both. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2309.32s)]
*  Had he played great down the stretch. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2311.52s)]
*  It would, it was shaping. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2314.64s)]
*  I'm, I'm, I'm actually frustrated because it was shaping up to be one of the most [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2315.84s)]
*  fascinating personnel decisions you could ever make. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2319.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2322.2s)]
*  It was like, like a, like a poor man's young versus Montana type of situation. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2322.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2326.64s)]
*  It's like, what do we do? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2327.0s)]
*  We have two guys. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2327.84s)]
*  But the problem is with the salary cap, like you're now preventing your [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2328.84s)]
*  organization from building everywhere else by keeping Sam, but then are you [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2332.88s)]
*  going to gam, you have this sure thing. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2336.96s)]
*  If he goes and plays well, like you said, two playoff games, they lose, but he, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2338.96s)]
*  he's through for two 60, two 70 and everything. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2342.92s)]
*  27 years old or whatever it is. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2345.6s)]
*  It's like, all right, we got a guy. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2347.4s)]
*  We got our guy. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2348.7599999999998s)]
*  And so that, that would have been unbelievable to watch. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2350.2799999999997s)]
*  It's amazing what two games did to his value, you know? [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2352.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2356.04s)]
*  Now he's going to be like Giants, Tennessee, some sort of stopgap somewhere else. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2356.2s)]
*  But it'll be interesting to see how much money he lost too. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2362.32s)]
*  That was the most wrong I've been about anything all season. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2365.8s)]
*  I completely believed by week 17 with the Vikings. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2368.84s)]
*  I was like, I'm in on this team. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2372.48s)]
*  I believe in Darnold. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2373.84s)]
*  This team's going to beat Detroit. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2375.48s)]
*  I am in. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2377.04s)]
*  Why is everyone overlooking him? [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2377.6s)]
*  No one wants to talk about him. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2378.52s)]
*  I was the same way. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2379.68s)]
*  I was seeing him. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2380.84s)]
*  I saw that video of them carrying him, picking him up in the locker room. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2381.04s)]
*  After I was like, I'm all in. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2384.4s)]
*  I won me over. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2385.8399999999997s)]
*  And then he just turned into a pumpkin. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2387.08s)]
*  It was unbelievable. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2389.3999999999996s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2391.2799999999997s)]
*  So your mock draft has come in February 10th. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2392.72s)]
*  Your first one. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2397.16s)]
*  I think so. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2398.3599999999997s)]
*  That's what we're looking at. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2398.8799999999997s)]
*  Yep. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2399.8399999999997s)]
*  Not that far away. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2400.04s)]
*  No. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2401.3999999999996s)]
*  Is there, we could spoil one thing in the mock draft. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2401.68s)]
*  Is there a surprise guy for you that you're higher on than everybody else that you feel [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2405.3199999999997s)]
*  like you're going to be right and people just don't see it yet? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2410.8799999999997s)]
*  Do you have one of those guys? [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2413.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't want to bore you with a, with an offensive tackle, but Josh Connerly from Oregon. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2416.68s)]
*  Everyone's talked about this Will Campbell guy who's a guard tackle from LSU and Kelvin [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2423.9599999999996s)]
*  Banks, who's, who's a really talented player from, from Texas. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2428.52s)]
*  I think Josh Connerly might wind up being the best left tackle. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2433.2799999999997s)]
*  And for some reason, I haven't studied these guys copiously hoping the paths are going [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2436.56s)]
*  to take a left tackle. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2441.24s)]
*  Josh Connerly that high. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2443.2s)]
*  I think he's up there. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2445.04s)]
*  I think he, he, he's as he's unbelievably athletic the way he moves. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2446.36s)]
*  He's gotten better with his hands. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2452.6s)]
*  I think he's got a chance to be a star from this class and nobody, I haven't heard or [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2454.12s)]
*  talk to anyone who's, who's quite as high on him as, as I am. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2458.52s)]
*  So keep an eye on Connerly. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2462.2s)]
*  We'll have him in high. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2463.8s)]
*  Were you high on Cole strange a couple of years ago or no? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2464.96s)]
*  Not as high as the Patriots were. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2467.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2469.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2470.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2470.52s)]
*  Good. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2470.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2471.16s)]
*  We, we traded out of the, uh, McDuffie pick and then took him one pick in front of [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2471.6s)]
*  Carlathus was the rare double whammy, uh, Belichick down the stretch. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2476.92s)]
*  So you, so your dream scenario for the Pats would be somehow move out of that four [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2482.2000000000003s)]
*  pick, get into the nine to 11 range and take Connerly. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2486.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2491.76s)]
*  You think he goes that high? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2492.0s)]
*  Or I was, I think more like, I think he winds up going mid first, but, um, but [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2493.32s)]
*  if, if people see what I see, then, then maybe he goes, he goes somewhere around 10. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2501.24s)]
*  And the receiver classes, a disaster this year compared to last year, which [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2506.7999999999997s)]
*  was like a pretty historic run of dudes. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2510.96s)]
*  We've had, we had a historic, almost decade of run, run of, of wide receivers, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2514.3599999999997s)]
*  like every year, four and five first round, almost sure fire, like a lot of them, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2518.96s)]
*  you know, like all those Alabama guys, like, you know, when you look at them [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2524.96s)]
*  and then Ohio state guys and the LSU guys, like all from like five [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2529.68s)]
*  programs of the best majority. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2533.92s)]
*  It's not like Tedarola McMillan from Arizona is really talented, but, but I, I [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2536.52s)]
*  don't, you know, I wouldn't put him out. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2541.7999999999997s)]
*  He's not like Jamar chase, you know, I see him mocked at like four or five. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2543.2799999999997s)]
*  And I just, I have a hard time going that high on Luther burdens a burner, but [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2547.8399999999997s)]
*  drops a lot of passes inconsistent. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2553.2799999999997s)]
*  The best wide receiver in the class is Travis Hunter. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2556.16s)]
*  And after that, I think there's a lot of guys you like late in the first and second [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2559.0s)]
*  round, but I don't see the value where you're going to have to pick for him. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2562.92s)]
*  I just don't see last year was nuts. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2566.1200000000003s)]
*  Like even think like Bowers who is probably going to be the best tight end of [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2569.32s)]
*  his generation, if he doesn't get concussed 17 times, cause he tries to take on nine [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2574.28s)]
*  tackers every time he catches the ball. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2579.0800000000004s)]
*  But that guy, that guy's going to be the next guy. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2581.4s)]
*  It feels like, yeah, he is the next guy. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2584.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2587.0s)]
*  And how about lad McConkey? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2587.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2589.6400000000003s)]
*  I mean, that's Pat straight out of that pick. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2590.76s)]
*  That's, that's took the 10th, 10th wide receiver to not receiver draft. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2594.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2599.1600000000003s)]
*  Although don't you feel like, like I watched what Washington did where they, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2600.56s)]
*  basically they got this coaching staff and they overpaid for their assistance. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2604.6800000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2609.44s)]
*  They got overqualified dudes at different and they coach guys up. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2609.6800000000003s)]
*  Whereas the paths went the other way and had a terrible coaching staff, but [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2613.2400000000002s)]
*  aren't some of these guys out like, is poke really like, he's just not going to [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2616.76s)]
*  ever be an NFL player. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2620.6000000000004s)]
*  He's not salvageable at all. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2621.8s)]
*  Can you lose your confidence that degree? [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2623.0400000000004s)]
*  Cause he was, he was good last year. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2624.7200000000003s)]
*  Like nobody thought he was going to be a bus. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2626.84s)]
*  I just don't, I don't understand the concept of. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2629.2000000000003s)]
*  Can a coach and a coaching staff, like bring resuscitate a guy back to life. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2632.84s)]
*  Is that even possible? [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2637.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's possible. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2639.0400000000004s)]
*  It's possible, but there, but damage gets done as a rookie. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2640.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2643.6000000000004s)]
*  It really does. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2643.84s)]
*  And it's hard to overcome that. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2644.7599999999998s)]
*  Sometimes it takes to change the scenery and sometimes that's not even enough. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2646.3599999999997s)]
*  I just look at like what Adam Peters did at Washington would from the [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2650.12s)]
*  hire of Dan Quinn to the coordinators. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2653.24s)]
*  To Jayden was the easiest decision he had to make. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2656.24s)]
*  How about Mike Sanders, Sanders throw. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2659.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2661.56s)]
*  Two interceptions, Brett drafting him as a rookie. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2662.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2665.6s)]
*  What pit, what round was he? [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2665.72s)]
*  Um, he was, he wound up going second. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2667.48s)]
*  He was, uh, yeah, he wound up going second. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2671.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2673.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2674.7599999999998s)]
*  The Daniels one. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2674.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, obviously that was a huge topic with the Pats fans wondering what, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2675.8399999999997s)]
*  cause it seemed like there was a stretch there where it seemed like [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2680.3199999999997s)]
*  Washington might take Drake may. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2682.3199999999997s)]
*  And then it's like, okay, I'm going to talk myself into Daniels and he's a [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2683.96s)]
*  little older and he's maybe not durable, but holy shit. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2687.04s)]
*  And people in my life who love college football and like van [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2690.16s)]
*  Lathan who loves LSU was like, Daniels is incredible. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2693.4s)]
*  Like if you guys got Daniels, it'd be a miracle. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2696.4s)]
*  So you had that. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2698.8399999999997s)]
*  Um, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2700.2799999999997s)]
*  the conversations I had with a lot of NFL teams was like, I, you guys in [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2700.52s)]
*  the media are missing. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2705.2s)]
*  I remember in like about this time last year that you guys do. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2706.04s)]
*  You guys does. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2710.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2711.88s)]
*  You guys, me. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2712.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2713.16s)]
*  Like we're having real conversations and fights in our draft room. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2714.0s)]
*  Like when we go get together our meetings that we had a January meeting, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2718.88s)]
*  like it is a, it's a war in our room. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2722.8s)]
*  The Jaden versus Caleb wars. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2726.08s)]
*  And a lot of teams I talked to, you know, at the end before they saw the [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2729.3599999999997s)]
*  product on the field this year. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2732.8399999999997s)]
*  So it's not like, you know, revisionist history. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2733.8399999999997s)]
*  We're like, yeah, we would have taken Jaden. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2736.3999999999996s)]
*  So now if it's a redraft is Caleb third on everyone's board or is he [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2738.8799999999997s)]
*  second, third, you think I think he has to him. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2742.96s)]
*  I do. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2746.12s)]
*  Probably Daniels has to be first. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2747.08s)]
*  I mean, this is Daniels first, may second, then Caleb Daniels has won this [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2748.72s)]
*  argument at least for now. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2753.3999999999996s)]
*  Now he's in this different argument of like, who would you want with the ball [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2754.52s)]
*  with five minutes left in a playoff game? [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2757.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2759.3999999999996s)]
*  It's not my home. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2759.64s)]
*  Is he Daniels second, third or fourth? [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2760.64s)]
*  Is there a fifth quarterback in the NFL that you would take over Jaden? [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2763.08s)]
*  Like he's, I saw that conversation the other day. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2766.3199999999997s)]
*  Like, yeah, he's right. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2768.7999999999997s)]
*  He's had that burrow or J or J Danos, Herbert or J Danos. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2770.08s)]
*  Like, yeah, he's in, he's already graduated. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2774.08s)]
*  There is the second year thing, like shroud shroud grinding through it. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2775.8799999999997s)]
*  Didn't have as much protection, all that. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2779.96s)]
*  So they, they've got to avoid the second, second time around teams having a full [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2781.64s)]
*  off season to studies tendencies. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2786.96s)]
*  If he gets through his second year and is playing at this level, then we're, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2789.44s)]
*  we're in the clear, but, but I, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2793.04s)]
*  you don't worry about him physically at all over the course of 15 years, or is [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2794.88s)]
*  it like a Lamar? [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2798.68s)]
*  Of course I do. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2799.36s)]
*  Do me a favor at some point when you have a Freeman moment on your hands this week. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2800.2400000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2805.0s)]
*  I think I told Saru to you about this too. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2806.08s)]
*  You got to go on Twitter. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2808.08s)]
*  There's just like do a Jaden Daniels looney tunes. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2809.0s)]
*  Someone put together a great reel of him. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2813.92s)]
*  It's like all the times he just got popped. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2815.96s)]
*  And like, it's one thing to get popped, but when you're like the way his body [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2818.0s)]
*  parts are just flailing everywhere. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2822.04s)]
*  Cause he's so lean and long. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2825.08s)]
*  It's just, it's, it's hysterical. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2826.88s)]
*  It's worth a laugh. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2828.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2829.92s)]
*  Cause it concerns me. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2830.08s)]
*  We were always worried about Lamar, but Lamar always seemed like he knew how to [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2832.0s)]
*  take a hit, then some guys just know how to do it. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2836.04s)]
*  Jaden pops up so many times. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2839.36s)]
*  He's so flexible and that's just who he is, but he hasn't learned that yet. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2841.36s)]
*  Like he is not. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2846.08s)]
*  You know who was bad at that initially was Brady. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2846.92s)]
*  Brady took some smacks his first couple of years where he just got, and Drake [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2849.28s)]
*  May last year took like three or four horrible ones. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2854.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2857.76s)]
*  Brady figured it out. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2857.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2859.28s)]
*  That's the whole thing. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2860.0s)]
*  It's flexibility. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2860.6s)]
*  Like that's why, like the Brady quins and like the guys who are like T-Bows. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2861.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2867.04s)]
*  I just, I can't, Will Levis. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2867.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2869.56s)]
*  The dudes who look awesome with their shirt off and look like they can out bench [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2870.32s)]
*  Rossello or the ones I really worry about. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2875.0s)]
*  You know, but he can out bench Rossello. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2877.24s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2878.92s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2879.72s)]
*  Have you seen him lately? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2880.52s)]
*  He's fucking massive. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2881.48s)]
*  Just ask him. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2882.28s)]
*  Just ask him. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2882.84s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2883.48s)]
*  Do you think Brady screwed up everything for all of these old quarterbacks going [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2884.84s)]
*  forward where we decided this was realistic because Tom Brady did it. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2888.72s)]
*  And now we're just going to have this generation of guys in this Roger's cousin [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2892.2s)]
*  stage in their late thirties where they just suck. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2896.28s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2899.0s)]
*  No, no, Tom Brady did it. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2899.44s)]
*  I really feel like he fooled even me. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2900.72s)]
*  I picked the Rogers to, you know, win the AFC East this year. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2902.96s)]
*  I now it's like, oh yeah, it's really hard to play quarterback when you're 39 [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2906.84s)]
*  and your body's breaking down. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2910.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2913.04s)]
*  I went to that Patriots Jets game. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2913.64s)]
*  I brought my son. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2915.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2916.76s)]
*  To see him live in person now compared to what he was two years ago. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2918.04s)]
*  You know, like the MVP level version of Aaron Rodgers was, it was scary. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2924.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2930.28s)]
*  And to see Drake may before the concussion and how, how mobile and in [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2931.44s)]
*  control he was, it was like, oh, so that's, that's next. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2934.68s)]
*  And that's, that's my two takeaways. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2939.04s)]
*  Like that's next. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2941.7999999999997s)]
*  That's done. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2943.12s)]
*  And yet somebody will probably sign Rogers. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2944.64s)]
*  Some guessing there'll be one more year. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2946.68s)]
*  I feel like he's going to be like one of those boxers that needs to get knocked [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2949.92s)]
*  out two more times before they finally hang it up. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2952.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2955.2799999999997s)]
*  I could see him wanting to. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2955.6s)]
*  I just don't, why would you invest that and bring in that? [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2956.88s)]
*  I know. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2960.92s)]
*  I'm not saying I would. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2961.24s)]
*  I just feel like how many dumb teams do we have? [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2962.3199999999997s)]
*  We just watched the Jaguars do two weeks of coach interviews and then fire their GM. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2964.44s)]
*  This is like seven, eight, just horrifically managed franchises. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2969.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2975.2799999999997s)]
*  So yeah, I think Rogers could play somewhere. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2975.56s)]
*  Oh, I'm not saying he won't. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2978.04s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2979.08s)]
*  I'm just saying why would you with all the, with everything that comes with it too. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2980.12s)]
*  You know, I don't know. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2984.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2986.0s)]
*  That's the other piece. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWYb5-cBuqs&t=2986.24s)]
