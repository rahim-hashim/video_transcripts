# Will Brock Purdy Get Another Chance? #billsimmons #brockpurdy #podcast #shorts #nfl #49ers
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [February 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7YJeY_eGlw)
*  I was thinking about Brock Purdy and the line between being a hero and kind of being forgotten.
*  So Tom Brady, Super Bowl 36, and there's this huge play where he throws it out to JR Redmond,
*  who's coming out of the backfield. Redmond gets tackled. It seems like he's in bounds,
*  but they say he's out of bounds, stops the clock. Now all of a sudden, Brown over the middle,
*  Wiggins for a short one, Vinatier is coming out, field goal, Pats win the Super Bowl.
*  Like it happened that fast. Purdy yesterday, he's got the ball five plus minutes left.
*  If you can just keep the ball for five minutes and put up points, the Niners win the Super Bowl
*  and he's a hero. So what happens? Comes down, third down play, Chiefs make a great stop.
*  Not Purdy's fault. Mahomes scores, we go to overtime. What happens? Niners get the ball,
*  they're driving again. Big third down play, Chiefs make another big stop. Chris Jones and
*  Trent McDuffie are the two people that basically thwart Purdy. He doesn't have his JR Redmond moment.
*  He's not the hero and the Chiefs win the Super Bowl. Will he have the moment again? It's kind
*  of depressing. I'd be depressed if I was brought Purdy today. You might not get back. That might have been it.
