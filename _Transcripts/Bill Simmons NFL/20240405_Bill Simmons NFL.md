# Bill Simmonsâ€™s WR Pyramid | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [April 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuQU2tSna0Q)
*  I sent you my wide receiver mini pyramid and the exercise was where's digs on this.
*  Right.
*  So I had Jefferson, if we're going to go top level is one, one player, second
*  level is two players, third level is three players and on it's supposed to
*  look like a pyramid.
*  I had Justin Jefferson as my number one receiver.
*  I had him at the top of the pyramid.
*  Some people, I floated this to a bunch of different people and some people
*  were like, why not Tyreek?
*  And I do think Tyreek is the most impactful receiver we have, but he had a
*  couple of weird games last year where like he was hurt, then he'd come back,
*  then he'd go out again, then he'd come back and it's like, I just don't know
*  what I'm getting from that guy sometimes.
*  Whereas Jefferson, I just think like if he's on the field and he has a decent
*  QB, he's putting up giant numbers.
*  Who would you have put first?
*  Jefferson.
*  It's the injury thing with Tyreek and yeah, like Tyreek is probably the
*  scariest weapon in the league.
*  Yeah.
*  But if you're just saying like fantasy draft, like I could have one receiver
*  to like pair with my young quarterback or whatever quarterback I have to make him
*  better, Jefferson just does everything.
*  And he was a little dinged up this year, so maybe that takes some shot off of him.
*  But I, I just think Jefferson's like the prototype of what you're looking for,
*  the position, whereas Tyreek is more of a, you know, a generational like, oh my
*  God, like, what do I do with this guy?
*  And you know, you have to fit him into whatever you're doing.
*  And obviously the two teams that he's been on have done that.
*  But Jeff, to me, Jefferson, I'm taking him one and Tyreek's definitely too.
*  He's Jefferson's also way younger Tyreek.
*  It's like, how many more years at this level are we going to get from him?
*  I have Tyreek as two.
*  So the second level, Jefferson top level Tyreek and CD lamb.
*  I think it's those three guys in some order as the top three CD lamb to me is
*  like the guaranteed number three.
*  You're good with that, right?
*  I am.
*  I try to talk myself into, I love Jamar chase and it was a weird season just
*  because, you know, the quarter burrows out and he still put up decent numbers
*  with, you know, with Browning, but lamb had such a stupid season.
*  Lamb had such a stupid season.
*  Like he had the numbers he put up and he was just always wide open for the
*  Cowboys that I think it surprised me a little bit.
*  Like I always thought he was really good, but he was genuinely an elite top,
*  you know, third here.
*  So I don't have an issue with that.
*  I think different seasons you can say, yeah, maybe Jamar chase comes back next
*  year and is better, but I have no issue with lamb at three.
*  Third level chase number four St.
*  Brown.
*  And then I put Devante Adams as the, as the third guy.
*  So the sixth guy overall on this third level, because even though I didn't love
*  the year he had last year, I think his quarterback situation the last couple
*  of years has been abysmal and I still wonder like what, just give that guy like
*  a decent quarterback, what kind of stats could put up?
*  So I just, to me it's chase St.
*  Brown and Devante Adams four or five, six here.
*  Yeah.
*  I St.
*  Brown is again, like over the middle, all the stuff that he does for golf.
*  He's just like the perfect safety blanket for a guy for a quarterback.
*  I, you have AJ Brown and the next tier just down.
*  I actually, I would put AJ Brown in this tier.
*  I know he like, so you didn't put him over Adams.
*  I thought about it.
*  I switched it back and forth.
*  Would you put them over Adams or St.
*  Brown?
*  I think he and St.
*  Brown are like the same guy.
*  I think they're both awesome.
*  So like, I don't know that I'd want to rank one above, like yes, St.
*  Brown had a better year last year.
*  Team did better.
*  Spotlight was a bit more, but like an AJ Brown saw a good year last year, but not
*  his greatest year and so maybe that's your doc and I'm a little bit there, but I
*  just, I just think those guys are so close and I have to put them right next to
*  each other.
*  If I have to knock one guy down, it's a pyramid.
*  I can't put four guys on level three.
*  I can look for three.
*  You're asking me to put Devontae Adams.
*  I think I would.
*  So I put AJ Brown seventh as the first guy in the fourth level, just because of
*  some of the, some of the whispers about the chemistry on that team last year.
*  And I just, something unseemly about whether he wanted the ball at the time or
*  there was some diva stuff with him that I didn't know how to process.
*  So that was it.
*  I think talent wise is in the top five.
*  You could tell me we can flip them.
*  Anyway, he's the first guy in this Mike Evans.
*  I have Puka.
*  We can argue about that in a second.
*  Garrett Wilson and I, you, so no Debo on this, uh, on this fourth level.
*  Puka is probably the one cause he's only done it for one year, but I think, you
*  know, first of all, he was incredible in the playoff game, which really matters to
*  me, but also like his blockings, unbelievable.
*  I mean, he's probably the best blocker of all of these dudes, except maybe Debo.
*  And, uh, I dunno that that pushed over the top.
*  Garrett Wilson, we've never seen with a good quarterback.
*  And I feel like he's going to be awesome.
*  At some point you're shaking your head.
*  No, I love him.
*  And it's, it's funny.
*  When you put this ranking together, it's like, you have to kind of.
*  Drain on a curve guys who have like really good quarterback play versus
*  guys who play with duds and he's had zero help throughout his entire career.
*  And he's, and I still watch Jets games and he just, he just stands out of the tape.
*  The guy's just an insane athlete catches everything and just does the
*  most with the absolute least.
*  Like next year of Rogers is healthy.
*  Like I think there's a chance that Garrett Wilson could be closer to five than he is
*  10, like I think he's that talented and that good, obviously you can't put him there.
*  Now.
*  Um, I mean, there's a couple of guys lower on the list that we'll get to in a second,
*  but some of the guys that just don't have quarterback play, it's hard to
*  judge them because their stats aren't going to be the same, but if you put them
*  on a chief team, a Rams team, a lions team, I think they'd probably put up the
*  same or maybe better stats than some of the guys we have here.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a Larry Fitzgerald corollary.
*  That, that, like that five years when Larry Fitzgerald just had no
*  quarterbacks at all and we just felt bad for him every year, but you, you knew
*  he was still awesome, but the stats didn't reflect it.
*  Kevin Cobb.
*  Yeah.
*  You could have talked me into Garrett Wilson in the six spot instead of
*  Devante Adams, cause I think he's that talented, but the fact that he's never
*  done it, I think he had to get docked on that.
*  So then the other big con the big controversial one for me, just trying to
*  figure this out was putting IU go over Debo.
*  Cause I think most people feel like Debo is a better player, but for me, there's
*  a durability piece with Debo only mainly not his fault.
*  Cause the way the Niners use him, he just gets crushed like five times a season.
*  But I really value IU like when his name was getting floated around as a possible
*  trade guy and maybe they can't afford them and maybe they're going to do to him
*  what they did with, with Buckner that when they traded Buckner and they drafted
*  his replacement, basically, maybe they'll do that with IU.
*  I immediately was like, wow, the Patriots could get IU for like their high second
*  round pick.
*  I would do that in five seconds.
*  Cause I think that guy's awesome.
*  Debo, I wonder like, is, is there a market smart piece to him where his, the way
*  his style of play, his body's going to start breaking down over the next couple
*  of years, I'd rather have IU.
*  Yeah.
*  Could you, I mean, I'm sure there's some sort of cap that you'd have to take on
*  this, but like if you're saying I could have one guy going forward, I mean, I
*  use cause the better receiver, he just, he just, that's just the way it is.
*  And Debo, the way that his body is like, can you, can you kind of maybe sucker
*  somebody into trading for him?
*  I still like Debo.
*  I, I want him on my team.
*  But you know, he's one of those kids.
*  It's like the heat.
*  It's like, it's like Jimmy Butler, like just get me to the playoffs and like,
*  you know, hopefully you're healthy and you're fine.
*  Like I don't really care about the record season with Debo at all anymore.
*  So if that's what you're doing, that's fine.
*  I, you guys like a surprising guy because I don't, he's not flashy, but he just,
*  he runs great routes and he's always kind of open.
*  And he's always open like twice a game where you're like, man, he got to open
*  again. How'd he do it?
*  But, but do you ever worry about like, this is where I get into the scheme
*  stuff again, where you go, all right.
*  Yeah.
*  He plays for the Shanahan offense though.
*  And like, you know, if you put them on the Panthers, like how awesome, you
*  know, and then he's got Bryce young throw into him, like is it, do we still have
*  him, you know, in the fourth tier here?
*  I don't know.
*  I think he's, I don't think he's like incredibly talented.
*  I just think he's a really, really solid receiver.
*  Well, that's why I wonder if they have a receiver they love either at the end of
*  the first round or beginning of the second round, would they say, yeah, instead
*  of paying IUK, we can get a speed guy here that we really like.
*  And we go anyway, so that's the fourth group.
*  So now we're at, we're through 11 receivers.
*  Six.
*  Yeah.
*  11.
*  So this last group is six, which will bring us to 17 total Debo.
*  Cup.
*  I didn't have initially, and then a couple of the, I sent this to the
*  Ringer draft show guys and they were like, Cubs got to be on.
*  I was like, well, cup, are we getting cup ever again?
*  It's like, wow, he's hurt last year.
*  I just don't, are we getting him again?
*  So I'm just on reputation alone.
*  I'm probably not there.
*  And does it make you feel weird?
*  All the puka just came in rookie year and basically did exactly what
*  Cooper cup did for three, four years.
*  Yeah.
*  Again, I don't want to take it because the scheme, the scheme is, you know,
*  yeah, again, I don't want to take it because the scheme thing is hard.
*  Like McFay is an incredible guy and like, I'm not taking anything away from puka
*  either, but like that's clearly a role to find out for those guys and they're very
*  good, but I don't know if that takes any shine off of Cooper club, plus the health
*  and the age thing, I don't know.
*  I think, I think it's fine to have them there.
*  I wouldn't, I wouldn't cry if he wasn't on the, in the tier list though.
*  Nico Collins, I had to put on cause I think that guy's just a stud and out of
*  anybody on this last level, I think he's the guy with a chance to jump maybe two
*  levels by the time the end of next season happens.
*  Devonta Smith, who is one of those guys, you just don't understand why he's not
*  one of the five best receivers in the leagues with some of the catches he makes
*  weird team, weird situation.
*  Not, not he's one of those rare ones where it's like, I'd actually rather see
*  him on a bad team, just having the ball thrown to him all the time.
*  You're nodding.
*  I, I kind of disagree.
*  Oh, okay.
*  I think he, and like Jaylen wattle, like I think I'd probably have Jaylen wattle
*  in similar ballpark that I would Devonta.
*  Like I think, I think what you get into this last year, you know, so you've, you
*  haven't named the entire thing.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Let me, a lot of these.
*  Yeah, go ahead.
*  Go ahead.
*  Yeah.
*  So I had Debo cup, Nico Collins.
*  I feel good about all those three Devonta Smith, DJ Moore, and last but not least
*  Stefan Diggs, which was the whole point of this exercise.
*  So he squeaked in in the last spot and I, and I was switching them out, putting
*  him back in, switching them out.
*  I ended up keeping them 17th, but I, from, from a salary cap standpoint, there, there's
*  nine other guys I'd rather have.
*  But if you're just talking about pure talent, throwing salaries aside, I think he's
*  probably still there, but I also think this is probably the last year he's there.
*  Probably.
*  So then you don't have, you don't have Kenan Allen in this.
*  Uh, as I mentioned, you don't have wattle.
*  Higgins is out.
*  Uh, who else would be looking at?
*  Well, the Amari Cooper and tanked out were the toughest cuts for me because tanked out
*  got hurt.
*  And I feel like if you didn't get hurt, I don't know what happens to him in a good
*  way down the stretch.
*  Collins ended up getting a lot of the shine cause though was out, but I thought
*  Dell was awesome.
*  And then DJ Moore, DJ Moore, you can talk me into, he's like the bad quarterback
*  all-star and he still puts up these stupid stats.
*  And you know, last year you're watching it, you know, I think he was like 16 yards
*  or something like that.
*  And then, you know, playing with, uh, you know, Justin Fields, who was inconsistent
*  at best, I, you can actually talk me into him being higher on this list.
*  I got, I don't know.
*  Like he's not one of those guys that jumps off the screen at you either, but I'm
*  just like, he's all, if he's always put being productive with these terrible
*  quarterback situations, doesn't that tell you everything you need to know about
*  how good this guy is as a wide receiver?
*  It's, it's kind of like Kenan Allen, but with bad quarterback play.
*  So it sounds like we like 15 for sure.
*  And then Devante and digs are kind of at the tail end of this list and you could
*  bet then it becomes preference.
*  If you're talking about who I think is going to bump some of these guys during
*  the 24 season, I would definitely bet on Zay Flowers.
*  I would definitely bet on Addison on the Vikings and a bet on, uh, on Dell
*  and Houston would be my three candidates.
*  The problem with Addison is like, who's their quarterback?
*  He might just be a victim.
*  Are you kidding?
*  It's going to be the next Tom Brady, JJ McCarthy.
*  When they trade, when they trade them to the Chargers, they're going to trade 11
*  and 23 and her first to move up six spots.
*  That's my prediction.
*  And Higgins is another interesting one.
*  Like if he ends up on, I don't know, the paths, Panther, whatever team wants to
*  trade for him and he's going to play, he's playing with a bad quarterback or a
*  rookie quarterback, do we, are we as excited about him as we were with Joe
*  Burrow?
*  I, I, I like him, but I don't know.
*  I'd like T Higgins, but he's one of those guys when you actually look at his
*  stats, it doesn't kind of match what's in your head.
*  With either fantasy or real life.
*  Like he's never had 1100 yards in a season.
*  He's never had more than seven touchdowns in a season.
*  It's he's good, but I'm also like, you know, you have chase on the other side.
*  Like you should have good stats.
*  You have Burrow as your quarterback for most of that time.
*  So I'd be interested to see, well, and what happens that like he goes to the
*  Patriots and now he's the number one, the defense is moving toward him and
*  Jacoby Bercetta is his quarterback.
*  What kind of stats are he putting up?
*  The interesting thing about the mini pyramid here, we have Marvin Harrison.
*  We have Tyree kill 2.0 coming out of LSU and we have a Thomas also coming out of
*  LSU and all three of those guys.
*  Um, I think are better assets than some of the guys we've mentioned.
*  I don't know if any of them are ready to vault into the mini pyramid right away.
*  Do you think if you had to bet on one, who would you bet on?
*  Well, the disrespect to Roma Dunze, who I think is my favorite receiver in this
*  draft, everybody likes neighbors.
*  Yeah, no.
*  Well, everybody likes neighbors because he's just, you know, he's a track star
*  and he's like, you know, Tyree kill light, essentially Harrison.
*  He's going to walk in to, you know, from day one being a top, probably
*  definitely 20, 15 receiver.
*  The question with him is just like the ceiling, you know, is he, is he going to
*  be, is he ever going to be Jefferson or lamb or chase, or is he just going to be
*  like, you know, I don't know, Mike, Mike Evans, for example, which is fine.
*  Like Mike Evans is great.
*  He's obviously in your tier list.
*  He's really good, but he's not, I don't know.
*  He's not the flashiest player and I don't think he'd ever put him in like the top
*  five receivers.
*  So that's the question, but I do, I love Rome.
*  Rome is six, three.
*  He's built like a tank.
*  He, you know, his route running could work on a little bit, but he's great with
*  the ball after the catch.
*  I think that guy at Washington, you know, the wash, the weapons at Washington, you
*  could argue are better than some of the NFL teams.
*  I mean, probably better than your past last year.
*  So that's one of the Michael Pettis.
*  That's one of the knocks against Michael Pettis is like, did he actually have
*  where the weapons kind of the deal?
*  I don't know that it's necessarily true, but I would say, you know, Harris is
*  going to be a great player.
*  You know, neighbors depends on the team, but I like him and I think Rome, wherever
*  he goes, I think he's being mocked to the giants at a lot of places.
*  He would step in from day one and be obviously their number one receiver.
*  It's just like, who's throwing the ball?
*  Again, the question we've been asking so far.
