# Can Someone Other Than a QB Win the MVP? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [November 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5bDbxNVVw)
*  Danny, we haven't had a non QB win since famously Adrian Peterson in 12 and then
*  Tomlinson won in 06 and Alexander wrote he won it in 05, which I had a problem
*  with at the time.
*  Um, but somehow over the last 10 years we've decided only quarterbacks can win
*  this award.
*  Why?
*  How did this happen?
*  Uh, for obvious reasons, cause they're by far the most important player on the
*  field, I guess.
*  Um, and it's funny because now we're talking about Jalen hurts and my
*  argument for Hertz is not even necessarily that he's the best quarterback or the
*  best passer, the best pure passer anyway.
*  It's like what he does is like runner is incredibly valuable.
*  Um, and so, you know, I guess like my pushback to Steven would be like, well,
*  what he does as a runner is really valuable, but then you can start talking
*  about like, maybe it's actually Chris McCaffrey is the MVP in the league.
*  If we're really talking about running value.
*  Um, but, but looking at some of the numbers for Jalen hurts right now, he has
*  the most total EPA is a rusher in the NFL.
*  And that includes all running backs.
*  Um, he's third in EPA per rush.
*  53% success rate is first among all ball carriers.
*  Uh, first down rate first, uh, he has nine rushing touchdowns, which is the same
*  as Christian McCaffrey and he also passes the football.
*  So that would be, I think the argument, even though I don't know if I necessarily
*  believe that makes him the most valuable player, you know what I mean?
*  So I think that would be sort of the pushback you'd have.
*  I have one more piece to the argument.
*  The tush push is the most unstoppable play in football this year.
*  And you know, they, they talk openly about, we feel like it's first down
*  to nine, not first down and 10 for us.
*  It is the biggest weapon.
*  I think that any quarterback has my home shouldn't win because
*  his receivers aren't good enough.
*  Lamar has been up and down.
*  I guess my question is I personally vote for Tyree kill.
*  I think he was the most impactful player this year.
*  I think I I'm still not the two of fans get furious every time I say this, but
*  I'm still not sure how good two is.
*  Um, and Tyree solved so many problems for whoever your quarterback is.
*  I just think he's been the most impactful, scariest, most dominant
*  offensive player and really player on either end.
*  Um, why can't Tyree kill win this Ruiz?
*  I, I don't know.
*  I think he's the key to that offense.
*  He's the reason the offense is able to function the way that it does.
*  They do stuff with like motion that no other team is capable of doing.
*  Like when they motion him and have him run a dig route 15 yards down field,
*  like that's not viable for any other team, except for the team that has Tyree kill.
*  And I'm not exaggerated when I say that their offense is built around like four
*  plays and how they do stuff, those plays and all those plays are built around him
*  and waddle and their speed.
*  I, every time I watch the dolphins play, I like, there are times when I'm like,
*  am I wrong about two of like, am I hating on him?
*  Am I not giving them enough credit?
*  And then I watch him play and I'm like, no, I'm not.
*  Like if anything, I'm overrating him by having him where I have.
*  Like I'm at the point where I'm almost willing to put Brock Purdy over to, uh,
*  in the MVP discussion.
*  I think he does more for that offense for that 49ers offense outside of the stars
*  on the team than Tua does for his offense.
*  I think he makes all the same throw, like all the same anticipatory throws over the
*  middle. He's doing all that stuff.
*  What does Tua do that Brock Purdy doesn't do?
*  Brock Purdy scrambles at least.
*  Well, it seems like a big part of Miami's offense is just to have Tua get the
*  rid of the ball as fast as possible.
*  So he doesn't get hit, you know, that we have enough cool advanced stats now.
*  They're like first and hits allowed on their quarterback, right?
*  He gets hit less than any other quarterback in the league.
*  Um, their sack rate is way down partly cause he gets rid of it fast, but you can
*  also do that when you have Ty Rico on your team.
*  If he was playing with Marquise Valdez, Scanling, Juju Smith, Schuster, and, uh,
*  I'm trying to think of, uh, oh, Devante Parker.
*  You're not getting rid of the ball in two seconds, but with Ty Rico, they have
*  to ease it motion.
*  They're using them all these different ways.
*  The defenses are terrified of him.
*  And I think to me, that's a big part of the MVP candidacy for Tyreek.
*  It's like, who is the other team the most scared of heading into a week?
*  Lombardi has been on this for years about how he felt like Tyreek was, you know,
*  that he called him the field tilter.
*  And I remember last year, I was talking about how him with Steph Curry, where
*  Steph Curry can have 22 points in a game, but still dramatically affect the game
*  because all his motion in the game is just affecting the, and opening doors
*  for other, other guys.
*  I do feel Danny, I feel like Tyreek does that not only for Tuah, but for Miami.
*  It's because of his speed that they're good.
*  Absolutely.
*  He's the, the word I use.
*  I like the field tilting thing, even though that's a little bit like hard to picture.
*  I do think, uh, he's a force multiplier.
*  And that's a variable that you can come in and like affects everything else.
*  It like, it multiplies everyone else on the field.
*  It like the defense has to tilt to Tyreek because he has so much speed.
*  He has so much, uh, you know, he can score from anywhere anytime he touches the football.
*  So you have to account for that.
*  That opens up a room for the run game.
*  It opens up room for, um, you know, the other receivers and gives them an
*  opportunity to have more space and get rid of the ball quicker.
*  And like, so that there's like a snowball effect with what he can do.
*  I think in the secondary, um, there's more, I just like, like
*  to picture Tyree kill.
*  There's more plays where it's like, you know, how they do a still image.
*  It's like Tyree kill scored on this play.
*  He's like got six guys all around.
*  You know, it's like, how the hell did he get through the defense?
*  He's just like so much faster than everybody else on the field, which is of course,
*  like it's a field full of the elite athletes in the world, you know?
*  And so, um, I would probably lead Tyree to if it's definitely, definitely if it's
*  not going to be a quarterback, I would lead Tyree.
*  But isn't that the same argument you're essentially making for Jalen
*  Hertz is like the value he presents to the Eagles is like the space thing.
*  Like you have to account for this.
*  And I think Tyree Hill does it in a more unique way.
*  And like an example, before Josh stopped got traded from the Cardinals, the
*  Cardinals were like 10th in the offensive EPA on in run game because they ran
*  zone read and they did RPO like Jalen Hertz does help the Eagles offense, but
*  it's not in a way where any other option quarter, let me say the run game, not
*  the pass game, it's not in a way that any other mobile quarterback wouldn't help
*  the run game, like not only were the Cardinals really good at running the ball,
*  like just zone read and doing all that stuff that the Eagles do, by the way,
*  they have the same coachings, they have like a similar coaching staff.
*  So there's a lot of overlap in the offense, but they were also really,
*  really, really good at the tush push.
*  They were one of the teams that were doing the tush push.
*  They were doing it even better than the Eagles at one point in the season.
*  I haven't checked the stats since then.
*  I wrote an article about the tush push like a month ago, but at that point they
*  had a perfect success rate, they were averaging more yards, no EPA, better
*  success rate than Philadelphia.
*  So I don't think it's like a Jaylen Hertz thing.
*  I think there's some, there's more to it than just the quarterback being able to
*  squat 600 pounds or whatever it is.
*  Interesting.
*  Yeah.
*  I think with, uh, I mean, even you look at like how they value the MVP odds.
*  Where Tuah is five to one and Tyreek is 60 to one.
*  And I want to find the one person in America who thinks Tuah is more valuable
*  to Miami than Tyreek.
*  Like that's just insane.
*  You know?
*  And so if you're making the case for Jaylen, you know, it's what you just laid
*  out as like, oh, he does this, he does this, he does this.
*  The counter to all that is I'm not sure he's played that well this year for him,
*  for what his ceiling is.
*  It's weird to think somebody could win the MVP, but it's like a B plus season for
*  them and so I wouldn't even say it's an A minus season.
*  I think he's missed throws.
*  He was terrible in that Jets game.
*  I thought in the Chiefs game yesterday, I thought he missed open guys and in
*  general, he didn't seem 100% healthy to me.
