# NFL Guess the Lines Week 12 With Cousin Sal  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [November 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70CnEhBvOZ0)
*  All right, guess the line, Sal.
*  What's our record for the year?
*  What do we got?
*  I won last week, so it's, you're up six, four, one
*  through 11 weeks.
*  So you're like a plus 107 underdog, could JJ bet you?
*  JJ's all over it.
*  And then Raheem, who's also on the show,
*  who's been doing well lately and just can't resist
*  telling everybody about how well he's doing.
*  He's in the dugout being like,
*  hey, we're throwing a no hitter through five innings.
*  No hits by the other team.
*  I love it.
*  We just brag.
*  We had a bunch of characters.
*  Then Joe House.
*  Joe House, you know, that pregame show is an hour and a half
*  and he holds the microphone for an hour.
*  Right.
*  It's a heavy ass, but it's not, you know, this is not,
*  you're not hosting, holding like a calendar here.
*  It's a pretty hefty microphone.
*  He has to get right in there.
*  So Raheem is a confidence player.
*  Yeah, House did million dollar picks with me
*  after the Washington game on Thursday night.
*  And he's like, I might have a few drinks.
*  I'm like, great, people love drunk house.
*  He was actually pretty subdued.
*  And as we're doing it, I'm like,
*  this actually might be drunk house
*  because he's not loud and like fun drunk house.
*  He actually seems like he's had a few.
*  So then today he's like, yeah, the Browns.
*  I was probably a little drunk on Thursday night.
*  I probably should have suggested that one
*  because he gave me the Browns.
*  You're blaming him, but you're betting a million dollars
*  on these picks.
*  They really are.
*  They really should come from you.
*  I don't know why you're so trusting.
*  I know.
*  Thursday night, Steelers, speaking of the Browns,
*  Steelers in Cleveland.
*  It's really rough for the Browns.
*  Maybe we should have seen it coming
*  when they traded one of their pass rushers
*  right before the trade deadline.
*  And then they traded a Mark Cooper, their best receiver.
*  That should have been a red flag.
*  Steelers at Cleveland on a Thursday night.
*  And to me, this has to be Steelers by three and a half.
*  Really?
*  You're still gonna get it.
*  I said six and a half.
*  It's four and a half.
*  Why is that even that low?
*  Eight and two against two and eight.
*  I just think the Thursday night,
*  you got a docket for the road game, road team
*  coming off an emotional, physical.
*  I mean, that Baltimore Pittsburgh game,
*  we didn't talk about how physical
*  how much shit talking there was in that game.
*  That game was awesome.
*  These games are awesome today.
*  Pittsburgh Baltimore, the Buffalo game was great.
*  This Chargers game was great.
*  And this Steelers Browns game would not be great.
*  Yeah.
*  Sunday Marquee game.
*  I think it's Packers Niners, right?
*  Yeah, I think so.
*  It's in Green Bay.
*  There's some interesting ones, but that's it.
*  I had a lot of trouble with this one
*  because the Niners seem like they're getting a lot of respect
*  based on past performance,
*  potential of what the performance is.
*  And I really think this line should be
*  at least Packers by one and a half.
*  So I'm gonna do that.
*  Packers by one and a half.
*  Well, you said at least, you wanna go a little higher?
*  You can go a little higher if you want, motherfucker.
*  I said two, it's one and a half.
*  You think that flips?
*  Is that Niners minus one and a half?
*  George Kittle's back.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Oh, they love flipping the one and a half.
*  Healthy.
*  The one and a half is so dangerous.
*  It'd be the flip.
*  And now we're gonna add six and make a nice teaser
*  and it's not gonna make any sense.
*  Did you see there was a thing going around today about,
*  and I don't know if it accounts for today's games or not.
*  Somebody sent this to me.
*  Active NFL coach records in one score games.
*  And the worst coach is Eber Fluss at five and 17
*  in one score games.
*  Zach Taylor's 21 and 32.
*  Peterson's 32 and 43 and Kyle Shanahan's 29 and 33
*  in one score games.
*  Kinda feels that way, right?
*  Yeah, Shanahan feels that way
*  because I think we examined this stat a year ago
*  with Shanahan.
*  You're telling me Zach Taylor's won 21 one score games?
*  Yeah, where were they?
*  No, no.
*  College?
*  What is it, junior college?
*  Tomlin's 107 and 68 in one score games.
*  He's the man.
*  Adds up.
*  Yep.
*  LeFleur's 33 and 21.
*  And then your guy McCarthy's 73 and 65.
*  But he had Rodgers before Rodgers was washed.
*  That's not fair.
*  That's not fair.
*  But yeah, the Eber Fluss thing jumped out to me
*  and then Shanahan 29 and 33 with all the talent they've had.
*  Thought that was notable.
*  Yeah, you think when you go for an extension,
*  they show you that tweet or whatever you saw?
*  It's not good.
*  You know what else isn't good, Sal?
*  I only have two watchable games after the marquee game.
*  And one of them is the Lions
*  just because I think Lions Colts will be fun
*  because I really enjoy watching Richardson.
*  You just don't know what's gonna happen on Richardson.
*  Every pass is exciting.
*  He might sail it over somebody's head.
*  He might bounce it.
*  It might be one of the best 20 yard in passes you've seen.
*  Just don't know.
*  I have the Lions favored by six and a half in Indianapolis.
*  All right, finally I get this.
*  I had seven and it's seven and a half.
*  They're just crushing teams though.
*  They have to put it north of seven.
*  This can't go lower.
*  Feels like a tease.
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  They're not ready to lose yet, Detroit.
*  There'll be a time.
*  That's not yet.
*  Campbell's definitely got the Drago's trainer face
*  going during these games.
*  He just wants to like pour it on.
*  Yeah!
*  Seahawks Cardinals in Seattle.
*  And I was gonna go one and a half
*  and I'm gonna say Seahawks minus two after today.
*  You get it.
*  It's one and a half.
*  I said four.
*  Why are...
*  Cardinals have had a really good month.
*  I know.
*  They're getting a little too much credit here.
*  Little too much.
*  Two fairly watchables.
*  Vikings at Chicago is the first one.
*  Something is not watchable about the Vikings
*  and I can't put my finger on it,
*  but I'm never like,
*  oh cool, the Vikings are on offense.
*  And they have guys I like watching.
*  Something's missing.
*  Yeah, we don't like when you have a big play guy,
*  a top three fantasy guy, Justin Jefferson,
*  and who never seems to be at the box.
*  Struggling to score.
*  I think they averaged 30 over their first four games
*  and the last two or three,
*  they've averaged like 15 or something.
*  I'm gonna say Vikings by three in Chicago.
*  You're gonna get this.
*  I said four and a half, it's three and a half.
*  I think that ends at three.
*  Did they play yet?
*  No, they play week 15.
*  I think that goes down.
*  Yeah, I think that gets to three.
*  Dolphins home for the Pats is the other one.
*  And I swear the Pats aren't bad.
*  You swear, you wouldn't lie to me?
*  I swear they're not bad.
*  And you can't tell me you weren't
*  fucking sweating out that Rams game.
*  No, I was.
*  I was, yeah.
*  I'm glad they kicked.
*  Pats lose to Seattle 23 to 20
*  in a game that they coach scared
*  and they had Berset instead of May.
*  They lose week five to Miami
*  when they should have started May.
*  I think they would have won that.
*  They lost that one 15 to 10.
*  They lost that stupid Tennessee game
*  in week nine by three
*  and they lost this Rams game today.
*  It's a three and a team that could,
*  like they really could be six and seven.
*  Couple plays.
*  They're not bad.
*  Whatever you say.
*  I don't know how the three and eight
*  gets to six and seven.
*  They really could have played two more games
*  in 11 weeks?
*  I wasn't asked to do math.
*  The question is, do they have any,
*  how many blowouts do they have?
*  I look at the Cowboys, I'm like,
*  oh, we have at least three or four.
*  You have none.
*  You have no blowout.
*  Receiving end of a blowout, I'm saying.
*  Oh yeah, we got blowout a couple times.
*  Yeah, Houston got us.
*  No, no, but coming up,
*  are you gonna have two or three or,
*  you have what, seven games, right?
*  Miami, Indy, Arizona, Buffalo, Chargers, Buffalo.
*  Six games left.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I have that, Pat's over under four and a half
*  and they have three wins.
*  You're fighting that out, end of December for sure.
*  But think about it, at Miami, home, Indy,
*  at Arizona, at Buffalo, Chargers, Buffalo.
*  Probably only one win left with this coaching stuff.
*  You gotta hit this exact, I got this exactly.
*  You did?
*  I'm gonna say Miami by six and a half.
*  Oh, you should've said seven.
*  Very close though.
*  I would advise people not to tease that.
*  I just don't.
*  That seems like a classic Miami looking ahead game.
*  Who does Miami play the week after this?
*  They play.
*  Well, that's Thanksgiving week, right?
*  Yeah, they're at Green Bay on Thursday that next week.
*  So this is a classic, hey, it's the Pats.
*  Let's just, we'll get by this.
*  We got Green Bay on Thursday
*  and then all of a sudden we're up 10-0.
*  You played tough with them last time, right?
*  Wasn't it like 15-10, is that what you said?
*  Yeah, I think we can play with that team.
*  Now the reason these games are so shitty
*  is because six teams are off, right?
*  We forgot to mention that.
*  Buffalo, Cincinnati.
*  Some huge fantasy implications.
*  Yeah, there's some teams with fantasy guys.
*  So the poopfecta is loaded.
*  We might need the clogger to unclog it.
*  Really, some doozies.
*  There's five Bucks Giants in Jersey.
*  Bucks minus four.
*  Yeah, you get it.
*  I said five, it's three and a half, stupid.
*  That's dumb.
*  Except that we're gonna bet Tampa to win the division,
*  so they're definitely gonna lose to the Giants.
*  Yeah, so we kinda need to do that
*  because I need to be interested in week 12.
*  So maybe that's the first way to do it.
*  Let's do it. Bet the Bucks.
*  Washington is home for the Cowboys.
*  Watch out.
*  God only knows how bad you're gonna look tomorrow.
*  Watch out.
*  I have Washington by eight.
*  Man, you're edging me out here.
*  I had seven and a half, it's nine and a half.
*  That's too bad.
*  Washington doesn't look good in a month.
*  Well, Cowboys haven't looked good six years in a month.
*  So. Fair.
*  Fair.
*  Should be interesting.
*  Oh, you don't think the schedule can get worse?
*  Can I offer you Chiefs Panthers in Carolina?
*  Yeah.
*  You could offer me a three team teaser.
*  Well, that's why I'm jacking this up
*  because they're gonna have, this will be in the tease range.
*  I'm gonna say Chiefs by 11 and a half in Carolina.
*  I can't get one of these.
*  I had 12, it's 10 and a half.
*  They can't lose that.
*  Put that on any teaser from now,
*  however long you think you're gonna be betting,
*  15, 20 more years, 40.
*  Just try to get them on whatever Fandol will allow.
*  I had another 14 or 13 pointer, by the way.
*  Oh, I saw that.
*  Wait.
*  Chargers plus 11, Chiefs, Lions,
*  and then the Eagles on Thursday night.
*  Oh, you must have, oh, you sent me something else
*  with the two.
*  The UFC.
*  No, I hit that thing.
*  Yeah, I hit the UFC one too.
*  Look at you, hitting everything.
*  Bo Nicol with John Jones,
*  who could not have been more amazing in that fight.
*  And then the Lions and the Packers was basically even odds.
*  John Jones figured out how to do a liver punch
*  as a spinning back kick.
*  Right, yeah.
*  I've never seen a UFC move that looked like it hurt
*  more than that move.
*  Yeah, you don't usually see.
*  If they did that to us, what would happen to us?
*  I would still, no, I would still be,
*  I'd say I'd still be in the ring,
*  but I think they would carry me to my grave.
*  So I don't think I would still be in the ring.
*  Yeah, no, his foot went right through.
*  That would break like five ribs, right?
*  It looked like it really,
*  like he was gonna have trouble getting his foot out
*  of that sternum, right?
*  I thought he was so good.
*  Stipe was terrible.
*  Stipe looked like he was kind of washed.
*  But John Jones was like, he played all the hits.
*  Like he did the ground and pound in the first round.
*  He's just like, he has this ways of just like,
*  it's like 20 elbows and 19 of them land.
*  He was so good.
*  Someone gave Stipe a round, which was insane.
*  Jesus.
*  It's one of the judges there.
*  Two more terrible games, Texans, Titans.
*  This is in Houston.
*  And I really, I thought about getting this to nine
*  because I know they're gonna think everyone's gonna tease it,
*  but the Texans just haven't been good enough.
*  So I'm gonna say Texans eight and a half.
*  I hate when you're explaining it
*  and I know you have me dead to rights,
*  but I still have to listen to the whole thing.
*  And keep a poker face?
*  Yeah, I had nine and it is eight and a half.
*  This is disgraceful.
*  That's a slightly dangerous game for Houston
*  because Tennessee's defense isn't bad.
*  Short week for Houston.
*  Short week for Houston.
*  Battle, that's gonna be a battle against the Cowboys.
*  Very physical.
*  You know, this one might not be a poopfected game
*  with the way Bo Nix is playing,
*  but Broncos in Vegas playing the Raiders
*  and Bobby Bockele, Antonio Pierce.
*  Yeah.
*  I was saying to you and Lombardi that Bobby Bockele
*  was Uncle Junior's driver for two years
*  and then somehow a couple people died
*  and he became a captain.
*  Right.
*  And it was like, how is this guy a captain?
*  He was getting Uncle Junior, Baba Ghoul.
*  Yeah.
*  What did they call that?
*  What's that saying?
*  Baba Ghoul.
*  Baba Ghoul.
*  What did they call it?
*  Baba Ghoul?
*  That was Karen's last lasagna.
*  I've never heard of Gabbadool before.
*  You're not saying it right.
*  It's okay.
*  Gabbadool?
*  Gabbadool.
*  It's like your daughter's first words.
*  Now I don't even know what it is.
*  Not in the Connecticut, Massachusetts area.
*  But yeah, it was like Antonio Pierce,
*  they just cut to him on the sidelines
*  and he just has this look like,
*  what if I'm gonna be able to do TV next year?
*  What if there's gonna be a college job?
*  Broncos, I'm gonna say minus four in Vegas.
*  All right.
*  You get it either way.
*  But this, I said three, it was three and a half.
*  It went to four and a half.
*  What kind of injury could there be on Vegas
*  for them to move this a line?
*  I know their running backs both got hurt,
*  but it was like Amir Abdul or whatever,
*  but why did this move within an hour?
*  Did you see any of the Vegas game?
*  Oh, I know they're terrible.
*  Yeah.
*  Menchu had a play where in the fourth quarter
*  he rolled out and he threw a pass
*  and I think it was Jalen Ramsey,
*  he fell down so he was on the ground.
*  The guy was open and Menchu somehow threw it
*  to Jalen Ramsey who caught it
*  when he was lying on the ground for an interception.
*  I didn't ever see that before.
*  That's good.
*  Tough times for Menchu.
*  Jesus.
*  I love, I just want so badly to bet that team,
*  but they gotta be a stay away for the rest of the year.
*  Sunday night, Eagles Rams in LA, not a bad game.
*  I have a crowd prediction for this.
*  There's a lot of Philly fans that live here.
*  Oh yeah.
*  You put a lot of Philly fans together
*  and if the game becomes frustrating or disappointing
*  in the first or second quarter,
*  the vibe slash energy in that arena or stadium
*  completely changes and gets super weird.
*  I feel like that's gonna happen in this game.
*  You put 50,000 Eagle fans who are furious
*  because Sirianni went for it on fourth and three
*  and Jalen Hurts got sacked.
*  You can hear the grumbling all around the stadium.
*  I'll never forget the Super Bowl, Eagles Pats.
*  It was the weirdest energy I've ever felt in a game.
*  The Eagles fans are so mad.
*  It was like in the second quarter, they're furious.
*  But those are Eagles fans.
*  These are gonna be LA Eagles fans, right?
*  You think they're gonna be more mellow
*  because we have good weather?
*  No, probably not.
*  Yeah, I don't think so either.
*  I'll be bad.
*  But this means more to the Rams for sure.
*  I do not have the Rams favorites, Sal.
*  I have Eagles minus one and a half.
*  Yeah, I said two and it's three.
*  Eagles are a full field goal.
*  Wow, they're rarely seen three.
*  I think they're counting on what you're talking about.
*  A lot of Eagles fans showing up there.
*  There's a lot of Bengals fans.
*  We're gonna get a lot of Eagles fans.
*  Did I clinch yet or is this still up in the air?
*  Why, you wanna quit?
*  No.
*  Yeah, it's like nine to three.
*  I pull my starters.
*  Yeah, full mall, nine to three, you're up.
*  Last game, Monday night, we get to watch the Chargers again.
*  Oh, oh my.
*  Ravens at Chargers.
*  Ravens in LA.
*  I wonder if Mallory Rubin will be in the house.
*  I bet she will.
*  She doesn't leave her own house,
*  but she might be in this house.
*  I'm gonna say Baltimore by one and a half.
*  Are they checking on an injury because it's not on fans?
*  I pulled it up before and now it's not on.
*  You look there, but what'd you say?
*  We both have one and a half anyway.
*  It's three.
*  It's the last I saw.
*  But is Herbert hurt or somebody?
*  Herbert might be.
*  Maybe he got hurt when they ran that play
*  when he just got that option play
*  when he just got annihilated and Collins was like,
*  please don't ever run that play again.
*  His right arm is tight.
*  He could throw left handed if he wants.
*  He wants him still.
*  He's still handsome either way, Mike.
*  Of course.
*  All right, you won.
*  Seven, four, one after 12.
