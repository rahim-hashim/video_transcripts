# NFL Futures Draft with Cousin Sal  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1OdkdT0Zg4)
*  We like so many NFL futures.
*  We just decided to do a draft.
*  And if we take one from the other one, so be it.
*  So the whoever goes first, then you go second and third.
*  I go fourth and fifth.
*  So we get two in a row.
*  I think we should say we're putting like 50 K fake dollars on each one of these or
*  something to just see that add the tally up at the end of the year.
*  What do you think?
*  Let me ask you then.
*  So could I just pick first and go no undefeated teams minus 3,500 or no, it has to be.
*  No.
*  I thought about that.
*  I think we should try to keep it like even odds or plus.
*  And if you want to have like one or two in the in the minus 150 minus 175 range, go
*  for it.
*  But we want to have a longer shot.
*  That's fine.
*  That's good.
*  It's fine.
*  Yeah.
*  All right.
*  You want to go first?
*  You want to go first or you want me to go first?
*  Let's let the California lottery determine it.
*  We'll wait till night.
*  We'll add up the balls.
*  It's okay.
*  You go first.
*  I'll go first.
*  I'll go to my favorite future.
*  Yeah.
*  So we talked about this on, uh, on the NFC over under podcast and I challenged Fandol.
*  I was like, I think the NFC South's probably going to win like, I don't know, 24, 25 games
*  backs, put some chest hair on Fandol, put this on your sports book app, put it in
*  futures fusion, the hottest nightclub in, uh, in LA right now, put it in there.
*  Let's see it.
*  So Fandol, they put up NFC South under 30 wins.
*  So 29 and under you win and it's plus one 55.
*  So the NFC South has 30 combined wins.
*  You lose that one.
*  I talked about it in the NFC thing.
*  I think the NFC South is going to be a dumpster fire.
*  I would be shocked if anyone's even in the high twenties from this.
*  Yeah, no, of course that's a good one.
*  I think you added it up and it was 31, right?
*  Is the actual number for all the wins.
*  So they're adjusting it.
*  Yeah, this is a good one.
*  All right.
*  I'm trying to figure out how it loses.
*  And I think here, here's the, here's the case study.
*  So Atlanta schedule is so easy.
*  If Atlanta just becomes like the super easy schedule, nobody believes in them.
*  They're 12 and five, but everybody can't wait to get bet against them in the playoffs.
*  I think that has to happen.
*  I think Carolina has to be maybe a little better.
*  There's some, that's the main Carolina can't screw you.
*  Everyone else will be around seven.
*  Carolina can't be seven.
*  That's it.
*  They got to get out of it.
*  There's some like slate bus with Carolina.
*  I'm like, I don't know, maybe 11 to one to win the division.
*  I don't see it at all.
*  I think they're going to be awful.
*  Um, so anyway, plus one 55.
*  That's my bet.
*  All right.
*  You got the next tip.
*  All right.
*  I'll go as another one we discussed.
*  I really, really love this and it pays six to one exact order of finish Detroit,
*  Green Bay, Chicago, Minnesota.
*  Of course you could switch that around.
*  Go Chicago, Green Bay for second, third.
*  I think he gets seven to one, but I really like what we settled on.
*  Uh, lions Packers bears Vikings.
*  Cause I'm really, I haven't been this confident in a first place team and a
*  fourth place team finished in a while.
*  I think, I think we have the right one for second and third six.
*  So that's the NFC North exact order six to one, which has been on there for a
*  month or so, and they have them for every division and they have every combination.
*  That is by far my favorite one.
*  Okay.
*  Because that really the only way you probably lose it is if Green Bay
*  somehow is better than Detroit.
*  And that I don't, I think that Chicago, Minnesota three, four combo.
*  I'm locking that in.
*  I don't see any chance Chicago's better wins wise than Detroit or Green Bay.
*  And you and I are both, we talked about it a few days ago.
*  You and I are both super bullish on Detroit.
*  Let's just commit to those two bets.
*  The NFC South under, and what I just went over and let's watch the rest of the year.
*  Why do we have to go crazy on ourselves?
*  So I had that as my third most favorite future.
*  So you took one from me, but the plus 600 is great.
*  So if we're doing 50 K per bet and you hit that one, you'll have a lead.
*  I will have hit my bet and still you'll be winning me.
*  All right.
*  What's your other one?
*  I'm going to go same division here.
*  I have to decide between, I like both of these and I actually, you could
*  take one if I do the other.
*  I like Caleb Williams to lead the league in interceptions.
*  Oh, Tina one, but I also like him over 11 and a half interceptions.
*  All right.
*  I'm going to go over 11 and a half interceptions minus one 12.
*  That is asking a lot for a rookie quarterback to come in there and have
*  fewer than 12 interceptions, but all three secondaries are pretty good.
*  Even Minnesota's, you know, there are some blue chippers in there.
*  12 interceptions is not a bad year.
*  If he has like 27 touchdowns and 12 interceptions, that's not bad at all.
*  And he's going to make some mistakes.
*  And you know, if he plays, it's less than one a game.
*  Give me Caleb over 11 and a half.
*  I NTS.
*  What is the juice on that?
*  Minus one 12.
*  That's really good.
*  I was looking at that most interceptions bet.
*  It was, it was shocking.
*  Josh, Josh Allen was one of the favorites.
*  Oh, and then I looked it up last year and he had 18 picks last year.
*  I was like, oh yeah, I forgot.
*  Yeah.
*  He threw a ton of picks, but usually there's the bad QB who gets to play all
*  the time, like last year was Sam Howell.
*  And I think he might either he finished with the most or he was right there.
*  The year before it was Davis Mills.
*  So I have, I have one for this a little later that I was, I was looking at.
*  All right.
*  So I have two in a row.
*  I'm going to, I want to do one longer shot and one that I just really like, but
*  both of them are based in the AFC South.
*  They have a little DNA in the AFC South, the division that I think both of us.
*  Are intrigued by this year.
*  Um, first one, Mahomes, CJ Stroud and Trevor Lawrence, all to throw for 4,000
*  yards parlay plus four Oh three.
*  So I looked at this.
*  Lawrence has thrown for 4,000 yards in two of the last three years, including
*  last year when he had a hundred injuries.
*  Um, Mahomes would have to get hurt to miss this and Stroud first 12 games
*  last year through for 3,500 yards.
*  Missed a couple of games, came back, still finished over 4,000 and now
*  the receivers are better.
*  And I mean, I basically somebody would have to get hurt for them to miss this.
*  And four to one is tasty.
*  And I was trying to, I was looking at the history of 4,000 yard throwers, which
*  is a little easier now that we have the extra game, but there's usually between
*  like maybe eight and 10 that do it each year.
*  And I think these are going to be three of the eight.
*  So plus four Oh three.
*  What do you think of that one?
*  I like that.
*  You just need, you need 16 games out of them, right?
*  Someone plays 15, 15, 15, 15.
*  I guess you could do that's 15 is 20, 600, uh, two, six game.
*  That's not bad.
*  Yeah, I like that.
*  All right.
*  Okay.
*  And then my second one, we've talked about it a lot.
*  I picked them to make the super bowl.
*  They were one of my seven AFC super bowl picks and our AFC over under, um,
*  Houston to win the AFC south, which the odds have dropped and is now dead even.
*  It's plus 100 for them to win the AFC south.
*  The only team I'm afraid of for this a little bit is Jacksonville, but, uh, I
*  just, I'm all in on this Houston team.
*  I think CJ is going to be really good.
*  And as I said the other day, I think he's, if he's healthy and he has a good
*  team, I just think he's 11 wins going forward.
*  So the fact that this isn't minus yet, like this is plus 100, but Philly's
*  minus one 40 to win the NFC East.
*  Just seems like good value.
*  So that's my other one.
*  Okay.
*  I like that.
*  I mean, I have Jaguars to win knowing, cause I think it's going to come down to
*  the last week and I'd rather have good odds money, but yeah, good odds.
*  Uh, all right.
*  I get two here.
*  So let me go come back player of the year, Kirk Cousins.
*  It was five to one.
*  You can get it at plus four 30.
*  Now I think I mentioned on the NFC pod, he had 18 touchdowns.
*  He led the league before he got injured.
*  Um, I think he's gonna put up good numbers with that team, right?
*  Dare I say Kyle Pitts, Drake London, uh, I think they're going to be okay this year.
*  And, um, so right there, I think we discount, I'd rather not take the saints
*  or Falcons or anything else to win a division, but I think cousins will put up
*  good numbers.
*  I don't think Rogers will as much and, and burrow.
*  I don't, uh, I dunno, I don't want to count injuries against anybody, but I
*  think cousins four 30 is a good one.
*  So I didn't have a comeback bet out of my 31 futures I have prepared for this
*  draft.
*  And the reason is I really like cousins at plus four 30, but I asked, I was
*  afraid of Rogers and Rogers was, what was he like plus two 20 plus two 30,
*  something like that.
*  I didn't understand why they weren't the exact same odds because if either of
*  them win the division, they're probably going to be the favorite to be come back
*  player of the year.
*  Right?
*  So I don't know why Rogers would be above cousins.
*  They had the same injury.
*  They're playing for these teams that are in like that nine to 10 win range with a
*  chance to win the division.
*  And, uh, I thought cousins had the best odds.
*  I just, it didn't make the cut for me.
*  I had a lot of ones.
*  I like, yeah, cause his team's expected to win the division where the Bengals
*  aren't and the jets aren't either.
*  So, um, there was some weird one in the comebacks.
*  They really were thrown in everybody.
*  Oh, they're trying to get a hundred to one.
*  They're putting in, you know, people you didn't even know were still in the
*  Grady Jarrett.
*  What is Grady Jarrett?
*  What kind of stats is Grady Jarrett have to have to win CPOY?
*  Yeah.
*  Can you imagine like week nine?
*  We're like, I don't know, man.
*  Grady Jarrett.
*  He looks like he almost has this locked up.
*  Damn.
*  Why don't we bet that?
*  Tim Patrick, I think is on a practice squad.
*  He's a hundred to one.
*  That's good stuff.
*  I mean, I get one more.
*  Oh yeah, I got it.
*  It seems like Ricky Pierce all is going to be okay.
*  I think he should probably be in there, right?
*  The Diga fucking shot yesterday.
*  So if he has like 40 catches, I think he would have to be one of the favorites.
*  That's interesting.
*  We never talked about a rookie to win comeback player of the year.
*  You can win both awards.
*  Unbelievable guys.
*  Just walking around downtown San Francisco.
*  All right.
*  What's your, what's your other one?
*  All right.
*  For my second here coming around, I'm going Kenneth Walker, most rushing yards,
*  NFC West.
*  Now this is dependent probably on McCaffrey get getting injured, maybe missing a
*  couple of games.
*  Maybe they hold them out.
*  Maybe they're going for the one seed, whatever it is.
*  So I need McCaffrey to miss some games.
*  I need Kieran Williams to be named the punt returner for the Rams, which seems
*  like it already happened.
*  Plus three 60 Kenneth Walker right around a thousand 1100 yards.
*  I have him away too many fantasy leagues, but I'm sticking with this.
*  I think it's a good enough.
*  Well, and then James Connor, maybe him not going crazy, but I think it's a really
*  smart one because everyone's going nuts about him.
*  He definitely is probably the most hyped higher end running back in any fantasy
*  league and then the McCaffrey who knows calf hamstrings.
*  I like it.
*  Plus three.
*  I'm surprised the odds are that high.
*  I would have thought the odds would have been like in the plus two 50 range.
*  So those are good ones.
*  All right.
*  For my next two, I'm going to go to Detroit for both.
*  I'm trying to do themes with my combos.
*  We talked about this a bunch on, uh, on our two parter Detroit for the one seed
*  plus four 80, I just, I just think the value is, especially with San Francisco
*  with some year from hell potential with San Francisco and then the NFC East.
*  I'm not sure which one comes out of there.
*  I don't like anyone in the NFC South.
*  I just think the one seat is coming from the NFC North, whether it's
*  Green Bear or Detroit.
*  And we talked about Detroit with all the indoor games, Detroit, loading up
*  to trick, getting a taste last year, but not getting the Superbowl hangover.
*  And I just think they're built to beat the shit out of teams this year, which
*  ties into my, so that's plus four 80.
*  And that ties into my second one, which is eight and Hutchinson for most sacks.
*  11 to one.
*  Right.
*  So you figure if this is, if Detroit's a juggernaut, which I think they're going
*  to be at least for the regular season and you're having leads and the other
*  teams throwing a lot and you're putting a lot of pressure on them and the crowds.
*  I liked the way he looked last year and what is most sacks?
*  Maybe he, I think he had like 11 or 12 last year.
*  Maybe it's maybe get to 17 this year.
*  Who's he competing against Parsons?
*  What, uh, one of the bosses, Garrett, but I think he probably needs to get to 17,
*  18, but on a team that's running it up, I could see it.
*  I could see him having like a five sack game against some terrible team where
*  they're just killing them.
*  So 11 to one for Hutchinson.
*  That was my other one.
*  He's got a little help this year.
*  I like that.
*  Um, all right, I'll give you one.
*  Uh, I think I gave this out when we did the AFC, uh, Tyree killed 13 or
*  more receiving touchdowns plus three 60.
*  I mentioned it.
*  I don't understand this number.
*  He's hit this two of the last four years.
*  He has 13 and 15 touchdowns.
*  He had like 119 catches the last two years.
*  He had like 34 red zone targets last year, which is insane.
*  Um, you know, he scores five touchdowns, 50 yards or more every season.
*  So I'm, I like this right there as long as he stays healthy.
*  What's the juice on that one?
*  Plus three 60 there.
*  Plus three 60 for 13 or more.
*  Do you like the odor from this Miami team?
*  I let, I'm going to use odor is going to be my go-to word this year.
*  Do you like the odor from this team this year?
*  I was, I was reading up on that.
*  The owners like Serena Williams and, uh,
*  odor, the smell, the vibe, the look.
*  I mean, they're starting this week one.
*  They have a bunch of injuries and guys questionable already.
*  I don't know.
*  I know you're trying to bait.
*  You've been baiting JJ on our text chain, but, um, he's, uh, we, he has
*  to defend his team like I do.
*  Yeah, maybe.
*  I don't know.
*  If it's a year from hell team, Tyreek will be part of that and it'll be like
*  a pulled hammy or whatever, but the plus three 60, I can't argue with the juice.
*  What's your other one?
*  All right.
*  I'm going to go another receiver here.
*  See the lamb Homer call probably most receiving yards in the NFC East plus one
*  15 he beat AJ Brown, who was second by 300 yards last year, like it wasn't even
*  close and who are we looking at?
*  Anyway, after that neighbors, no, McLaurin, McLaurin, like those guys
*  aren't going to get to 14, 1500 yards plus one 15 is better than picking like
*  a division winner, I think, uh, and the NFC East.
*  So that's my second one.
*  So are they saying basically it's him versus the two Eagles guys and they
*  feel like that's dead even?
*  Cause it feels like to me, Lam should be like minus one 50 for that.
*  Yeah, right.
*  It will be after this podcast, but I would jump on that.
*  Well, go, go to futures fusion drinks are half price during happy hour.
*  Okay.
*  I'm doing two paths for my next two.
*  You know where I stand on this paths is, and you try to talk me out of it.
*  There's been some action on the Bengals paths line, which we'll talk about when
*  we do guess the lines, even though we already guessed them first one, the paths
*  to be the last winless team is plus 500.
*  And if you look at their schedule, and especially the fact that they're
*  going to play present this first four weeks, they're super unhappy with
*  how the offensive line looks.
*  And it just feels like they're going to start in that Oh, and six, oh, and seven
*  range, the other teams are Tennessee plus seven 50 who, I don't know.
*  I could see them stealing a game in the first month.
*  Carolina's plus eight 50 there.
*  People think they could just beat New Orleans and week one,
*  Minnesota's plus nine 50 giants, 11 to one Broncos 13 one.
*  So to get big action on paths to be last one, this one naming Burset was their
*  admission. We're going to suck this year.
*  We don't even want to risk our rookie quarterback, even though he like Jared
*  man, Jared may I was like, yeah, may I played Burset.
*  And then two days later is like, our starting quarterback is Jacobi Burset.
*  So I, this is a team that doesn't seem like it wants to win plus 500.
*  All right.
*  I mean, you, this is the theme, right?
*  I have to, I have to defend my team to the end and you have to say that yours is
*  going to be terrible.
*  That's just get, get ready for people.
*  This is what our year is going to look like.
*  Well, we are terrible.
*  It's not, it's not like I'm going to have to go out on a limb.
*  It's going to be a bad team.
*  The only thing I'll say is I think we looked it over in the NFC.
*  So the giants play the Vikings this week and it's a murderous schedule for
*  Minnesota. If they lose this not great for the giants either.
*  And I think you can get nine 50 and 11 to one for both of those two.
*  But I mean, yeah, Patriots will be right in there.
*  Yeah. Minnesota was another one I was looking at cause it already seems like
*  you know, things are moving against them.
*  They've had some injuries.
*  They have, I don't know what happens with Addison.
*  Like a good deal just decides after week two, he's now on that you cannot play
*  anymore list, but they go giants San Fran, Houston at green Bay jets by Detroit.
*  And then at Rams week eight, I was looking at them too, but yeah, but yeah,
*  they're well, we'll talk about them and the giants, but it does feel like whoever
*  wins that game, the loser is probably the past competition for that bet, which
*  your other one, uh, it's, it's my turn.
*  All right.
*  Did you do two in a row?
*  Yeah.
*  No, no, you did.
*  That was, yeah, it's my turn.
*  All right.
*  Sticking with the paths for this second one, Pat's under four and a half.
*  And then Seattle over eight and a half wins.
*  I really liked the Seattle team and, uh, I think they're, they might be coming up
*  later with a couple more bets for me, but I like everything I'm reading,
*  everything I'm hearing.
*  I like their roster.
*  I like that they actually have a home field advantage or on paper.
*  They at least do.
*  I like the first game week one start now they're going to be favored.
*  They should take care of business.
*  And I just think there are nine or a 10 win team.
*  So that plus Pat's under four and a half is three to one plus 300.
*  And instead of betting Seattle, I would just rather throw the paths in there
*  because the paths aren't going five and 12.
*  So that's not bad.
*  Not bad.
*  Is this on the futures fusion or the guest aligns with Bill and Sal
*  sec section of Fandl?
*  I it's on what it might even be both.
*  It might both bars are open.
*  Dude, our kids are going to get kicked out of futures fusion for showing fake
*  ID, aren't they?
*  Are college kids.
*  So we just got a fake ID to get into futures fusion.
*  I think is what's happening.
*  It's not going to work.
*  No, it doesn't work.
*  All right.
*  We're going to continue the futures draft.
*  I think it's going pretty well.
*  Uh, yeah, we haven't lost anything.
*  Yeah.
*  You haven't lost any money.
*  We're just throwing, throwing fake money around left and right.
*  What do you got next?
*  I can't believe you don't like this or haven't picked this.
*  And because you're, you're anti-patriots and pro lions, guess the lines with
*  Bill Sal, our very own section has lions, best record, Patriots worst record 36
*  to one I'm going for it, taking a stab here and at $50,000, I think that pays.
*  I don't know.
*  36 billion, something, something, somewhere in there.
*  I had it.
*  I had it later.
*  I like those other two and I already did the lions for something, but yeah, I,
*  I gotta be honest.
*  I don't know why that's so high.
*  36 to one where it's like, on the one hand, the Alliance team that I think the
*  chiefs is the only real competition for that one seat, if you really believe in
*  the lions and then the Pat.
*  So I think it's, they're one of the three worst teams, no question.
*  I thought that would be like 12 to one.
*  So great odds.
*  Well, there's about three teams in contention on both sides.
*  And I'm also sticking with the guests of lines with Bill Sal section, at least
*  three of Falcons Texans, chiefs and jets to make the playoffs.
*  This is a heavy VIG.
*  I'm not doing anyone any favors at minus one 60, but you could get all four.
*  There's a way to get all four for sure.
*  Falcons Texans, chiefs and jets.
*  Three of them are favorites to win their divisions.
*  Yes.
*  I'm trying to think what is the juice on that?
*  Minus one 60.
*  So I apologize.
*  No, I like that.
*  Yeah.
*  So Casey locked them in Atlanta is a little dangerous and then they're, they're
*  basically banking that maybe Houston and Jacksonville don't make it.
*  So yeah, that's.
*  Fair.
*  I mean, this is to make the playoffs.
*  It's not even to win the division.
*  So Atlanta, I don't think, you know, I like your thing where they all go under,
*  but could they get a wild card?
*  I guess, you know, well, I should add that I have all four of those
*  teams to make the playoffs.
*  And in fact, my next pick is the Jacksonville Jaguars.
*  So this is an adjusted all win total.
*  Cause they're all total is eight and a half, but you and I both went over.
*  We had a lot of acrimony in our AFC over unders, but then we actually, we
*  bonded over the Jaguars.
*  We both liked them a lot.
*  They're over nine and a half wins.
*  And again, credit to Rahim because he's been all over the alt wind from the get
*  go, like if you like somebody, you're better off really liking them and getting
*  better juice.
*  So Jags over nine and a half wins is plus one 76.
*  And I got to 10 and seven and I hit that.
*  And I think they can go 10 and seven and I actually think they, they will
*  unless somebody gets injured.
*  So I love that one.
*  Stand in the AFC South, um, Stroud most passing yards plus 700.
*  And I think his competition's probably Dak.
*  Right.
*  Dak, if he plays all 17 and they're going to throw the ball a lot, especially
*  if there's no running backs, I think would be the other one to look at.
*  But I just think, I think Stroud's going to wing the ball around and, um, you
*  know, they got mixing and Pierce and acres of running back like that.
*  It's not like they're going to be rushing for 3000 yards.
*  I think they're going to want to throw the ball and move it, make big plays
*  and strike big and don't have to worry about whether he's probably just going
*  to get better.
*  I like that.
*  Seven to one.
*  I like the S all right.
*  You're up.
*  All right.
*  Um, I'm going to go in under a quarterback.
*  Sam Darnold under 34, 75 and a half.
*  So he's got to start these games out for the Vikings with McCarthy out.
*  It's minus one 12.
*  I think he could get yanked.
*  They could do something weird in there.
*  Right.
*  And you see the Vikings, what'd they do last year?
*  Who they have in there?
*  Were they, we loved them for a month.
*  And then like he was Josh Dobbs, Jaren Hall got a cup of coffee in there.
*  And, uh, there's somebody else terrible.
*  I'm Kirk cousins.
*  There's a Josh Dobbs.
*  There's a Jaren Hall in there.
*  There's a, yeah, there's, there's, there's plenty of those.
*  I don't know if he makes it to the finish line.
*  He might not get to 3,500, even if he plays all 17 games.
*  So Sam Darnold under 34, 75 and a half.
*  He'll maybe have a couple of good weeks to start and get everyone
*  excited, but that'll be that.
*  I really like that one.
*  That's a great one.
*  Congratulations.
*  The great value here.
*  Well, just look at those unders for, you know, they don't have to go brag about
*  it when these guys get injured or whatever, but a lot of good unders for
*  guys who might get yanked or injured, um, in that quarterback spot.
*  Uh, I love this one.
*  Fandl has assistant coach of the year, Ben Johnson,
*  offensive coordinator for lions.
*  We love the lions.
*  This guy's come in second or third in this voting for the last two years.
*  You can get him at nine to one.
*  If you think the lions are going to be explosive as I do, and I think you do,
*  uh, it's gotta be his year at some point.
*  He gets votes.
*  You got like 65 votes last year.
*  So where is this?
*  Like, is this bed in a speakeasy in the futures fusion basement?
*  Where, I didn't even know where to find this.
*  What is it under?
*  It's on the rewards.
*  Check it out.
*  Yeah.
*  It's right there.
*  Oh my God.
*  I somehow missed it for the Patriots.
*  What was that?
*  Van Pelt or something for, he was like 250 to when you sent that to me, I thought
*  you were kidding.
*  I didn't realize that was an actual word that people can get on.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh my God.
*  So those are my two.
*  What I'm probably, I probably have the wrong state downloaded.
*  So Ben Johnson's nine to one.
*  Who's this competition then?
*  Nine to one.
*  Some awesome defensive coordinator.
*  The problem is it's been defensive coordinators the last few years, so he's
*  got to, he's got to get over that for sure.
*  But I got to figure, I don't have it up here, but let's see real quick.
*  Wait, wait, real quick.
*  Uh, I really liked that one.
*  Great job, Bobby, Bobby slow it for the Texans is nine to one.
*  And you'll see for them.
*  Yeah.
*  Drew Petsing for the card.
*  And they'll got a guy named Drew Petsing is going to win.
*  I'm sorry, but God.
*  Great stuff.
*  Okay.
*  My next two, both overs fun to have the overs.
*  I don't want to get too negative as they dive into the season, like
*  having some teams to root for.
*  We talked about both of these teams when we did our pod, the
*  chargers over eight and a half.
*  I'm all in on Harbaugh and it's going to come down that week one.
*  They're playing the Raiders and you like the Raiders.
*  I like the chargers and I think if they can win that one, they're off.
*  And then Green Bay over eight and a half.
*  So their overs nine and a half, but this is an over eight and a half.
*  So both teams to win nine games.
*  Chargers, they're going to win.
*  Chargers packers three to one plus 300.
*  Put that together.
*  It sounds great.
*  Cause I'm not worried about the Packers for the Packers to lose that.
*  They'd have to have a losing record.
*  They have way too much sound.
*  I have a losing record.
*  So basically you're betting on the chargers over anyway, but you get to
*  throw the Packers in there at a nice price.
*  That's one.
*  Why don't even need, they don't even need to make the playoffs, right?
*  Right.
*  Go nine and eight.
*  And you're good.
*  All right.
*  I like that.
*  I'm going against the NFC South again.
*  This is, I'm planning my flag in the NFC South sucks Island, uh, NFC East.
*  More wins than the NFC South minus one 75.
*  I think this is my only minus future.
*  It's in, they have a bunch of, they put that in futures fusion.
*  Oh, you just got to ask where the tequila is.
*  What a bounty this is top shelf.
*  This must be top shelf futures fusion.
*  Yeah.
*  So I was, I was going through it and let's say the giants and the panthers.
*  Let's just, let's just cancel them out.
*  Let's say they win the exact same amount of games.
*  I think Washington is better than anyone who doesn't win the
*  division in the NFC South.
*  And now I have the Eagles and Cowboys against the top two in the NFC South.
*  And I'm just, I'm winning with those.
*  I'm getting 20, 20 plus wins out of the Eagles Cowboys.
*  I'm not getting 20 plus wins out of any two NFC South names.
*  So minus one 75, one 75.
*  So the NFC, NFC East over unders are probably, um, 20.
*  They're probably like three or so, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's good.
*  Bad.
*  Somewhere in there.
*  All right.
*  I like that.
*  Yeah, that's good.
*  All right.
*  Is that your second pick or first?
*  Yeah, that's my second.
*  Oh, listen, the Rams, I don't know how they do it, but Sean McVay gets, I don't
*  know if it gets lucky or that it's a great GM, but there's always somebody,
*  whether it's a third round pick or first round pick jumps out.
*  Karen Williams was in his second year and we saw Cooper cup as a third round
*  pick and just these guys.
*  And of course, uh, Puka Nakua, um, set the record.
*  Jared versus the guy this year, the defensive end for Florida state.
*  He's going to win defensive rookie of the year at 10 to one.
*  Um, and everyone's going to be like the next Aaron Donald and everything.
*  You know, they don't really play the same position 10 to one for Jared verse.
*  Uh, I like it.
*  So who, who could beat him then?
*  Uh, I have one.
*  I have a different rookie of the year pick.
*  So I know I have a zag on that one, but I liked, I liked the odds on that.
*  We could say for that.
*  Uh, and I'll just go because you're going chargers at exactly the same amount.
*  I'm going Raiders over eight and a half, except I get a plus two 40, uh,
*  Minshew O'Connell.
*  I think they'll figure it out.
*  I know you hate this one, but I have to take a shot.
*  I want to Raiders over eight and a half plus two 40.
*  So that's an adjusted.
*  Right.
*  Okay.
*  Thank you, Reheme.
*  I don't understand the Raiders case at all.
*  I don't get it.
*  And I heard Reheme on East coast bias.
*  Shitting on the Steelers as having a good defense, but he doesn't understand
*  their offensive line and how they're going to score points.
*  And then this is the year Mike Toma doesn't have it.
*  And then 20 minutes later, he's like the Raiders, I know they're going to
*  struggle on offense, but I like their defense.
*  I'm like, the Raiders are the discount Steelers.
*  There's no way.
*  How could the, you can't make the case for one and not the other.
*  So I don't know.
*  I got mad at Reheme.
*  And so I'm walking along LA.
*  I'm like, God damn it, Reheme.
*  Don't get mad at Reheme.
*  Don't get mad at Reheme.
*  But if you have to pick three teams to replace last year's playoff teams, you're
*  going to have to have like a six and a half win projected in there, right?
*  Somewhere.
*  So that's where I'm at.
*  Okay.
*  You get to.
*  On that note, I think there's going to be three NFC West playoff teams.
*  And you can bet on that on Fanbill sports book and it's plus five 50.
*  And I would assume it's going to be San Francisco Seattle on the Rams.
*  I'm not going to completely rule out the Cardinals, especially with that, uh,
*  that week one in Buffalo looks a little upset ish.
*  Um, but I just don't like the NFC.
*  And, you know, if you got green Bay in Detroit, you got one NFC South team.
*  That's it.
*  That's only three teams.
*  Yeah.
*  And then if it's Dallas versus Philly for one spot in the NFC East, and then I got
*  my three NFC West teams, that's, that's my path.
*  So plus five 50, I like the odds.
*  I don't mind that.
*  And I feel like you could hedge that week 17.
*  You could probably 18.
*  You could, you can get one game.
*  Probably.
*  I can't wait to unsuccessfully hedge it where you have three options that
*  I'll somehow pick the wrong one.
*  Then the other one, I just, I don't understand the odds, especially when
*  we're all in all these fantasy drafts and he's been the first running back
*  taking it all of them.
*  And yet Breeze Hall to win the rushing title is plus nine 50.
*  And I don't understand why the odds aren't better because if you told me,
*  pick somebody to win the rushing title, just with no odds, just who do you
*  think is going to win the rushing title?
*  I would pick Breeze Hall.
*  So plus nine 50 sounds fantastic.
*  Sign me up.
*  Not bad.
*  Talk about a category where only like three guys can win.
*  If you've done any drafts this year, you know that that's, that's the case.
*  Three might be too many, but yeah, like plus nine 50.
*  Do you, do why do you think it's that high?
*  I don't know.
*  Um, I have no idea.
*  I think they're laughing at us.
*  Like you try to figure out which running backs good.
*  Now we're going to have some guy you've never even heard of.
*  You're jailing right or something.
*  So the odds are McCaffrey plus six 50 B John seven to one, who by the way, has
*  all Gira on his team, who's going to still get a lot of calories, Taylor eight
*  to one, Breeze nine to one, Barkley 10 to one, Derek Henry 11 to one.
*  I, I feel like I'm that that's like my
*  guess because McCaffrey McCaffrey is like the bell cow, right?
*  So it's just tough to, to overcome that.
*  But yeah, once he's out of the way.
*  Um, all right.
*  You're up for two.
*  Uh, listen, let me just go with Jayden Daniels.
*  I think I said it on the NFC podcast, uh, offensive rookie of the year.
*  Take all his overs.
*  I gave you Stroud last year for overall.
*  It's going to be Jayden Daniels.
*  He's going to be dynamite.
*  Lots of fun to watch.
*  And you didn't give the odds.
*  The odds are incredible.
*  To one.
*  Oh, they're six to one, right?
*  Still.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So Caleb is like plus one 30 range and Daniels is six to one.
*  And I don't understand.
*  They're both, they're both going to have the ball a ton.
*  They're both going to run around.
*  Daniels has higher scramble potential and, um, both teams are going to score points.
*  Washington has a bad defense, so they're going to be getting the ball back six to one.
*  It hasn't moved either.
*  It hasn't moved for three weeks and I don't really fully understand it.
*  He's going to be dynamite to watch.
*  I just, I just get that.
*  And then I'll, I'll just throw this in there.
*  No one's going to like this.
*  Superbowl winner and MVP Detroit and DAC 200 to one.
*  Put me down for 50 grand.
*  Go ahead.
*  Your turn.
*  You know, I saw those bets and I have one coming later.
*  That's 200 to one.
*  Huh?
*  Yep.
*  Yeah.
*  Those are fun.
*  So basically.
*  They don't even have to correlate like that with the MVP and it doesn't mess up.
*  Chiefs, chiefs and Lamar Jackson.
*  Right.
*  I mean, it didn't matter.
*  Yeah.
*  All right.
*  We can start going fast.
*  So I got Denver over five and a half wins that I'm also going to put with New
*  England under four and a half and that's plus two 70.
*  I, there's been a lot of buzz on that Broncos line being like a win too low.
*  And I think we're all staring at it.
*  I, I just don't see Sean Payton going less than seven and 10.
*  Like he went eight and nine last year and we watched all those games.
*  I have no idea how that team went eight and nine.
*  There's going to be four games where he just out coaches somebody.
*  So over for that with the Pats.
*  That's plus two 70.
*  And then, uh, we haven't mentioned him yet.
*  Marvin Harrison, the rookie receiving yard title, which I guess he's competing
*  as neighbors and Michael Thomas and a doonsay plus one 50.
*  Why is that a plus in front of that?
*  Like Marvin Harrison's winning the rookie yards title.
*  If it doesn't get hurt.
*  So plus one 50 signed me up.
*  Sounds great.
*  Everybody loves that.
*  I took Keon Coleman at much higher odds because I just, these bills receivers are
*  going down and Josh Allen's going to have the year that I think he's going to have.
*  He's got to, got to get it to someone.
*  So, but yeah, that's probably the smart one.
*  Okay.
*  What do you got?
*  All right.
*  Uh, let me see what's left here.
*  Okay.
*  I'll go, um, am I going to have more futures left than you?
*  I know.
*  It's like tapping out.
*  It's like we're trying to get you to tap out.
*  I just have a lot of the same stuff.
*  Uh, Ravens to score a touchdown every game.
*  I gave it out on the RAFC pod.
*  You can redo it.
*  It's happened once in 93 games where they didn't score a touchdown.
*  One 93 games.
*  You have to go back to 2017, uh, December 22 against the Browns.
*  It's such a fluky thing.
*  So much talent.
*  Maybe there's bad luck in a rainy December game, but put me up for that one.
*  I'm sorry.
*  That's minus one 15 minus one 15.
*  So that's nice action.
*  Okay.
*  And this is one of those where you're watching it and it's like week 11 and
*  they're playing Cleveland and there's a fourth fourth down and goal goal line
*  stand, right?
*  There's a pick in the end zone.
*  They're inside the 10, three times.
*  They don't score.
*  They settle for field goals.
*  And you're like, Oh my God, this is a great game.
*  And then you're like, Oh, I'm going to go to the end zone.
*  Oh my God.
*  Right.
*  And I'm going to lose this.
*  I put a lot on it because, uh, because I have a problem, but also because I want
*  to be able to keep track of it.
*  I don't want some loser on Twitter to remind me, Oh, what happened to your
*  Raiders not scoring?
*  I'm like, Oh, fuck what?
*  Oh shit.
*  I forgot I had that.
*  So I'm gonna be fully invested in that.
*  Uh, I think I w we have some, well, you don't know like the Cowboys over
*  Cowboys over.
*  This is a bill South thing right there on Fandl over nine and a half Jaguars
*  over eight and a half plus two 30.
*  That's the bill.
*  So combo.
*  So, all right.
*  So you liked the Cowboys.
*  We're in.
*  All right.
*  Two to you or two to Luke.
*  I feel like you're going to tap out soon.
*  We should have called this the FOGO to child draft.
*  I'm still on green, buddy.
*  Green.
*  What was the time we went to FOGO with Brad and he wouldn't turn the co well,
*  one time I was with you, you've taken a bunch of times are crazy for him, Brad,
*  where he wouldn't turn the card over.
*  And then he just started moaning and he left.
*  And he went to the bathroom and wasn't seen for 25 minutes.
*  And it was a biohazard.
*  He sprinted to the bathroom.
*  We went a few weeks ago.
*  I had him at my house and he said he went to the bathroom and I was like the kids
*  up that I sent one of the kids to check on them because that's what you got to do.
*  And he said some guy was yelling at him in the bathroom.
*  He's like, dude, what's going on?
*  Are you all right?
*  Because he was doing just that.
*  He was moaning too much.
*  Don't moan too much in the stall.
*  It's going to, you're going to draw attention to yourself.
*  Yeah.
*  Don't moan in a public restaurant.
*  Moaning is usually there's no good scenario.
*  Either either it's a biohazard or somebody's having sex maybe with themselves.
*  Will you tell the other Brad stories since he just stayed with you?
*  Brad came over and he said he's on this some kind of I don't know if it's
*  medication or what, but he said his dreams are just wild now.
*  He's like, you wouldn't believe the adventures I'm going on.
*  Ran Randy just at the beach or whatever.
*  I'm in a car.
*  I'm flying off a cliff.
*  It's it's madness.
*  I was like, oh, well you got it.
*  Maybe change your medication.
*  Like, no, no, I like it.
*  Like really?
*  He's like, you know what helps it along cotton candy, but it's only a specific
*  kind of cotton candy.
*  So we had an after dinner go to CBS to get this cotton candy.
*  He gets three buckets full.
*  They luckily had it.
*  And then he just loads up on cotton candy and goes to sleep and like just has
*  night terrors like all through the night.
*  It's spectacular.
*  And your kids could hear her just screaming and yelling.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like fireworks, but it's like three in the morning and you don't know when
*  it's going to stop.
*  But the wife wasn't as big a fan.
*  I was entertained and so were the boys.
*  So there you go.
*  You should mention Brad's in his mid fifties.
*  Yes, he is.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, they're only mid fifties.
*  Yeah.
*  We should hope he gets the mid fifties.
*  Physically is in his mid one fifties.
*  Right.
*  I wouldn't count them in any of these futures.
*  That's for sure.
*  Two quick ones for me.
*  Seahawks playoffs is plus one 68.
*  And I like it more than they're over because if you're betting they're over.
*  Nine wins might make the playoffs in the NFC anyway.
*  And I get a lot more juice than that playoffs.
*  So plus one 60, I like that.
*  And then I mentioned the Lawrence 4,000 yards bet before you can just
*  bet that straight up.
*  It's plus one 50.
*  And that's just a, he has to get hurt for him not to hit that.
*  And I don't know why those odds aren't lower.
*  So I got those two back to you in the FOGA draft.
*  Who's tapping out.
*  All right.
*  Not yet.
*  Three, three AFC East playoff teams at six to one.
*  If anybody wants to shut me up about Aaron Rogers and the Jets, it's right
*  there for you because, you know, realistically six to one plus 600.
*  So Fandl has them right around 10 wins anyway.
*  So we'll, we'll check that box and let me give this, uh, it's mentioned.
*  Six to one seems high.
*  Like we, we did that windspot draft that we, we finally brought back and
*  all three of those teams were like in the first 12 picks disappeared.
*  Well, what'd you get for NFC West?
*  What were the odds for the same?
*  Yeah.
*  It was five 50.
*  All right.
*  Yeah.
*  But the NFC is weaker than the AFC.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  It's probably better bet.
*  Uh, and you mentioned Trevor Lawrence five or more touchdowns plus four 20.
*  He had five in 2022.
*  He had four last year and he sat out a game and a half.
*  He averages about 70 carries a year.
*  He takes it to goal line every now and again.
*  So if you get five or more touchdowns adjusted plus four 20 for Trevor Lawrence.
*  Jesus.
*  Should be, that seems really high.
*  Yeah.
*  Plus four 20.
*  Okay.
*  Um, I really liked this one.
*  I can't believe it's still on the board.
*  You had him earlier as the under, which I think was a smart bet.
*  Sam Darnold for passing yards.
*  Yeah.
*  I present to you the alternate scenario.
*  What if Sam Darnold plays all 17 games?
*  Is there a better bet on most interceptions because his odds are 10 to one on fan dual.
*  And I was looking at it.
*  I was studying the interceptions from the last few years at somewhere between like 15
*  and 19 is the range, but you figure with them, like they're playing Detroit twice.
*  They're playing green Bay twice.
*  Like Chicago's got a good secondary couple of outdoor games.
*  If he put him trying to squeeze in and adjusted Jefferson 10 to one seem pretty
*  tasty.
*  He has the track record too of bad decisions.
*  I like that.
*  All right.
*  So maybe we bet both.
*  Maybe we bet like, it's almost like a hedge against your other one, but we're
*  getting massive juice on both.
*  Yeah.
*  Like a million on the under passing yards and 300 grand on 10 to one for most
*  interceptions, one of them's got to hit.
*  I like that.
*  And then, um, we've mentioned them a couple of times, but, and this is the
*  sucker bed of the year.
*  I know everybody's taking it.
*  I can't believe I can still get it at 10 to one, but Jim Harbaugh to be coach of
*  the year is 10 to one.
*  All you have to do is read any of the articles.
*  Anyone is writing about the chargers the last two months and the interviews with
*  the players and how they they're just like talking about how the culture has
*  changed.
*  There's accountability now.
*  It's like every code word that I'm all in on in the preseason.
*  So you figure with basically no receivers, you would want to know fantasy draft
*  other than Josh Palmer with Baltimore's cast off running backs with Herbert on a
*  bad foot, although it seems like he's okay.
*  And then this defense that they're trying to rejuvenate and no home field advantage.
*  They're playing the Raiders and week one at home and there's be more Raider fans
*  there and him going nine and eight, 10 and seven.
*  I Mike McDonald would be the other one I was worried about, but 10 to one.
*  I love those ads.
*  So there you go.
*  This is the only thing I thought these guys are all around the same odds.
*  If Ibra Fluse, Harbaugh and Raheem Morris all win 10 games, who gets it?
*  Probably Harbaugh because they were five wins last year.
*  Right.
*  All right.
*  And then the NCAA takes it from him or he gets the key.
*  All right.
*  Let me give him a couple more.
*  Uh, I thought you would turn the card over.
*  No, I mean, I could always keep going.
*  Tyree killed plus seven 50 offensive player of the year.
*  We're always around week 14.
*  If he started, if he's still healthy, like, well, why, why are Tyree kill and
*  McCaffrey not in the conversation for MVP?
*  It's like, well, because.
*  You know, non-quarterbacks don't get MVP.
*  They just don't.
*  So I think of it's Hill or McCaffrey.
*  I know you have Justin Jefferson back this year, but we don't love Sam
*  Donald who's throwing him the ball.
*  So I really think it's between those two every year.
*  So gimme Hill plus seven 50.
*  I like it.
*  Offensive player of the year.
*  He just got voted best player in the league by his peers.
*  So he did.
*  Right.
*  Plus seven 50 seems.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, Oh, I might be out.
*  You're right.
*  I might be out.
*  You're tapping out.
*  Wait a minute.
*  Check.
*  Wait a minute.
*  Wait a minute.
*  This is great.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh crap.
*  Eagles, no playoffs.
*  Plus two 25.
*  Oh, you're scrambling now.
*  Now you're running off to the bathroom with Brad.
*  Lose to Brazil.
*  Yep.
*  In Brazil.
*  What, what are the ads on that?
*  Plus two 25.
*  All right.
*  Go ahead.
*  You, you win.
*  I'll, I'll tap for now.
*  I win.
*  I'm so excited.
*  Man.
*  I had a couple more that I really liked.
*  Go ahead.
*  Well, you go.
*  You mean you could finish.
*  Well, I'll do two more and then I'll do my runners up.
*  Yeah.
*  I had Murphy for defensive player of the year rookie at 11 to one.
*  He's the Seattle beast in the middle.
*  I have not, not read one thing about him that didn't seem like he was going to be
*  awesome.
*  Plus, you know how much I love the, I felt a 16 and I can remember the eight guys
*  who got taken in front of me.
*  Like he's one of those guys potentially good defense, good coach.
*  So I'm in on him.
*  And then my last one.
*  Oh, this is a fun one.
*  I have some other ones I like, but we can end on this one because you did this
*  version of this CJ Stroud to win the MVP and Detroit to win the super bowl.
*  110 to one.
*  Yeah.
*  So the Detroit part, we've already discussed that a million times CJ Stroud to
*  win MVP.
*  I think they'd have to be a one or a two seed.
*  They'd have to win 11 or 12 games.
*  I think he would have to throw for over 4,500 yards and have like 33 TDs, five
*  picks.
*  There's a case he was top five last year.
*  Yep.
*  So I just thought those odds were fantastic.
*  So those are my two.
*  You know what I'm going to do?
*  I'm going to do, why don't we do it this way?
*  Cause those odds are ridiculous.
*  You get over a hundred to one odds on any of these.
*  If we pick four teams and four players and just mix match them, I think we're in
*  it.
*  We're in it in the last couple of weeks of the season.
*  For sure.
*  Yeah.
*  If you like Detroit to win the super bowl, you might as well do four of the MVP
*  odds with them and try to, cause there's only four guys who have a chance to win
*  the MVP probably unless Josh Allen is awesome.
*  All right.
*  That the ones I left on the table, best record Detroit was 10 to one, uh,
*  Detroit over Houston in the super bowl.
*  It has to be exact.
*  That was 90 to one.
*  That's my super bowl pick the, uh, Detroit and Kansas city to be the one seeds.
*  26 to one.
*  Wow.
*  Wow.
*  What you want to take that one for the last pick?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Go ahead.
*  All right.
*  That's good.
*  I'm going to give that one to you.
*  26 to one.
*  Who else would you take to be the one seed in the AFC?
*  No, just in general.
*  If you were like, Hey, you bet your life, there will be two one seeds.
*  Who are you betting your life on?
*  I would bet on the trading Casey.
*  Yeah.
*  26 to one.
*  That would be it.
*  I mean, I like Buffalo a little more than JC, but I almost, I just think
*  they're going to beat them in the playoffs, but, um, TJ watt defensive
*  player of the year is plus 700.
*  If you're using that miles Garrett on Cleveland being on an awesome
*  defense where you're the best guy.
*  Sometimes that propels it up.
*  If Pittsburgh's these really good.
*  Stay healthy.
*  Yep.
*  Obviously.
*  And then a couple of two Niners.
*  If, if Niners season from hell is in play Niners under nine and a half wins
*  is plus two 60 and you could also go Seattle Rams, San Francisco, Arizona.
*  One, two, three, four exact 20 to one.
*  Seattle Rams.
*  So you're saying San Francisco is going to have a super disappointing year and
*  barely get into the playoffs at nine and nine and eight, something like that.
*  And fall behind the Rams and the, and Seattle wins the division 20 to one.
*  I thought that is what I do.
*  I do have a, I do have them second in that division, but that's not bad.
*  That's not bad.
*  I love them under 11 and a half too.
*  Well, that was it.
*  The first annual NFL futures draft presented by futures fusion and Fogo
*  to child who didn't even know they were going to be involved in the podcast.
*  We went, they had no idea what a win for them.
*  It's great.
*  You know what?
*  They need a win after Brad's visits.
*  So I think we feel like we owed Fogo to shout after what happened.
*  We're even now.
