# 'TNF' Eagles Vs. C-Words Reactions | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [November 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4)
*  Joe house is here his favorite team the Washington Seawards was seven and two a mere five days ago [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=0.0s)]
*  And it's now seven and four [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=7.76s)]
*  After two losses in five days. I listened to you on a very good show called East Coast bias on the ringer gambling show today [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=9.96s)]
*  And you were saying [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=16.84s)]
*  It felt a little early for Washington in a game like this [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  So make the same case you made 12 hours ago on that show [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=22.64s)]
*  well, I've had a couple drinks just to be a [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=26.52s)]
*  Blunt about it right from the top. So I'll be able to get half of it [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=30.04s)]
*  Right is it is it drunk house or just a slightly over served house buzzed house. Okay, yeah [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=33.56s)]
*  I'll say this this Washington team has now lost four games on the season [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  All of their losses are to playoff teams from last year [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=47.28s)]
*  None of none of their losses came to teams that they were forecasted to beat [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=50.72s)]
*  They have [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  Against their three toughest competitors all one score games [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=57.16s)]
*  so it's this whole season is a silver lining season and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  Washington just isn't quite good enough yet. They don't have good enough players [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=67.44s)]
*  They have good players and kudos to the front office and the coaching staff and everybody [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=71.52s)]
*  To put out the first competitive team that we've seen here in Washington now [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=77.0s)]
*  We did make the playoffs a handful of years ago with Ron Rivera with the team that finished under 500 [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=81.6s)]
*  I don't remember did make the playoffs in 2015 [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=86.88s)]
*  Did we bet against Ron Rivera when he made the playoffs with under 500 to we must have I mean it's lock of the century [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=90.08s)]
*  We had to have it. Yeah [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=96.11999999999999s)]
*  but you know for [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=98.8s)]
*  Two and a half three three and a half quarters Washington was in this game [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  Washington looked fine. We know he didn't win because your quarterbacks hurt [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=106.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's the other part of it. I said this on on the show [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=112.16s)]
*  One of my favorite bets for this evening was Jane Daniels under [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=116.12s)]
*  43 and a half rushing yards. He can't run right now because he's hurt. He's he's protecting his ribs [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=121.12s)]
*  The team's protecting him. The point isn't to win in week 11. The point is to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=126.72s)]
*  Win enough games to make it to the playoffs [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=132.4s)]
*  I think they need to win three more games the schedule sets up nice. We have a nice let's go through it [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=134.4s)]
*  Yeah, you're home Dallas home, Tennessee next to great favored by [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  Five five and a half against Dallas seven against Tennessee. You got a bye week [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=146.08s)]
*  At New Orleans home Philly home Atlanta at Dallas again, you get Dallas twice [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=152.28s)]
*  When it looks like they're punting on the season. It's wonderful. Couldn't be a better 11 wins anyway [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=158.84s)]
*  Yeah, and and I think in the NFC you get to Ted great chance of getting in there and this little mini by [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  Can't be overrated right they go from this Thursday night game, which I hate [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  I hate a divisional game on a Thursday night, but now they they have the the rest we're gonna get Marshawn [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=175.70000000000002s)]
*  Latimer we're gonna get you know, Jayden Daniels. Hopefully those eight days are meaningful to his recovery [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=182.12s)]
*  The offensive lines a little dinged up Cliff Kingsbury doesn't think so because he thinks that we should try these short yardage rushing plays [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  That the Eagles there were eight short yardage rushing plays. This is I'll just do my Kingsbury bit for ten seconds [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=197.54000000000002s)]
*  Eight eight short yardage rushing plays for Washington. They amassed a total of negative one rushing yards [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=203.8s)]
*  Is it second half cliff or do we have second half cliff in our lives? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=210.52s)]
*  Are you talking second half of the season or second half of a game or both all of the above all the above sadly [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=214.94s)]
*  so Clint if Cliff was a [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=221.82000000000002s)]
*  Baseball pitcher he'd be the I don't want to see the lineup a third time guy. I'm tapping my right arm [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=223.86s)]
*  I'm tapping you bring it to bring it in. Who's the situation? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=229.14000000000001s)]
*  Relief. Yes. Well, that was the key part of the game was when it was what second and one it felt like you need to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=232.78s)]
*  Or a game. I was sweating out and Eagles tease and an Eagles parlay [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=239.94s)]
*  Second one stuff third and one stuff. Let's go for it. I'm fourth and two fumbled handoff Daniels tackled three yards away from line of scrimmage and [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=244.98000000000002s)]
*  And that flipped the game I thought [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=254.14000000000001s)]
*  You know, and maybe I had some PTSD from last year with Jalen hurts, but I think it was the Giants last year [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=257.34000000000003s)]
*  I can't remember [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=263.38s)]
*  That with that game the Eagles murdered literally every tease on the planet [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=264.78000000000003s)]
*  when hurts through that last interception into like five guys and it was like [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=269.18s)]
*  oh [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=274.66s)]
*  I bet on the Eagles [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=275.54s)]
*  They're in the one game this year when Jalen hurts is just looks terrible and like he has seven injuries [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=277.94s)]
*  It felt like that today in the first half [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=282.58s)]
*  it felt like [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=285.38s)]
*  He doesn't look right [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=287.38s)]
*  What's going on here? Are they hiding an injury his body language gets weird? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=289.42s)]
*  You know, he starts getting a little hang doggish [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=294.82s)]
*  You start he's a little slow to get up after gets knocked down [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=298.38s)]
*  Your defense was flying around and I [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=302.1s)]
*  Felt like maybe you could steal like a 13 to 10 type game [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=305.02s)]
*  It was sitting there for a while and then say one Barkley took over and and that defense, you know, God God bless them [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=308.7s)]
*  It's all you know [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=315.78s)]
*  Retreads and guys that are you haven't established themselves? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=317.86s)]
*  With much in the way of pedigree yet. Frankie Louvoo is awesome. Bobby Wagner has pedigree [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=322.86s)]
*  Yeah, and there's like, you know like five or six guys who've established but you know, you still have st. Juice that on the corner [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=331.62s)]
*  The kid from Michigan now that looks like the steel of the draft Sandra still [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=338.78s)]
*  Incredible they went at him with both AJ Brown and [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=345.38s)]
*  Smith and he he was with the same route and he was there for both of them. So knock on wood [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=349.65999999999997s)]
*  I did it's a it's good. This is good team in progress. How did you feel about Dan Quinn's? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=355.46s)]
*  Arms up in the air. We're up by seven on a Thursday night game with a chance to blow every parlay and teaser [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=360.9s)]
*  double fist pump scream reactions like at least from [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=366.65999999999997s)]
*  From a character standpoint, he seems like he'd be a fun coach to have considering your last coach was basically [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=370.53999999999996s)]
*  Who is more dead him or Joe Biden in retrospect? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=376.58s)]
*  Respectfully Ron Rivera did just beat cancer [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=381.9s)]
*  For a Biden joke [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=390.26s)]
*  Now you have to get all serious on me [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=392.7s)]
*  We're way by it. We're way past the video Ron Rivera walking in the beach in Delaware like Biden or no [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=395.18s)]
*  Maybe maybe the two of them hand in hand together [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=402.42s)]
*  Notice Biden's wife didn't put her arm out [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=404.98s)]
*  She maybe maybe help the old man as he's trying to navigate some sand Jesus [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=407.53999999999996s)]
*  There is a lot of physical contact between those two ever since it became clear that he wasn't gonna run for president again [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=411.86s)]
*  You can't catch those two together in a single camera frame. Yeah, it's tough tough times. We'll see how it goes [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=418.74s)]
*  Okay, so big picture [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=425.18s)]
*  I would have said Philly was maybe my number one draft pick for the other NFC title spot against Detroit [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=429.09999999999997s)]
*  Something's missing and I don't know what it is now granted their kicker today [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=437.42s)]
*  They scored 26 points their kicker missed two field goals in the PAT. So really they could have been in the 30s [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=440.65999999999997s)]
*  but I [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=446.38s)]
*  Don't know what it is [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=447.74s)]
*  But they they have not won me over as the second team yet [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=448.94s)]
*  The problem is I don't know who the second team is like we could have the Green Bay conversation [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=452.58s)]
*  Maybe we'll know more this week. Maybe this is the week San Francisco gets going [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=456.94s)]
*  Maybe Minnesota will start looking again like they did in September go on and on but I just don't know who the team is [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=460.78000000000003s)]
*  I still think it's Philly and I think that they remain a work in progress [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=466.90000000000003s)]
*  Themselves you have to remember like this is and they made a point of it on the on the broadcast [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=472.74s)]
*  Alan Kirk, you know America's favorite Thursday night couple [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=478.94s)]
*  they [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=483.14s)]
*  You know Fangio's defense takes a little while for guys to get they have two [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=484.7s)]
*  Outstanding guys in that secondary Quinian Marshall and Dejean [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=490.06s)]
*  Yeah, and those guys are [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=494.58s)]
*  Are clearly, you know getting it Jalen Carter who had a dominant game tonight against the Washington offensive line [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=496.65999999999997s)]
*  That's been a revelation. So I think as they put it together [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=503.7s)]
*  Defensively ultimately they won that game with with with their defense, right? That's what we would say [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=507.82s)]
*  and I [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=513.02s)]
*  Mean, I haven't seen anything out of San Francisco [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=515.14s)]
*  San Francisco keeps trotting out the 30th ranked special teams [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=519.06s)]
*  Get the F out of here that what what they did last week isn't it worse than 30th [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=523.64s)]
*  It was 30th before all the shenanigans last week [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=528.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, there was a lot of dropped there was a lot of bad special teams. I mean that Lanna's kicker [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=531.4s)]
*  I'm gonna miss field goals, but in any event as you go down the list on the NFC side [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=536.48s)]
*  There's it's a lot easier to poke holes than express confidence [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=544.72s)]
*  I think on both sides of the ball the Eagles are are the second best [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=548.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it probably by default but I don't feel good about it, okay it is only week 11 remember where this is [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=555.4799999999999s)]
*  How many air teams would you take over the second NFC team? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=563.0799999999999s)]
*  I would Buffalo KC would you take both of them? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah for sure. Probably the Ravens [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=569.12s)]
*  I don't know the Ravens Ravens are close. Would you rather be the Chargers or the Eagles? Oh, definitely the Eagles [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=574.8399999999999s)]
*  No, no, no, come on. We're not there yet. The Chargers just just discovered that they have to two receivers [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=580.64s)]
*  We try to be the Steelers or the Eagles [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=586.5s)]
*  Eagles [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=591.0s)]
*  Those weapons on the outside [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=593.3599999999999s)]
*  I think I'd rather be the Steelers because the the Sirianni factor which did not rear its ugly head tonight [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=595.0799999999999s)]
*  Because maybe on Thursday nights is better [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=601.0999999999999s)]
*  But fair though your teams I'm guessing a playoff team still [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=605.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't see a scenario where that doesn't happen unless unless Daniels is really hurt. But even now you're seven and three [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=610.26s)]
*  Seven and four. I'm sorry set your seven and four [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=618.4399999999999s)]
*  You have a one game lead over Green Bay who's number three in the NFC North? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=622.3199999999999s)]
*  Nobody in the NFC South catching you and then the NFC West [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=627.92s)]
*  Arizona's six and four San Frans five and four and the Rams who we touted a couple weeks ago [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=632.04s)]
*  Who now are in a must-win spot against my guy Drake May and the Pats. Yeah [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=637.84s)]
*  So you're ten wins feels like it gets into the playoffs, right? I agree. Yeah [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=642.72s)]
*  I think it's ten wins in the NFC and I I liked our chances, you know [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=647.34s)]
*  I think I'm cautiously optimistic has this been a good season for [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=650.9599999999999s)]
*  Rehabilitating your Washington commander relationships in your life. I mean look I'm wearing the hat [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=655.88s)]
*  Text threads are you on how many separate watched and text threads are you on a half dozen? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=661.42s)]
*  At least and it's unbridled [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=666.98s)]
*  Exuberance like, you know, we have a football team where everybody's you know in my conversations [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=670.74s)]
*  It's around what the future might hold and everything begins with this quarterback. We must keep this kid [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=676.86s)]
*  healthy [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=683.5799999999999s)]
*  But if we have that foundational piece then it's been demonstrated [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=685.14s)]
*  Especially in his rookie year in his first 11 games in his rookie year [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=690.46s)]
*  He's showing that he belongs in the upper echelon [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=696.3s)]
*  You get that that you have a window and if you have a window you better jump through it in this modern NFL [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=698.86s)]
*  We have the next segment. I'm talking to Nate Tice about Drake May. It's the exact same situation [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=704.62s)]
*  yeah, we're like wow we now have I [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=709.62s)]
*  I even when this happened with Brady for the Pats and even in blood so in the 90s, but I [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=712.62s)]
*  Was way younger with having my my history of football knowledge and just how important a quarterback was you like? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=720.62s)]
*  Oh, we'll get a quarterback when you get older and you realize how rare it is and then you get one of these guys [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=727.0600000000001s)]
*  It's like the number one thing you'd want in any sport [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=732.82s)]
*  Well in it and in this iteration of the NFL this version because of the way the salary caps configured [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=735.8399999999999s)]
*  Getting the most important player on the team at the cheapest possible price and then trying to build around [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=742.24s)]
*  It's why I admired what Houston did in the offseason [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=749.04s)]
*  This most recent offseason and try in terms of trying to add just got aggressive [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=752.92s)]
*  You got to go you got to go the time is now if you have a quarterback like this [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=757.04s)]
*  So I expect Washington with Adam Peters [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=760.68s)]
*  It's like what what the Wizards are gonna do with Bob Carrington [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=763.44s)]
*  Same thing very simple now that you have your foundational piece. He's the guy now you got a bit and Jordan pool now [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=767.6s)]
*  You have that one to oh, yeah, you're the pool 42 points last night [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=774.4000000000001s)]
*  Why why do you have to say do it 42 points last night all he did you know what that man did? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=777.9200000000001s)]
*  Delivered a cover. You know the line was 10 and Washington lost by 9 [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=784.12s)]
*  Jesus I think we're in the heyday [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=789.1600000000001s)]
*  Baby it's a ball party. We're in the heyday of betting on huge underdogs [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=792.0s)]
*  In the NBA right now you notice that like the fucking [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=796.76s)]
*  What you've got Hawks were 16 point underdogs and just went into Boston and beat them [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=802.4s)]
*  I don't even there might not even been a money line in the game [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=807.24s)]
*  This three-point variance. It's like it's insane to lay that many points with any team [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=810.6s)]
*  All right anything else in this game? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=816.3399999999999s)]
*  Cuz we're gonna take a break and bring you back later for million dollar picks unless you have anything else no I'm pleased [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=817.76s)]
*  This is you know they they were competitive good happy. Let's move on. Let's get let's get to ten wins, okay? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuT-W-dtT4&t=823.24s)]
