# Million-Dollar Picks Week 10 With Joe House | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [November 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U)
*  All right. House is still here. We're going to do some million dollar picks. We went three and oh last week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=0.0s)]
*  We won $600,000. We're up to $778,000. There's about time some things went right and some things [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=3.6s)]
*  could go right last week. We were on the right side of the Rams, which you know, sweated that one out. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=9.52s)]
*  But I thought that was a good game. Cowboys and the over somehow hit last week against the Falcons. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=16.32s)]
*  And then 50-50. We hit an Eagles chief's tease that we had to sweat out on both ends. Although [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=23.44s)]
*  I will say I love sweating when I have Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid. I still feel like [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=29.36s)]
*  the sweat out was if Todd Bowles had gone for two, we were fucked. The tease was done. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=35.839999999999996s)]
*  The tease was done. No matter what happened with the two point, we're done. If he had just done the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  courageous thing that everybody would have celebrated him for, going for the win at the end of that game, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=46.4s)]
*  by going for a two pointer, it would have cooked every tease in America. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  It did lead to the coin toss video of Mahomes calling heads or whatever. The chiefs win and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=57.04s)]
*  Baker Mayfield kicks his head back because of course the chiefs are going to win. Of course, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=64.56s)]
*  on the biggest play of the game, the right tackle is going to take a step back two seconds before [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=68.32s)]
*  the snap starts. It's just great. It's great to bet on them because you know they're going to get [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  80% of the calls. Do you believe in Raheem, our guy Raheem? He has that A side, B side thing. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=78.08s)]
*  And the chiefs are the most A side NFL team we've had in a while. The Patriots got all the calls too. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=84.08s)]
*  They literally tried to railroad Tom Brady and suspended him for four games for the most dubious [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=90.48s)]
*  thing ever. The chiefs get more calls than any football team I can remember since the 70s Raiders. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  Nobody wants me to invite you to take another shit on the Lakers, but you just did this. You just [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=102.0s)]
*  talked about how many more free throws the Lakers have than any of course. They were shooting 10 [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=108.32s)]
*  more free throw attempts a game than the other team. A lot more physical. The Lakers. The low [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=113.27999999999999s)]
*  post Lakers. Speaking of physical, we're doing another tease. It feels, especially with the way [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  the favorites have been performing, it feels like a little safer on Tease Street. Still stopping at [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=129.04s)]
*  the flashing yellows, but I feel like I just can go straight now. There's no cops on Tease Street. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=136.24s)]
*  I could just cruise through and Heifetz in the previous segment mentioned the Eagles against [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=144.96s)]
*  the Cowboys with no deck. The Eagles are ninth in DBOA. Dallas is 25th. The Eagles have the second [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=150.72s)]
*  in the run, their offense. Dallas is 30th against the run. They're 29th yards per play. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  Lawrence is still out. Philly's defense is 50 yards per play. Fifth against first down, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=164.39999999999998s)]
*  fifth against the run, seventh against pass. They got Dallas got her back. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=169.67999999999998s)]
*  This line has kind of stayed at six and a half because people don't trust the Eagles. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=173.6s)]
*  With good reason. The reason for the tease is Sirianni insurance. We have to buy off [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=179.6s)]
*  all of the moronic things. It's Sirianni schmuck insurance. It is. It's Sirianni schmuck. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=186.0s)]
*  I can't say that 10 times fast. It's that. It's that. Because that dude is a stone cold schmuck. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=191.44s)]
*  So you got to have some way to get out of it. The Eagles teaser is a lock. You don't need to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=200.0s)]
*  convince me any further on that leg of it. Well, the best thing about this of Philly's now seven. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=206.64s)]
*  The best thing about this is you can get it to a number that Sirianni can't screw up with [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  a dumb two point conversion going for two when he's up, you know, 17 or all the weird shit he does. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=219.12s)]
*  So we can get them down to six and then I just to me, the Cowboys are, I said this to Sal and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  Sunday night, like I just feels like a five and 12, four and 13 team now. And I don't think, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=234.4s)]
*  I don't think there's any scenario for them to turn it around. I didn't think they were good [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=238.88s)]
*  to begin with. So that's one. And then the other one is Chargers Titans. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=242.64s)]
*  And I continue to think the Chargers are just severely undervalued and I'm mad we didn't take [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=248.88s)]
*  them last week against the Browns. We backed off. There was some couple of Chargers injuries. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=254.48s)]
*  Jamis was hot and it was a home game for Cleveland. There was good defensive stats. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=260.88s)]
*  I bet it in real life on Sunday, but I'm mad we didn't have four million dollar picks, but yeah. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=265.84s)]
*  House, did you know the Chargers have not given up 21 points yet this season? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=271.12s)]
*  I did know that. And you know, one big element of that and it'll feature in some of my plays on [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=275.12s)]
*  the Ringer pregame show on Sunday is they are so deliberate with the football. They use up on average [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=282.0s)]
*  like 31 seconds. They're number one in the league in terms of how much of the play clock they use. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=290.0s)]
*  So they control the flow of the game, which definitely contributes to that. It's a very good [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=297.2s)]
*  defense. Again, I couldn't name six players on it, but that doesn't matter. It's institutional. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=304.24s)]
*  It's Harbaugh and the guy that he brought over from Michigan and they just play disciplined [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=311.44s)]
*  football. So I mean, this is the seven and a half down to one and a half against a Titans team where [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=315.92s)]
*  it seems like Will Levis is going to play. Is that wonderful? Please, please. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=324.08s)]
*  They've been crushing teams with bad QBs this year. Points they've given up 10, 3, 20, 17, 16, 15, 8, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=330.15999999999997s)]
*  and 10. And if you're going to make a case for Tennessee, it would probably start with their [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=338.24s)]
*  defense is pretty good. Yeah, it is. The good defensive stats. So that I watched them last week. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=341.91999999999996s)]
*  I thought they did a pretty good job with the Pats. They are first on first downs, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=347.28s)]
*  first against the past, second against on third down. The Chargers need some of the stats are [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=353.28s)]
*  just phenomenal. I mean, they're, they're in the top five and just about every relevant category. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=358.47999999999996s)]
*  They're anything. It's a run. I really like this Chargers team. And I think they're a little better [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=363.91999999999996s)]
*  than the good bad team because they have confidence now they're physical, they're getting some guys [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=369.28s)]
*  back and their receivers have gotten better week after week after week. And you watch them and it's [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  like Johnson, Josh Palmer, McConkey. Like they have guys that can actually get first down to move [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=380.0s)]
*  the chains. Well, you know, what's happening in over that same time continuum week after week [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=386.16s)]
*  after week, Justin Herbert got healthy. He, I think, I think he really was hurt. I mean, he, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=391.84s)]
*  he sat out chunks of games. Did he miss a full game? I don't remember early in the season and [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=397.36s)]
*  his mobility is back and they are taking downfield shots and you know, kudos to Quentin Johnson for [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=402.64s)]
*  getting it together. They took him in a WR one position, first round of the draft position. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=408.64s)]
*  Good for him that it looks like it may yet pay off. I mean, he wasn't even drafted [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=416.0s)]
*  in fantasy. Yeah. Why would he be? He wasn't drafted. He was, he was a first round pick in [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=423.12s)]
*  his second year and people were like, the Chargers have no receivers and I still wouldn't draft this [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=428.96s)]
*  guy. It felt like he was 50 50 to get cut. That's how bad his rookie season was. Yeah. They, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=433.44s)]
*  they rejuvenated him. So I think Eagles Chargers is about as good as I've felt about a tease in a [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=440.96s)]
*  while. I love it so much. I really do. I, I, I fear my only fear with the Eagles is they have your [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=448.32s)]
*  Washington C words on Thursday. Yeah. And we've learned over the years, the game before the game [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=454.8s)]
*  is always a little hairy when you have that big game coming. So that's the only thing I'm worried [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=461.12s)]
*  about at all. It's a, it's a great observation. The other leg that, that to me got better is the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=466.16s)]
*  chiefs at home against Denver, where that line was in the eight and a half nine range. And now it's [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=472.96s)]
*  down to seven and a half because people are giving so much respect to Sean Payton. I'm not saying that [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=478.16s)]
*  we necessarily should do anything with it here on million dollar picks, but am I going to play a [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=484.0s)]
*  three-leg tease featuring those three teams come Sunday? Yes, I am. I looked at that too. And I [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=489.04s)]
*  thought, even though the Broncos got killed last week, I still feel like they were in that game [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=495.6s)]
*  for an hour and a half. And that the first half touchdown just killed it. Once they fell behind [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=500.8s)]
*  14 against Eric Henry and Lamar, it's done. It was 17 10. I felt like they had more of a chance. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=505.28000000000003s)]
*  Something scares me about that game and I can't explain it. Okay. Fair enough. No, I'm just saying [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=511.52000000000004s)]
*  like, I I'm with you on Sunday. I'll probably, that would be a three team tease instead of a two [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=516.56s)]
*  team tease, but I built the Broncos. Haven't they played the chiefs well the last couple of years? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=521.04s)]
*  Not really. Well, there, there, there might be some moments of close games, but the chiefs [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=528.3199999999999s)]
*  owned the Broncos. Yeah. So they, they split with them last year. They beat them in week eight, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=533.28s)]
*  24 to nine. I think that was one of the 12 times in my home's his career. I've been like, what's [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=538.8s)]
*  wrong with the chiefs? And then, Hey, guess what? They're fine. I'm staying away from that one. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=543.6s)]
*  Here's one that I don't want to stay away from unless you talk me out of it. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=548.32s)]
*  The new coach theory is back. The saints have a new coach. They are plus three and a half against [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=552.8000000000001s)]
*  the Falcons this week. And in their first meeting, they lost at the buzzer by two. Falcons are banged [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=559.9200000000001s)]
*  up. London's hurt. Might play, might not. Pits is hurt. Might play, might not. Lindstrom's hurt. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=568.0s)]
*  Jarrett's hurt. He's old, but he's out. I like that they already played in the saints, move the [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=574.0s)]
*  ball on them. The Atlanta's defense is the worst in the league completion percentage, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=580.0s)]
*  which is kind of ties in. So they have no pass rush. They're not good at stopping completion, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=586.0s)]
*  which are really the only good things the saints are good at. Now they traded Latimore, which makes [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=591.28s)]
*  me nervous because that, that means that's a, they're quitting on the season. The saints, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=597.6s)]
*  their defense is 31st. That was with Latimore and yards per play. Atlanta's seventh. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=602.24s)]
*  I don't know. Do we believe in the new coach theory? It didn't work with the Jets because the [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=609.52s)]
*  Jets ended up not, they lost by three to the Bills and did not cover in a game that we both bet on. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=613.6800000000001s)]
*  So you could say the new coach theory is new or maybe don't do it with the saints, but I was, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=619.6800000000001s)]
*  I was taken aback by the dialogue from the saints side about it really seemed like they were delighted [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=624.64s)]
*  that Dennis Allen got fired. Well, I do think that they're delighted that Dennis Allen got [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=630.48s)]
*  fired, but I will confess, I am very gun shy when it comes to the saints team. I personally feel [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=635.9200000000001s)]
*  like I had a hand in getting Dennis Allen fired because I bet on the saints against the Panthers. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=641.04s)]
*  It was my wise way to all I asked them to do was score 14 points in the first half against the [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=648.48s)]
*  Panthers. They scored exactly 13 points. They lost by, they had a chance to go for two after, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=653.92s)]
*  after scoring a touchdown where it would have made sense for them to go for two and get to 14. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=659.52s)]
*  But I cannot, after watching their car, I, I'm going to have to try and figure out how to say [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=664.9599999999999s)]
*  this politely. What he did to Chris Olave. Cash bar, cash bar car. What, what, what like the Michael [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=672.24s)]
*  Thomas respond. I worry like, is that, do they believe that in that locker room? Does Michael [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=678.8s)]
*  Thomas still have sway? I'm taking them off. We can't do it. Well, Derek Hart might, might shorten [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=686.24s)]
*  that guy's career. He might be responsible for Chris Olave only playing five years. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=692.4799999999999s)]
*  Well, that pass was, that's the most dangerous pass you can throw in football. I don't think [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=698.9599999999999s)]
*  he did it intentionally. I just don't think he's that good at football. The worse the quarterback [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=702.7199999999999s)]
*  is, the more the ball sales. It's something that Brady, you know, it's the one thing he'll get mad [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=706.48s)]
*  at as an announcer when the quarterback leads somebody into a collision. Cause he feels like [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=711.6800000000001s)]
*  that's your job not to do that. Right. Exactly. So I'm, I'm, I'm, they just scare me. That's fine. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=716.16s)]
*  How about the Steelers plus three against your Washington Seawords? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=725.6s)]
*  So I think it's a 50 50 game because you're going to go through and look at, um, the Steelers defense [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=729.12s)]
*  and it will be true that they have a bunch of very good numbers. And then if you consider who [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=736.72s)]
*  they've played, they really haven't gone up against, uh, any offenses with genuine firepower yet. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=741.92s)]
*  So can I give you the converse on that? Yes. I don't think I use that. No, you're, you're right. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=750.0s)]
*  Washington beat the giants twice. They beat Cleveland, Carolina, Chicago, Cincinnati, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=755.6s)]
*  and Arizona. This is the first top 10 DVOA defense that they've played. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=760.24s)]
*  Only played two in the top 16 of the league. You're right. Number 11, Chicago, they scored 18. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=765.7600000000001s)]
*  Number 13, Baltimore, they scored 23. And it's very possible your team is seven and four in a week. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=771.0400000000001s)]
*  Cause you got that Philly game on Thursday and it's like, guess what? They're going to be [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=779.5200000000001s)]
*  a Philly game on Thursday and it's like, guess what? You would have taken seven and four, but [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=783.36s)]
*  this is a different part of the schedule than they've had to deal with the whole season. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=787.6s)]
*  A thousand percent true. And part of the calculus for why you would feel comfortable enough taking [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=791.6800000000001s)]
*  the Steelers is just Tomlin as an underdog on the road against a rookie quarterback. There are all [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=797.6s)]
*  these numbers you can look at over the span of that man's 20 year career, where he eats up [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=806.16s)]
*  situations like this. And he will certainly have that defense mindset wise. Like guys, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=811.2s)]
*  everybody's looking to see this rookie quarterback against you. You here's your opportunity to shine. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=818.1600000000001s)]
*  So that would be the reason. I personally think- [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=824.1600000000001s)]
*  Well, there's another reason though that the running backs are healthy and it feels like [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=826.5600000000001s)]
*  they can actually run the ball on Washington. Now you like this Washington defense though. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=830.6400000000001s)]
*  Well, I like this Washington defense against Russell Wilson because the Washington defense [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=835.36s)]
*  over the past month has gotten very successful marks in terms of pass, rush, win, rate, and they [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=839.68s)]
*  put pressure. They've been very successful in putting good disruptive pressure on quarterbacks [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=848.0s)]
*  and the Steelers offensive line had been rotating chairs, rotating casts a little bit. I'm not sure [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=854.2399999999999s)]
*  if that's settled down, but if Russell Wilson is in any duress at all, then I like Washington's [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=860.3199999999999s)]
*  chances there. To me, it feels like a turnover or field goal game. It's a game where- [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=867.68s)]
*  So what's six numbers plus three? That sounds great. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=873.4399999999999s)]
*  That's- it's totally fine. I'm not talking you out of it. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=875.5999999999999s)]
*  Card's Jets. This is the lion of the year. The Cardinals are underdogs at home against the Jets. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=880.7199999999999s)]
*  I've watched football every week this season. The Cardinals are better than the Jets and yet [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=888.7199999999999s)]
*  they're on my do not bet list because I don't trust them. I don't know why I don't trust them. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=892.88s)]
*  They're five and four and they've gotten better, not worse as the seasons went along. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=897.44s)]
*  The Jets lost to the Patriots played on a Thursday night against Houston that basically had one [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=901.6800000000001s)]
*  receiver in camp block and it felt like the Jets were going to lose until this crazy Garrett Wilson [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=906.72s)]
*  catch that I still don't understand how it was a touchdown. The game flips, the Jets win, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=913.6s)]
*  and it's Halloween. It's stupid. It's a Thursday night and now people are like, oh, the Jets are [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=919.36s)]
*  back. I don't think the Jets are good. I don't think the Jets are good either, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=923.76s)]
*  but- and again, to be clear, the Jets are on my do not. I have two teams on my- I will not [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=929.52s)]
*  bet on either of these teams. The Jets are the Bears. There's no scenario in which you're going [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=935.04s)]
*  to be able to- I don't care what the numbers are, what they say. I'm just not betting on those teams. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=939.12s)]
*  I would have thrown the Jaguars on there as well. Well, that's fine. They all have the same thing [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=943.28s)]
*  in common, which is Dunderhead, nincompoop decision makers out there guiding the schemes. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=948.0s)]
*  I want no part of the Jets' offensive scheme. Think about all the conversation that we just had [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=954.56s)]
*  with Danny Hyphets and what Nathaniel Hackett did to Breece Hall this season. The number one pick [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=961.92s)]
*  in fantasy can't get off because the Jets can't get off. They spent all this money on trying to [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=968.16s)]
*  rehabilitate an offensive line. So to me, this Arizona Jets game, just- we don't have to bet [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=975.12s)]
*  on every game. We don't have to bet on that game. I would say let's not do anything with that game. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=981.04s)]
*  Counter. So Arizona's won four of their last fives. They beat San Francisco really nice [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=986.96s)]
*  when I watched it. They got killed by Green Bay. They snuck out that Chargers game that I don't [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=995.04s)]
*  know how they won. I think the Chargers are good. They went against a good defense, beat them. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1000.8000000000001s)]
*  They came back and beat that Miami team. Little resilience there. And then they kind of killed [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1004.8000000000001s)]
*  Chicago last week. Swamped them. I mean, they really gave them problems. And I think what I [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1010.0s)]
*  liked about that game going into this game is Chicago has a shitty offensive line, right? And [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1016.48s)]
*  they just- they were in Caleb's grill the whole time. The Jets' offensive line is a mess. I mean, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1021.6800000000001s)]
*  they're not even sure who's playing this weekend. And Rogers has looked old. And I just like it. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1026.8s)]
*  So I want to do it. I know I'm taking them off the DMV list. Well, look, make it the argue pick. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1034.0s)]
*  I would say don't bet it. And you're going to bet it. I won't take the Jets. I won't take the [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1042.24s)]
*  other side of it. So it's not the argue pick in that respect. Before Drake May got hurt in that [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1048.0s)]
*  Jets game, he was just kind of scrambling around and doing whatever. And the Jets didn't seem- [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1051.36s)]
*  he seemed faster than the Jets, which makes me think Kyla Murray against that Jets defense. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1057.68s)]
*  I just feel like he'll be able to move around and do things. And what- this Jets team, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1062.48s)]
*  I don't understand why we haven't written them off yet. I don't get the line. It's insulting. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1067.68s)]
*  Do you think it's a rat line? No, I think it's the right line. It's a line based on priors. I [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1072.96s)]
*  didn't get a chance to sit down and look at the look ahead. But here's the part of what would help [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1079.52s)]
*  your case going against the Jets. CJ Mosley, questionable. The cornerback, Michael Carter. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1085.44s)]
*  Questionable. Two safeties, both of their safeties. Questionable. If they're not in [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1091.6s)]
*  perfect health, that defense, we've seen that defense be super gettable to the Jets. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1096.7199999999998s)]
*  I'm taking cards plus one and a half. The Rams are playing the Dolphins. And my first instinct was [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1100.6399999999999s)]
*  jump on the Rams. And I thought a lot about the Dolphins the last couple of weeks. I watched that [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1111.1999999999998s)]
*  whole Dolphins-Bills game. I thought they played really well. They did. Their defense isn't very [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1115.84s)]
*  good, but they can run the ball and control the ball and move the ball. And they're hard to play. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1120.48s)]
*  And this Rams team, they were super lucky last week. If you're a Seattle fan, that was one of [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1125.92s)]
*  the worst losses of the year. You're just saying, how the fuck did we lose that game? Three possessions [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1134.64s)]
*  in the red zone in the second half, one of which turned into six points for the other team. Not [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1139.2s)]
*  only did they, they didn't go scoreless in the red zone, they gave six points in the other direction. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1146.24s)]
*  And I think the Dolphins can run the ball in them. So I'm wondering, and you kind of like them too, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1152.08s)]
*  I'm wondering, do we take the plus one and a half? Do we do an adjusted line with the over? What do [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1159.76s)]
*  we do? In the first place, Dolphins money line would be attractive to me. And then if you wanted [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1164.88s)]
*  to do like do an adjusted line where it's Dolphins minus two or something like that. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1172.24s)]
*  The important thing to me, and as we handicap this is for sure what you just sort of outlined, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1178.0s)]
*  which is the Dolphins have been unlucky and they are such a different team with Tua, but they're [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1182.8s)]
*  barely lost Arizona. They barely lost Indianapolis. And last week they really could have [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1191.1200000000001s)]
*  beaten Buffalo. And I thought they really played well. I was so mad about that Indianapolis loss. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1195.6s)]
*  They had that game in hand. Zach Seiler's back. That's the key aspect of this to me. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1200.16s)]
*  Their ability to generate some pressure against the Rams and against Matthew Stafford, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1208.24s)]
*  it really is dependent on Seiler being there and he is. So that's a key element to me. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1214.48s)]
*  Do you see points in this game? Yes. Yes, I do. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1221.0400000000002s)]
*  What if I was able to offer you the Dolphins plus four and a half with the over of 42 and a half at [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1225.2s)]
*  minus one 15. Wow. That's just like a standard. I love that. I love that price. It's the Dolphins [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1230.8s)]
*  plus four and a half. Dolphins plus four and a half and over 42 and a half. Yeah. Yeah. In. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1238.32s)]
*  That's a great one. Great job. Thanks. All right. We're right now and down Dolphins four and a half. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1246.24s)]
*  I'll tell you another thing. And we say this sometimes at the Rams, depending on who's coming [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1255.6000000000001s)]
*  in. The Dolphins have a lot of fans, man. And I think there's going to be Dolphin fans. That's [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1262.72s)]
*  a team that's been around since the seventies. They have generations of fans. Some of them live [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1269.6000000000001s)]
*  in LA. I know some of them. I think there's going to be Dolphin fans in that game. It is funny to [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1274.0s)]
*  think about people from Miami flying to Los Angeles. It's not, you know, it's not like a [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1281.44s)]
*  destination for them. All right. Last one I have for you is the Lions. We're a little afraid of [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1286.64s)]
*  Nico Collins, right? Cause it seems like he might come back for Houston, might not. And I looked at [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1294.24s)]
*  this initially like, Oh, no, Nico Collins, no digs. Like the Lions are going to absolutely kill them. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1300.48s)]
*  It's in a dome. I think this Lions team is, is great. So there, there's a couple of things we [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1306.96s)]
*  can do with this. You do the Lions money with the under 57 and a half. That's minus one 11. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1312.08s)]
*  So basically like anything, any score higher than 30, 27 beats it. The Lions are favored by three [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1317.92s)]
*  and a half in this and something scares me about the hook. And I just wonder, maybe you just take [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1324.24s)]
*  lay the points. Maybe the Lions are that good. Maybe we've hit a point and just bet the Lions [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1328.32s)]
*  every week. Well, they are 40 and 15 against the spread over the last 55 games. So that's pretty [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1332.8s)]
*  good evidence. You're, you're, you're going to make money gambling on the, on the lions. I [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1339.52s)]
*  can only come up with, you know, I don't have any [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1348.0s)]
*  um, X's and O's reason to not do it. It is the case for sure that CJ Stroud over his short career [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1353.68s)]
*  thus far has dramatically better splits at home than on the road. It is the case that Houston's [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1363.1200000000001s)]
*  defense has been very good on early downs. And the Lions are sort of middle of the pack on, on early [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1371.0400000000002s)]
*  downs. Uh, I, you know, you, there isn't a lot to do. I think it's just, you know, I like that Detroit [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1378.72s)]
*  Moneyline better than mess around with the points. So Detroit Moneyline is minus one 84. I was looking [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1387.04s)]
*  at the Detroit wins the first half Detroit wins the game, but they don't have that on Findle right [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1394.56s)]
*  now because I think something goofy with, uh, with the Collins. Oh, there it is. No, they do have it [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1399.84s)]
*  now. So that's plus one Oh five Detroit first half the trick game. What are your thoughts? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1405.6s)]
*  Plus one Oh five. Yeah, I think I like it. I kind of like the plus money. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1420.0s)]
*  We're just asking them to win the, yeah. Yeah. Because, uh, we're in on that one. Yeah. Here's [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1425.84s)]
*  a couple of things with the, uh, with the lions, um, seventh against the run on defense. I think [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1432.56s)]
*  the only way that Texans win this game is they run the ball. They do the Joe mix and thing, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1442.1599999999999s)]
*  but I feel like the lions can shut that down. The other thing is the lions are first and [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1447.28s)]
*  quarterback Curry's guess who's 32nd offensively Houston. Yeah. Their line sucks. Like even the [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1451.36s)]
*  jets were getting a Stroud. I just feel like the lions can overrun them. Lions are first in DVOA. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1458.4s)]
*  They've only scored 23 points once since week two, the Texans. I don't think they're going to score [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1464.24s)]
*  points. Well, and I'm looking, um, I messed up the number. Um, the lions are awesome on early downs [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1469.0400000000002s)]
*  and so is the Houston defense. So that, that those two are neutralize each other, but will [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1475.2s)]
*  Anderson might be hurt? And here's the thing that I'm reminded of. I got hurt last week. That's [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1479.44s)]
*  right. Yeah. Yeah. I'm here's the thing that tips it. Zedaria Smith. Do you think that he will be [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1483.68s)]
*  fired up to come in and make a great first impression and put pressure on CJ Stroud in [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1488.72s)]
*  this, in this game? They there it's, it's a, it's an Island game, right? And Detroit will want to [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1494.0s)]
*  come out. Yeah. Let's do that, man. Whatever you want to do with Detroit. I'm there. Lions first [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1499.2s)]
*  half lions game plus one. Great. We're doing it. Great. Great. Okay. Last but not least, what do [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1503.04s)]
*  you want to do with this giants blowout Panthers game in Germany? There's so much fun to root for. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1508.56s)]
*  It'll be fun if they go up like 20 to three. I don't want to do it. I want to sleep. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1514.0s)]
*  I want you, you're leaving out the blowout that I liked the best this week. What is it? I like [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1518.96s)]
*  another blowout better. What is it? San Francisco 49ers going into Tampa off of a bye week where [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1523.6799999999998s)]
*  Todd Bowles as a head coach is Oh and six going up against teams. This is the week where the injuries [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1530.72s)]
*  for Tampa finally catch up. It's a very, very tough spot for them coming off of that Monday night. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1537.36s)]
*  And it seems like we keep saying it. Everybody keeps saying it. McCaffrey is going to be back [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1544.3999999999999s)]
*  and it came at exactly the right time. We were not that far off this position last year with the [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1549.6s)]
*  record for San Francisco going into their buy right around kind of 500 ish. They came out and they [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1557.9199999999998s)]
*  beat the crap out of the Jacksonville Jag. I think they won like 34 to three. I tried to look it up [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1564.16s)]
*  earlier. They blew the doors off and and Brock Purdy's nuts is absolutely. He did that. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1570.88s)]
*  Her these nuts with this time with Shanahan's ability to scheme and what they just watched [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1581.28s)]
*  Kansas City be able to do. I think I'm going to be able to take advantage of all of it. I really [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1589.52s)]
*  absolutely thrilled to lay the points. Anything under a touchdown for me with the Niners. This [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1594.24s)]
*  is the portion of the season where the Niners get going. We're all like, Oh, this is why we had them [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1600.3200000000002s)]
*  at the top of the NFC. Here's the version of that team. I love I love this spot against Tampa this [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1604.4s)]
*  week. The Tampa defensive stats are absolutely abysmal. Offenses are there. First of all, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1610.96s)]
*  they're 31st and first downs 30th and passing yards, 24 yards per play. Then you flip it the [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1620.56s)]
*  other way. The Niners have some really good defensive stats that I was surprised by. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1627.04s)]
*  Like they're fifth against the pass. They're second and first downs, things like that. So [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1632.3999999999999s)]
*  I like your blowout call. So now I'm wondering like how much of a blowout are we thinking? [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1636.72s)]
*  Would you go 14 plus? Would you go 17 plus? I like the 14 plus is in my is my in my neck of the woods [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1642.6399999999999s)]
*  because you know, Baker is scrappy. Baker's been working. I'm so impressed by Baker. He's him and [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1650.8799999999999s)]
*  Kate Otten are good for something. I really my tip I had to Baker this season. You sound like [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1656.6399999999999s)]
*  Collinsworth. I just realized it. I just I just love this Baker Mayfield. He's he's really he's [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1663.2s)]
*  such a gamer. He's so dumb. All right. So we'll do how about this? Oh my God. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1669.68s)]
*  Keep your pants on for this one. Niners win by 14 plus. Giants win by 14 plus. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1680.72s)]
*  On FanDuel it is over 10 to 1. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1689.68s)]
*  Well, for the record, I'm going to split those two up in my own betting card. And if we're going to [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1692.08s)]
*  put those two together, it can't be for very much money. It has to be. Could that be a 20k bet at 10 [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1701.6799999999998s)]
*  to 1 odds? Great. Or we just go separately on both of them, put 100k on each and hope both of them hit. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1709.04s)]
*  Let's do why don't we do both 20k on the combo combo platter. And what would you say on each [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1715.28s)]
*  individually 100k on each? Niners 100k on Niners plus 230 100k on Giants plus 240. I like doing [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1724.0s)]
*  that more and forgetting the parlay. OK, OK. That's fine. I like it. All right. Only other [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1731.2s)]
*  game I wanted to mention and we're staying away from it is the Jaguars against the Vikings with [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1735.92s)]
*  Mack Jones. So you can go to we're not betting this, but you know two ways with this. One is [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1742.8s)]
*  this is yet another chance to bet against Mack Jones with a great defense that we know Mack Jones [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1750.0s)]
*  when you're pressuring him. It's a disaster. The other way to think of it is is there some [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1755.6s)]
*  newing theory possibilities with Mack Jones this week with the money line? Oh, is Trevor Lawrence [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1760.24s)]
*  even good? Like we still don't know what if Mack Jones comes in and he's good and he actually [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1766.48s)]
*  beats the Vikings. It is funny. This is going to happen. I want to talk about. Let's do it. Let's [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1770.72s)]
*  take now. We're not doing it. We're not doing it. 5k. No, we're doing nothing. I'm going to bet [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1775.1200000000001s)]
*  five dollars. I'm telling everybody right now I'm betting five dollars on Jacksonville to win this [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1780.96s)]
*  week because that is one of the funniest outcomes of the week. I'm definitely doing it. They are [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1785.84s)]
*  plus 265 to win out. Fine. Fine. You could do that. Mack Jones. You could do the over with the money [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1790.32s)]
*  line and that would be plus 568 to the Mac. Mac lights up Minnesota. That's a deep fried [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1799.84s)]
*  turkey. That's a that's a that's my deep fried turkey special of the week. All right. Here we go. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1807.4399999999998s)]
*  It's time. The million dollar picks for week 10. Last week we won six hundred thousand dollars. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1814.0s)]
*  We're up 770 for the season. Joe House and I are hot. House is going to celebrate these picks with [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1818.8799999999999s)]
*  an Arby deep fried turkey sandwich. They're not a sponsor for million dollar picks. We just love [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1825.04s)]
*  Arby's first tease the Philadelphia Eagles up to seven against the Dallas Cowboys who stink, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1830.08s)]
*  who don't have that Prescott, who are headed for four and 13 or five and 12. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1838.48s)]
*  Kind of like this Eagles team to there's some great stats of them teasing them with the Chargers minus [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1842.72s)]
*  seven and a half against Will Levis and the Titans. We think it's going to be Will Levis, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1849.12s)]
*  but the Chargers have not given up 21 points yet this season. They have crushed teams with bad QBs. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1854.24s)]
*  All of these bets are going to be 200K. We're putting 200K on that. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1859.92s)]
*  House and I really like the Dolphins against the Rams. Even though I've been on the Rams all year, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1864.16s)]
*  I just the Dolphins can run the ball. They've been super frisky the last three weeks. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1869.1200000000001s)]
*  We're doing an adjusted one. Dolphins plus four and a half with the over 42 and a half in L.A. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1873.76s)]
*  Bunch of Dolphins fans there. You think the Dolphins could win this game outright? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1880.0s)]
*  I do. I do. I think that they're what we saw that offense against Buffalo was very promising. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1884.56s)]
*  I like them very much in this situation. We bought ourselves some schmuck insurance [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1891.04s)]
*  there because of the possibility of the Dolphins and Dishakie McDaniel controlling the whole game. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1895.44s)]
*  And then in the last six minutes, all of a sudden getting skittish and then their Stafford going [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1904.4s)]
*  down the field and all of a sudden they lose by three. So we have schmuck insurance with the [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1909.12s)]
*  Dolphins plus four and a half over 42.5 parlay. Next one, Steelers plus three in Washington against [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1912.3999999999999s)]
*  House of C-Words. We just think this is a three point game. We're grabbing the points. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1920.6399999999999s)]
*  No harm done. That's it. That's it. Washington has not played a top 10 DVOA defense yet. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1924.7199999999998s)]
*  And we like the spot for the Steelers. I'll tell you what, I'm not rooting against [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1929.1999999999998s)]
*  Washington, but the bet makes sense. Three point. That makes sense. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1932.4799999999998s)]
*  Next one we disagreed on and we're doing it anyway. And then we can argue about it. If [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1936.56s)]
*  it doesn't work out the Cardinals at home getting one and a half points against the stupid jets. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1941.28s)]
*  And this I'm just offended by this line and I'm taking the Cardinals. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1947.92s)]
*  It's the second funniest outcome of the week. Roger's losing to the Cardinals would be tremendous. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1952.08s)]
*  So I that what I will root for. I just can't in good conscience recommend anybody bet on it. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1956.48s)]
*  I don't think the jets are good. Lion's first half, Lion's game in Houston is plus one oh five. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1962.16s)]
*  Both of them have to hit. And we are now at the point of the season where we're just riding the [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1971.8400000000001s)]
*  Lions. We believe in the Lions. I'm not sure when they lose again. And if they lose, it's going to [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1975.76s)]
*  be against a team that's better than Houston. Houston's offensive line can just not carry them [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1979.68s)]
*  in this game. And I don't think they're going to run the ball in Detroit either. You love the [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1984.3200000000002s)]
*  Lions safest bet for you right now in the league? Yes. I mean, the math supports it. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1988.32s)]
*  Their performance supports it. The additional Nazarian Smith supports it. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1993.9199999999998s)]
*  Their coaching staff supports it. I mean, I tried to speak into existence, the Packers being [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=1997.28s)]
*  competitive. That game was over with a quickness because Jordan Love couldn't move. So and Jared [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=2002.6399999999999s)]
*  Goff had two gloves on and it was perfectly fine. He did. The ball didn't slip one time. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=2009.9199999999998s)]
*  And then last but not least, we're putting a hundred K on the Niners minus thirteen and a [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=2016.64s)]
*  half adjusted. That's plus two thirty because we think Tampa, no disrespect to Tampa, it's been an [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=2023.1200000000001s)]
*  impressive season, but from a talent injuries, you just you're not going to be able to hang in [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=2030.0800000000002s)]
*  short. We don't think. And then the Giants in Germany against the Panthers, who there's no way [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=2035.44s)]
*  they're winning twice in a row, minus thirteen, a plus two forty. We're going to put a hundred K [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=2040.88s)]
*  in each of those and try to hit one and hopefully both be awesome. I'll have a Christmas sale for [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=2045.0400000000002s)]
*  it. And you put 10 K in the parlay at plus 10 22. Yes. Yes. Yes. Ten can the parlay at plus 10 22 [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=2052.2400000000002s)]
*  as well. Those are the million dollar picks for we tend you like these. I love a pretty good batch. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=2060.88s)]
*  It's so fun. It's time, baby. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVZ1Jtz-F7U&t=2068.32s)]
