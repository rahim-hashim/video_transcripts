# Very Early NFL Over/Unders | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [March 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZBuVosO8IE)
*  Christmas came early on March 26th.
*  We got NFL over unders out of nowhere.
*  It's it almost felt too early, but, uh, Fandel, our friends dropped them and we're
*  going to do a little Malcolm Gladwell blink test.
*  So I've done no research.
*  I don't know who, what the schedule, like who's playing whose divisions.
*  I just, I went through it and I wrote down the ones that just jumped out of me one way
*  or the other where I went, Oh, that seems low or, Oh, that seems a little high.
*  And I just wrote those teams down.
*  So I'm going to go through the ones I had.
*  And then if I missed anything, you tell me what you love.
*  But I had two categories.
*  Okay.
*  So I have my favorites, which we'll get to at the end.
*  And then I wrote down nine teams that had jumped out to me.
*  And my instinct was I want to put money on that, but it was like, hold on, hold
*  on, do some more research.
*  Just the nine teams that just seem too high or too low.
*  Number one, Atlanta nine and a half.
*  They were seven and 10 last year and Kurt Cousins and Raheem Morris are going
*  to be the two big changes, right?
*  New coach, Kurt Cousins coming off of Achilles surgery and it's like, well,
*  that's where three wins is it.
*  Are we sure that's where three wins?
*  Cause my instinct when I saw that was like under they're not going 10 and seven.
*  What did you think when you saw that one?
*  So I don't want to touch this one at all because I think it's priced properly.
*  Um, you look at a team who was 12th and adjusted games lost due to injury.
*  And that's a, that's a metric that I look at heavily.
*  Were you healthy last year?
*  Were you not healthy?
*  Um, you know, teams who were healthy, they tend to regress it to me and vice versa.
*  And then you need, I also look at their Pythagorean expectation.
*  They won seven games.
*  They were expected to win seven games.
*  So I think a lot of people are going to look at this and say Desmond
*  Ritter, he was so hard.
*  Desmond Ritter to cousins.
*  That's three wins.
*  Or that's what people plus Arthur Smith to Reheme Morris.
*  That's right.
*  All right.
*  We talked about them too much.
*  So blink test your stay away.
*  Um, shading toward under next one for me was Buffalo under 10 and a half.
*  They were 11 and six last year and they've lost some people in free agency.
*  And my instinct just immediately was 11 and six seems ambitious, but I don't,
*  I just don't know.
*  I'm tired of losing money on Josh Allen.
*  So it's probably a stay away, but I was leaning under.
*  What do you have?
*  Well, I mean, you look at the last four seasons.
*  Well, yeah, the last four seasons, 11 wins, 13 wins, 11 wins, 13 wins.
*  So if you have a top tier quarterback, you're typically in that area, but I do
*  think that the vision is better.
*  You're going to have Aaron Rogers, regardless of what people think of him.
*  The Jets have given the Buffalo Bills problems.
*  You got to deal with them.
*  You got to deal with the dolphins.
*  I think the Patriots are going to be a lot better.
*  So I wouldn't be looking to play this over at all.
*  Okay.
*  Houston over eight and a half, their 10 and seven last year, you know,
*  I want that team getting better.
*  So you like that one.
*  All right.
*  I'll bowl.
*  I'm all in on Houston.
*  Yeah.
*  So I thought that was going to be nine and a half and I was confused
*  why I was eight and a half, especially like they have one more draft.
*  They had some, I still think they have some cap space.
*  It's full year CJ Stroud.
*  I don't love their division.
*  All right.
*  So we like that one.
*  Both KC is over 11 and a half.
*  And my instinct was, oh man, just take my homes every year, but they did go 11
*  and six last year, but I did flag that one.
*  It's hard for me to think they're not going 10 and seven.
*  So there'll be there 11 and six, 12 and somewhere in that area.
*  Right.
*  Well, they led the league in drops last year.
*  So that's a big part of their six losses.
*  So I think you, you almost got to be looking over here.
*  Minnesota is over six and a half and that there's a lot of juice in that area.
*  That was minus one 44 as we're taping this, they were seven and 10 last year.
*  Cousins missed two thirds of the year.
*  They brought in Sam Darnold.
*  The reason I liked this as an over and it jumped out to me is it feels like
*  they're a trade up team for one of the four quarterbacks and let's say they
*  get Jayden Daniels, let's say they move up to the path spot or number three, or
*  even if let's say Jayden Daniels falls to number four and do a flop of the
*  flip of Arizona and they're bringing in Jayden Danos right away.
*  Seven and 10 seems fair for them.
*  What'd you have for that one?
*  This is one I got to do a little bit more research on.
*  Like to me, stay away.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, they were one of the healthiest teams last year and they over
*  performed their Pythagorean.
*  So like without knowing who the quarterback is and you know, this seemed
*  like a team who was really just in rebuilding mode.
*  I just don't want to touch it over right now.
*  Okay.
*  This is my favorite one.
*  The jets are nine and a half and I reacted both ways.
*  The over is plus one 16 and the under is minus one 42.
*  And initially I was like nine and a half.
*  That's too low.
*  And then I was like, not a half.
*  That's way too high.
*  And then I was like, stay away, stay away.
*  Did you lean either way on that one?
*  I would lean towards the over.
*  I just think their quarterback play was just so bad last year.
*  Right.
*  That's three wins.
*  They were seven and 10 last year.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, like, so I would lean towards the over.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, like, so I would definitely lean towards the over here.
*  So you think Roger's in the place of all the crap they had last year, assuming he's healthy.
*  Mike Williams added to the wide receiver.
*  Left tackle, Tyron Smith, number 10 pick, possibly a weapon.
*  Maybe it's a tackle.
*  Maybe it's Brock Bowers.
*  Maybe it's another receiver.
*  And the division's probably worse except for the Pats.
*  Yeah.
*  They won seven games at each of the last two seasons and they had like total crap at quarterback.
*  So I think Roger's like, I'm still giving Rogers the respect.
*  He can put up a 94 Joe Montana seat.
*  Counter to that one is Robert Soto.
*  Are we sure he can ever win 10 games?
*  Have we seen one thing from that dude that makes us think he's a 10 win coach?
*  That's why.
*  That's why I put it in this category.
*  Just quickly.
*  I know you're in Philly.
*  Philly, the 10 and a half is perfect.
*  They were 11 and six last year.
*  I leaned toward under because I think they're going to be worse.
*  And I think them going 11 and six would kind of be surprising,
*  but I need to research that one more.
*  Did you have a lean on that?
*  So this is tough for me because I do think there's a little bit of value on the Eagles
*  to possibly go to the Super Bowl.
*  To go over.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I am obviously, I'm worried about the offensive line.
*  I mean, you got a hall of fame, we're retiring.
*  So I'm worried about that.
*  But I just think when you get rid of Brian Johnson,
*  he was just so bad at offensive coordinator last year.
*  I think you bring in like this is a team who was 10 and one last year.
*  And then the wheels completely fell off.
*  So I have trouble believing it.
*  The second half of the season was real.
*  I think the it's just somewhere in the middle.
*  So I would probably lean towards the over.
*  That's why I had it in that shorter group.
*  Two more Pittsburgh over seven and a half from Tennessee over six and a half.
*  Pittsburgh goes nine and eight or 10 and seven every year.
*  So this is purely a Russell Wilson is their quarterback line.
*  And then Tennessee at six and a half.
*  They're six and 11 last year.
*  And they did a lot of good stuff over the summer.
*  They have the seventh pick.
*  I like their free agent moves, their trades, new coach.
*  I don't know if it's going to be a new coach bump for them because I really like variable,
*  but not that great of a division.
*  If I had to pick between those two and I wouldn't pick either at this point,
*  but I would probably lean toward Tennessee over six and a half.
*  Which one do you like more out of those two?
*  So Tennessee made a bunch of win now moves, which didn't make sense to me.
*  They were a team where I felt like they should be rebuilding and they made all these win now moves.
*  So now I mean, just your six and a half win total.
*  It's kind of dead on, but I just don't really want to play it.
*  And then when it comes to Pittsburgh, we all know about the Mike Tomlin food.
*  Like at the end of the day, as long as TJ Watt is healthy,
*  they're going to be in the mix for a potential playoff spot.
*  And then I expect I'm not big on Russell Wilson at this point in time.
*  I think he's pretty wise, but Mike Tomlin has shown that he could win games with whoever's back there.
*  He's probably going to be the best quarterback they've had since the old big Ben.
*  So you never really want to go under on a Pittsburgh win total.
*  And I'm, I'm the guy who typically likes to play unders more than anything else.
*  Yeah.
*  My thing is that if they can't hit the over on this, he's probably not the coach in the year.
*  Right.
*  That'll be it.
*  If he goes seven and 10, six and 11, that's, that's probably a wrap.
*  He probably leaves.
*  All right.
*  I have four favorites, but let's go to you.
*  What was your favorite blink test?
*  What was your favorite one?
*  The one that jumped out the most here.
*  Arizona Cardinals over six and a half.
*  I have it.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, 29th and adjusted games lost.
*  You bring, I mean, Gannon has proven that he's a great head coach
*  and then you have a whole season of Kyle Murray.
*  So you have those three factors.
*  Wait, there's another factor.
*  How about the fourth pick in the draft?
*  Oh yeah.
*  And that too.
*  So I just, I just think there's so many things going for this team that,
*  I mean, that's a dead nuts over to me.
*  Divisions worse, right?
*  Rams are at least going sideways and maybe down nowhere in Donald.
*  Seattle, maybe sideways, San Francisco, especially if they trade IU.
*  I don't think they'll be better next year.
*  It's a nice spot for them.
*  I also really liked the way Arizona played.
*  We were talking about it.
*  You guys were talking about it on the wise guys show in general.
*  We were all kind of jumping on them down the stretch because they were,
*  they're pretty frisky.
*  All right.
*  So I had that one too.
*  There's juice on that already.
*  That's minus one 28.
*  That was also one of my four favorites.
*  Do you have anything else?
*  So I'm, I'm gonna let you go.
*  I'm gonna let you go.
*  I'm still like looking at some of these.
*  So this was more than a blink test.
*  I had to put this in the group.
*  It was my least favorite of these four, but green Bay over nine and a half.
*  When they were nine and eight last year with a young team
*  that really got better as the year went along.
*  Now one more draft.
*  I don't really feel like they had any like dramatic losses that made me too nervous.
*  I like a full year of love and 10 and seven, 11 and six seems reasonable.
*  I'd be surprised over nine and a half means they'd have to just go nine and eight again.
*  How are they not one win better than they were last year?
*  So that one jumped out to me.
*  I can definitely see that one.
*  I like, I need to look at their schedule.
*  I think that's the one thing that's holding me back.
*  Like I mentioned before, I'm all in on Houston.
*  Like that's one that I'm like one of my favorites.
*  I already placed a bet on them to, you know, yeah, I like, I love Houston.
*  I just think they made like one of the biggest market inefficiencies in the NFL is a,
*  a, a quarterback, a star quarterback on the rookie deal.
*  Like look at all the guys they signed.
*  Dalton, Charles, Daniel, honey, the Nico, Audrey, like Jeff Acuta, like that team is stacked.
*  So I'm all in on all of them.
*  I mean, I'm on CJ shroud to win MVP.
*  I'm on Houston to win a division.
*  Like any way I can get Houston, I'm buying it.
*  I like it.
*  My second favorite one.
*  You're not going to like this.
*  You know where I'm going.
*  Where are you going?
*  The Dallas Cowboys under 10 and a half.
*  They were 12 and five last year.
*  You basically sat out free agency.
*  I don't see it.
*  I don't see how the Cowboys are like a actual contender this year.
*  Plus you, you brought McCarthy back for reasons that remain unclear.
*  You're paying your best players.
*  I think are going to be pretty expensive.
*  And even the stuff Jerry Jones says about like, yeah, I don't know.
*  We're going to have to work around the fringes.
*  Like their whole attitude this year, it just kind of seems like they're
*  I don't want to say it's a transition year, but it's definitely not a typical Cowboys.
*  We're going all in.
*  You know, we're, we are here to win the Superbowl.
*  It doesn't have that vibe this year.
*  So are they 10 and seven?
*  Yeah.
*  But at the under was appetizing to me and there's action on it's minus 130.
*  So when it comes to win totals of 10 or 10 or more since 2000, they've only gone over 46% of the time.
*  So if you just blindly just look at those win totals of 10 and a half or more and start looking under,
*  almost fading the public.
*  Yeah.
*  Like I think you're in a good position now when it comes to this Cowboys team.
*  I, I definitely agree with you.
*  Like I just, I don't know what they're going to do in a draft.
*  It doesn't seem like they, they have it together at running back position.
*  Like this could be the last season.
*  Who's your running back?
*  I don't know.
*  At this point, we should mention, but he's a Cowboys fan.
*  That's why I said, is he running back the little guy?
*  That's like the only running back of the roster, right?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I'm pilot went to Tennessee.
*  Yeah.
*  We just, we just don't know.
*  And this could be the last season of DAC in, in, in Dallas, because who knows if they're
*  going to pay him next year.
*  So it's just, I don't see, I think the division is a little better.
*  So yeah, I would definitely lean under here.
*  Well, that leads to my favorite of the whole thing.
*  Washington over six and a half minus 142.
*  There's been some action already.
*  They're four and 13 last year upgrading from Ron Rivera to Dan Quinn.
*  I don't, I don't think Dan Quinn has been some party,
*  but I know he's better than Ron Rivera, right?
*  They have, I think six picks in the top hundred.
*  They're definitely going to add a quarterback right away out of the draft.
*  At number two, they did some smart free agent signings that I like just in general.
*  It's like a new vibe, new energy.
*  And I think the division's worse.
*  I think you think Philly might be better, but I also think there's a scenario where
*  there might be worse.
*  I know Dallas is going to be worse and the giants, the Danny Dimes contract just
*  feels like it's going to handicap them.
*  Plus they lost Saquon.
*  Can they go seven and 10?
*  Come on.
*  I can see that.
*  I can definitely see that.
*  I can see, I can see that with Washington.
*  I can't.
*  I thought you'd be more excited.
*  That's my favorite pick.
*  Actually, I got one that I like.
*  Okay.
*  Let's hear it.
*  I'm going to go to New England Patriots.
*  Over or under?
*  I'm going to go over.
*  Okay.
*  Make the case.
*  Okay.
*  Look, you got a new head coach and we all love Belichick.
*  It's one of the greatest of all time, but I do think his message is one thing.
*  So you got a head coach who's, I mean, more suited towards millennials.
*  You get rid of Mac Jones.
*  How many games did he cost you guys last year?
*  That's a big step up right there.
*  I mean, you look at this team, go through the games.
*  They outgained the Philadelphia Eagles.
*  They should have won that game.
*  You go against the game against the Colts.
*  They should have won that game.
*  There were so many games last year that I felt like they should have won
*  and they completely fell apart and they won four games last year.
*  So I'm with you, except for the fact that they treated free agency like they were at
*  the 99 cents store.
*  And every single thing about this off season has been a pretty much a disaster.
*  Even Kraft did a press conference today and he's like, I didn't,
*  I don't know what they were doing with that documentary.
*  He was doing that stuff.
*  And oh, we really wanted Calvin Ridley.
*  His girlfriend wanted to stay in the South.
*  That's the only free agent you wanted.
*  There was like a hundred free agents.
*  They still have a ton of money to spend that they just didn't spend.
*  And I don't really know what the strategy is.
*  I'm worried they're going to trade back.
*  Maybe if they trade back, that helps your theory.
*  So the Pats were five and a half.
*  Yeah.
*  And then also, I mean, this was one of the most injured teams last year.
*  So that's true.
*  They lost Gonzalez and Judon and a bunch of linemen on both sides.
*  So, I mean, you have a team that's slightly underperformed.
*  They're probably one of the most injured teams last year.
*  I think they were 30th in the Justi games loss.
*  You combine those factors, new head coach, better quarterback.
*  Like I don't expect anybody to play as bad as Mac Jones did last year.
*  Counter.
*  Who is the worst team in the AFC?
*  When you think of it that way, the Pats over gets a little scarier
*  because there's usually two or three bad teams in each conference.
*  Usually two is like a fair guess.
*  But if you go through all the teams, they might have a case for being the worst team
*  in the conference, at least from a talent standpoint.
*  It'd be them or the Chargers, right?
*  And the Chargers at least have Herbert.
*  They just brought in Harbaugh.
*  You might say the Raiders, but the Raiders have at least a couple of blue chippers
*  on both ends.
*  They're going to have a high pick.
*  But the Pats are in that conversation and that conversation usually means
*  three and 14, four and 13.
*  I thought over too, because I'm with you.
*  That was a team that easily could have gone nine and eight last year if the QB
*  and the kicker was better.
*  But they basically punted on Freya to see what sure is me.
*  All right.
*  So you weren't excited about Washington.
*  So it seems like the one we're the most excited about collectively is Houston over eight and a half.
*  Yeah. Houston and Arizona.
*  Those are the two that jumped out.
*  Houston and Arizona. Those two.
*  All right. So Arizona over six and a half.
*  I want to do more research, but it's just like the first two that jumped out to me.
*  Those were those were.
*  Well, usually the more we stare at this, this is when the under start popping up.
*  By the time we get to June, July, it's like, oh, under.
*  Oh, there's no way they're getting that.
*  Dallas.
*  I'll be really interested to see if that Dallas drops.
*  If that Dallas ends up at nine and a half versus 10 and a half for over under.
*  I could see that.
*  I could see that going down one.
*  What do you think about Baltimore under?
*  Because they lost a lot of pieces.
*  I lost.
*  I just don't bet against Baltimore anymore.
*  Last year, I picked them not to make the playoffs.
*  I was like, it's not going to happen.
*  And then all of a sudden you pick them up.
*  It's so crazy.
*  It took some chances.
*  So a lot of people like I was on them to be a contender last year.
*  I thought they had a real chance of going to the Super Bowl.
*  But I think this year with all of the pieces that they lost
*  and a lot of people are hype over Derek Henry.
*  I mean, you got a 30 year old running back.
*  And they lost a lot of pieces on defense.
*  I think this is the under to take.
*  And it's juice for a reason on Fandler.
*  Minus 130 for the under.
*  Plus 106 for the over.
*  So that's the under I probably will be on.
*  And then when you look at the fact that Joe Burrow is coming back,
*  like he should be healthy.
*  At the end of the day, Cleveland, I expect Deshaun Watson to be healthy.
*  And a lot of people are going to say, oh, Deshaun Watson didn't play well last year.
*  Well, he was starting to figure it out.
*  And that team still won 11 games with four different quarterbacks.
*  And if you have a better quarterback in Pittsburgh,
*  I think Baltimore takes a step back.
*  Actually, I think this is my favorite.
*  I'm going Baltimore under.
*  That was great.
*  I'm glad we talked it out.
*  I'm so tired of losing money on Baltimore.
*  And then when I rallied around and then they killed me in the KC Playoff game.
*  Yeah, I think Baltimore part of their strategy is they let some older guys go
*  and brought it and they're going to bring in young guys.
*  They draft it and guys that were behind the older guys.
*  And this always works out for them.
*  And it's like, who's that guy?
*  Oh, my God, that linebacker they have is amazing.
*  I've never heard of them.
