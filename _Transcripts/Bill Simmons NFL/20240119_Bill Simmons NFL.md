# The Biggest Game of Josh Allen's Life #billsimmons #nfl #shorts #podcast #joshallen
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [January 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fZ6Pua3Dog)
*  We're talking like, who's got more pressure to win this week?
*  Josh Allen or Lamar Jackson. Classic topic. We're going into it.
*  I got a text from somebody of like Lamar throwing snowballs at practice.
*  They're like, yes, he's wilting under the pressure this week.
*  And I'm like, all right.
*  The answer is Josh Allen. Yeah, I agree.
*  I mean, this is the biggest game of his life.
*  And this is the year for Josh Allen when Burroughs out injured,
*  you're home against the Chiefs and you've got all the playoff experience over Lamar Jackson.
*  If that's the matchup, like this is the year for Josh Allen.
*  This should be the year. That's pressure.
*  I think this owning Josh Allen matters to Mahomes.
*  You would never say this. I have no evidence, but that's his rival.
*  It's him and Burroughs and Allen's never beaten him in a playoff game.
*  And I think Mahomes wants to keep it that way, obviously.
*  But I just think this is like a classic.
*  If you're the best player of your generation, you win this game.
