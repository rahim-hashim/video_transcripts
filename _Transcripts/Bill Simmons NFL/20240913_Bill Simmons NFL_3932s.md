# Packers Problem, Bengals Bounce Back, and the Worst Holdout Ever? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo)
*  All right. I wasn't able to have this guy on before the season, but he's here now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=0.0s)]
*  Our old friend, Michael Lombardi, week one in the books, week two coming. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3.52s)]
*  This is one of my favorite. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=7.68s)]
*  We text a lot during this time because there's a lot of stuff we either know for sure that people [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=9.68s)]
*  don't fully know yet, but we feel like we do, or there's stuff you think, but you want to see it [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=15.52s)]
*  for another week. And then there's this stuff that's just, I have no effing idea. Here's one thing [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  I know for sure Lombardi. Malik Willis is terrible at playing quarterback and he's going to start, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=26.08s)]
*  he's going to start week two for the Packers. And I was waiting, I thought Monday they'd sign [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  somebody and Tuesday it's like, oh, when's the Tannehill announcement coming? Then Wednesday, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=37.76s)]
*  and now it's Thursday. And they're just rolling with it. They're going to play Malik Willis, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=41.28s)]
*  a guy that both of us watched play quarterback in real games. He started three, he went one and two, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=45.28s)]
*  it didn't go well. And what are they doing? What are they thinking? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=52.16s)]
*  All right. So let's go back. We'll touch on Malik in a second. They tried to, Ryan Tannehill and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=55.44s)]
*  Matt LaFleur have the same agent. So there was conversations, but I think Tannehill was like, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=60.8s)]
*  I'm not going somewhere unless somebody pays X, Y, or Z. And so that ended that conversation. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=65.84s)]
*  And now somebody in that building, I don't know who it was, saw a tape of Malik Willis, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=71.52s)]
*  and I don't know what tape they watched that said, hey, he's going to be a really good backup one [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=76.96s)]
*  day. Like, I don't know where that was. I'll be in search of it. I mean, it's like finding the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=82.32s)]
*  lock best sponsor that tape. But let's have them walk down memory lane and talk about one of the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=86.72s)]
*  greatest games in NFL history. A game that should be in the Hall of Fame, a game that Malik Willis [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=92.63999999999999s)]
*  participated in. It was in early November in Kansas City. It was a Sunday night game. I'm [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=98.88s)]
*  sure Al's tie was perfectly laced up there. No, the Al wasn't probably, he might have been doing [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=104.08s)]
*  that. But anyway, so Kansas City plays Tennessee. Malik starts. And from the beginning, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=108.72s)]
*  it's a disaster. Malik attempts 16 passes in the game. He completes five. One of them was a 48 [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=115.2s)]
*  yarder to the tight end on the screen on the first drive of the game. He came 80 yards in that game. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=121.36s)]
*  Now, as bad as that was, the great Mike Grable, one of the great head coaches in our league, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  got the Kansas City Chiefs who won the Super Bowl that year to overtime. And remember, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=133.12s)]
*  it took two Patrick Mahomes runs scrambling out of the pocket to get the game to overtime. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=140.08s)]
*  That's how, and so, I don't know how this works for the Green Bay defense and Matt LaFleur [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=146.4s)]
*  ain't Mike Grable. I could tell you that. How do you do this? And so you sit there and say, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=152.32s)]
*  here's what they all say whenever they get a quarterback like Malik. Well, we'll run a [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=157.6s)]
*  lot of boots, we'll run a lot of nakeds, we'll give him a lot of easy throws. The problem is he [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=161.28s)]
*  can't make an easy throw. Yeah. I remember that game as the Mike Grable is one of the five or six [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=164.72s)]
*  best coaches in the league audition tape. And of course he's unemployed right now. Of course he is. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=171.76s)]
*  I think that game belongs in Canton. I mean, that's one of the finest coaching to take as good a [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=177.76s)]
*  coach as Andy Reid is with his Patrick Mahomes and Kelsey was a better player. And they had guys. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  And to get that game to overtime when the, when basically they were playing 10 on 11. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, do you realize this? I've said this many times, Malik Willis is the only quarterback I've [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=192.48s)]
*  ever seen in the history of my career that got benched during a drive in a preseason game. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=198.08s)]
*  Grable had had enough and basically set another quarterback out there and said, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=204.16s)]
*  get him out. Cause he was screwing up everybody else. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=208.08s)]
*  Well, how about they traded him for a seventh round pick? What? Oh, a month ago? I know the Packers [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=210.88s)]
*  probably saw him as a reclamation project, but you know, if they go all in five to start the season [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=216.64s)]
*  or they go one and four, I think they kind of have to go two and three in the first five. If love's [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=222.88s)]
*  really going to be gone a month, maybe they think they can push it back sooner. But we've seen [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=228.16s)]
*  seasons where if the team doesn't fix it in the first month, it becomes impossible to come back. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=232.23999999999998s)]
*  What do you think it's nine or 10 wins for the seventh seed in the NFC? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=238.0s)]
*  I think it'll be nine. I think there's too much competition. I think, I mean, I don't know if [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=241.04s)]
*  we'd get to the Bears later, but I don't know where this all comes from. But look, I don't know [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=247.6s)]
*  how you win games. I mean, if Indianapolis doesn't go up there and if Malik Willis is the starter, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=252.32s)]
*  now the floor is couching as if they're going to go eventually to that. There's a chance that [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=257.36s)]
*  love can play. I don't see how that is, but maybe he, maybe it wasn't as bad as we thought, you know, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=262.96s)]
*  maybe there's not any swelling. But I mean, if they, if Indy doesn't go up there and win by 10 [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=268.24s)]
*  points, then something's really wrong with Indy, which I think something is really wrong with [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=273.52s)]
*  Indy. But Green Bay, I don't know. Look, it's so interesting when you follow that this whole [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=277.28000000000003s)]
*  quarterback carousel. So Malik Willis and Bo Nicks were both at Auburn. Bo Nicks won the starting [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=282.24s)]
*  job. Malik transfers to Liberty, right? Sean Clifford, the third string quarterback at Green Bay [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=287.76s)]
*  was at Penn State along with the great Will Levis. Levis couldn't beat him out. He's third string in [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=293.76s)]
*  Green Bay. Meanwhile, Levis is talking about being the starting quarterback and turning the Titans [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=299.36s)]
*  franchise around. Like somebody makes sense of all this for me. Like if Walsh, Bill Walsh would have [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=303.92s)]
*  said, wait a minute, he didn't beat out Sean Clifford and we don't like Sean Clifford. Like [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=308.88s)]
*  why do we think we're going to make him into a good player? He started three games. They scored [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=313.76s)]
*  48 points in the three games. He had 11 first downs in the three games. Passed the first downs. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=319.76s)]
*  Got sacked 10 times. I think those numbers are painful to listen to, but watching it was more [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=328.0s)]
*  painful. Yeah, I don't get it. You know, you mentioned the Indianapolis defense because that's [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=334.32s)]
*  another piece of this game. Cause I'm going to do million dollar picks later with House and [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=340.08s)]
*  just spoiler alert. I just feel like this is a once in a lifetime chance to bet against Malik [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=344.08s)]
*  Willis. It seems like we're heading that way. And Indy's minus three. And the reason they're [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=349.12s)]
*  minus three is because their defense Houston ran all over it. But this is what I love about [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=353.04s)]
*  week one heading into week two, where you think certain things because of what happened in week [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=358.64s)]
*  one, but maybe some other things are true that you don't fully realize yet. And one of the things [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=363.36s)]
*  with Indy's D and you've been, you've been super critical of them, Gus Bradley, Vanellas scheme, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=367.76s)]
*  all that stuff. And I totally get that. But what if Houston's offense is just awesome? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=372.24s)]
*  And it's like, we either have to give up this. It's almost like San Francisco against the jets. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=377.44s)]
*  We either have to give up this or this. So we're going to give up this and hopefully you don't [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=382.64s)]
*  kill us with this. And San Francisco is like, cool, we're going to run all over you. And Houston, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=386.56s)]
*  it almost felt like they were more comfortable. You want to just run Joe Mixon. Cool. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=391.28000000000003s)]
*  We don't want to give away big plays. We're afraid of Stroud. And if you want to gash us that way, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=396.24s)]
*  I mean, they stayed in the game. They only lost by two. So I guess my question is, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=400.72s)]
*  is Indy's defense that bad or is Houston's offense that good? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=404.72s)]
*  Okay. So Indy's defense is bad when they go against the coach who's very good at understanding what [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=410.88000000000005s)]
*  they're doing in the scheme. Indy's defense can look better at times when they go against [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=416.08000000000004s)]
*  not a good offensive coordinator, but Slowak understood what they were doing. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=421.12s)]
*  And in your analogy there, they didn't take away Nico Collins. Like if, if Gus Bradley would have [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=424.8s)]
*  worked for Al Davis from the time the season ended until that first game, he would, every day Al [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=430.8s)]
*  Davis would have called him on the phone and said, what are we planning on doing for Nico? Like we [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=436.64s)]
*  can't let Nico Collins beat us. And of course Nico Collins beat us. I get the theory, let Joe Mixon [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=440.48s)]
*  run on it. But one of those Nico Collins plays, he had, I mean, he caught a pass with two guys draped [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=445.92s)]
*  all over him for like 50 years. I don't know what else you can do in that situation. It's the [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=451.28000000000003s)]
*  Belichick in and out coverage. Belichick hates that, you know, you got them, I got them, nobody [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=456.08s)]
*  got them. Right. And so he just ran, he split it. So I don't think Indy wants to win with their [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=460.4s)]
*  defensive line. And this whole theory of Bradley's defense is about if we have four great defense [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=467.84s)]
*  alignment, we'll win the game. That's not working anymore. You don't have four great defense [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=473.68s)]
*  alignment. I mean, you're going to draft, you need a draft from Canton, not from the draft. So [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=478.47999999999996s)]
*  right. Look, I think Houston's really good. I think you're right. That Houston is good. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=483.52000000000004s)]
*  I think they're a little bit better based on Indy because there's so much that they know about one [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=488.08000000000004s)]
*  another. But I mean, look, Stroud made a couple of throws that were big time throws that I didn't [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=493.68s)]
*  think he would make. I mean, the throw on third night at the end of the game was as good a throw [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=499.84000000000003s)]
*  as you're going to make. But to me, Indy's defense, anytime they play a good team who knows how to run [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  the ball against them, who understands how to attack them, I don't think they're good enough. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=510.08s)]
*  Okay. But what if they're playing Malik Willis? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=514.8s)]
*  Well, that's where, okay. So here's what worries me. Here's what worries me that they, you would, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=518.3199999999999s)]
*  like if, if I'm in that building, I'm saying to Gus, Gus, we can't let them run bootlegs. We can't [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=524.48s)]
*  run on run naked. And if you have to get into a short yardage defense on first and 10, no matter [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=528.88s)]
*  what they put on the field, right. Let's go. Let's go nine in the box. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=533.76s)]
*  11 in the box. There was a game. There was a game when I was a kid, I was 13 years old. I was 11 [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=540.24s)]
*  years old and the Packers were playing my favorite team, the Washington Redskins and George Allen was [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=547.2s)]
*  the coach. And the Green Bay Packers had Lynn Vicki, a quarterback, and their best player was [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=553.2s)]
*  John Brockington. He was the running back. And I'll never forget this game. It was a playoff game. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=559.2s)]
*  It was an RFK stadium and George Allen put five defensive linemen on the field. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=564.48s)]
*  It was the first time anybody ever done it. He put five down and he said to John Brockington, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=570.16s)]
*  you run the ball. He had 13 carries for nine yards in the game. And so, but that's what great [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=574.8s)]
*  coaches do. They say, okay, I know this is what you're going to, this is the only way you can win [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=579.68s)]
*  the game. I'm going to take that away from you. That's what I would do if I was at Indy. I would [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=584.0799999999999s)]
*  say, okay, I dare you to run the ball. But these guys are scheme related. When you watch the Jets [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=588.72s)]
*  play 49ers, Kyle got in a formation where it's unbelievable. The Jets had a guy lined up in the [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=594.96s)]
*  A-gap of the guard and the next player was out at the outside shoulder of the tackle. There's a [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=601.52s)]
*  bubble that's as big as anybody to run through. But of course, the 34% winning percentage coach [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=606.72s)]
*  of the Jets, Robert Sala, he made no adjustments to it. He was watching the game like I was. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=612.72s)]
*  So I think to me, we give so much credit for these guys making adjustments when [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=617.68s)]
*  these coaches are getting younger and younger and less and less about in-game adjustments and more [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=621.92s)]
*  about more scheme. What can we do? Like they're not watching the game. Well, I mean, Salah does [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=627.68s)]
*  have eight kids, so it's not like he's not prolific. I mean, he's got that going for him. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=635.04s)]
*  Yeah, I heard he's got a great golf game too. The Green Bay Philly game, because love gets [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=640.88s)]
*  hurt at the end, it throws the Green Bay situation in flux and that's all anyone talked about after. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=646.48s)]
*  But it was also a really interesting game. It was on a ship field. It's in Brazil. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=651.28s)]
*  Both teams alternately look good for stretches. What did you see from Green Bay in that game [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=655.6800000000001s)]
*  before love got hurt to make you think either they're a contender or they aren't? Because [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=661.6800000000001s)]
*  I was going into the season thinking they were either the second or the third best team in the [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=666.8000000000001s)]
*  NFC. And I left the game before love got hurt going, I don't know, maybe they're below San [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=670.24s)]
*  Francisco and Philly and Detroit. Maybe they're in the four to six range. I left that game thinking [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=677.6s)]
*  that maybe I've over-evaluated their talent on defense because I've always felt like they were [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=683.84s)]
*  better on defense than they really were. And they didn't look good on defense to me. They look slow. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=687.44s)]
*  They didn't look explosive. I mean, they've got some good edge rushers, but I thought Philly, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=692.48s)]
*  who I don't think Philly's offensive line is the same as they were in the past, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=696.72s)]
*  but I thought, you know, torching your best corner for an 80 yard touchdown or 60 yard touch. I mean, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=700.64s)]
*  you can't allow that to happen. I think Green Bay was overvalued. I initially thought the way you [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=704.96s)]
*  did, but as the summer went on and I went back and watched the tape, you know, this is a team [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=712.24s)]
*  that lost to Tommy DeVito, right? This is a team that came home against Tampa and lost to Baker [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=717.28s)]
*  Mayfield the next week. So I think they've got, and love is inconsistent at times. He will miss [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=722.16s)]
*  the strike zone. So I kind of felt like they would be a wild card. I never thought they could [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=728.48s)]
*  challenge Detroit for the North. I really didn't. At the end of the day, I thought they weren't good [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=732.56s)]
*  enough. And they're young. I mean, this is the other problem. They're so young that it's hard to, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=737.12s)]
*  you know, they go, I mean, they probably spent the least amount of cap money of any team in the league [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=742.16s)]
*  because they did this, spent a lot this year because they signed love, but they're so young. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=747.76s)]
*  Now they've got great receivers. Don't get me wrong. The Eagles, I think the other issue is [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=752.24s)]
*  if it's a better field, you know, I don't know what happens. The Eagles can't, don't leave Brazil [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=756.24s)]
*  thinking the Eagles defense is better than it was last year. Like, I'm not sure that's right. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=762.8s)]
*  Yeah. And the Packers receivers, I didn't think had a very good game compared to what their talent is, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=767.2s)]
*  but I look at these, House and I talked about this last week. Sometimes I wonder [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=771.68s)]
*  with these overseas games. If you just throw them out, they're almost like the Thursday games [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=776.64s)]
*  where it's just like, it's too weird. It's, I mean, that game was 10 hours away. The field was shit. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=781.28s)]
*  It was a Friday night. Everything about it was weird and maybe you throw it away, but then [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=787.04s)]
*  love gets hurt. Anyway, I think the one thing that jumped out from the Eagle side is just, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=791.68s)]
*  oh yeah, Saquon Barkley is really good. Like, why were we overthinking this? This guy's better than [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=796.4s)]
*  Deandre Swift. Stop. Poor John Mara. I mean, don't you, now, how about poor John Mara's weekend? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=800.48s)]
*  This weekend, the owner of the Giants, he's got to go take the train down to Washington and hope [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=806.32s)]
*  he can beat that shitty team in Washington. I don't know what House thinks of them, but they're [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=810.96s)]
*  terrible. They have no secondary. But their defense is atrocious. It's atrocious, right? So now he's [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=814.48s)]
*  going to go down there and he's got to pray he wins. So then he's going to take the train back home [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=819.84s)]
*  and then Monday night, he's going to sit in his nice cozy comfy chair in his living room and have [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=822.8000000000001s)]
*  to watch another Saquon Barkley parade. I mean, like he's, and he saw it coming. I mean, he saw [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=826.4000000000001s)]
*  this coming. Well, at least he has the clip, which we talked about on Sunday night was [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=832.64s)]
*  like Vito Corleone in the conference room with all the people. I'm going to hold some people [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=839.1999999999999s)]
*  responsible in this room. If he gets hit by a lightning bolt, if he hangs himself in his jail cell, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=844.16s)]
*  that's basically what he was saying. I'm going to blame some of these people in here. You're done. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=850.64s)]
*  I'm going to blame some people in this room. You're going to be fucking out. But he, you know, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=853.68s)]
*  that was probably the best player in their team. And so, yeah, I mean, look, he, you know, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=860.24s)]
*  he ran the ball effectively. Uh, you know, I didn't think Hertz would mean Hertz throws [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=865.6s)]
*  two interceptions. I worry about the equals decruts because if Detroit's if they, if you [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=870.0s)]
*  can block Philly, you're going to throw the ball and fill it. And you can't get away with Zach Braun [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=875.2s)]
*  and Nigey Dean at linebacker. They're going to have to make some moves. I, to me now, I agree. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=879.52s)]
*  Don't panic on it. It's a, it's a, those games you got throughout that field was so shitty. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=884.48s)]
*  I don't understand why we went to Brazil and there was only like 48,000 people in the stands. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=888.8s)]
*  Like, I think if we're going to go somewhere like that, shouldn't there be a hundred thousand [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=894.3199999999999s)]
*  in the joint? Totally agree. And they didn't even know they're cheering like kickoffs. They didn't [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=898.4799999999999s)]
*  know what was going on. If you, if you were the giant Germany, right. Yeah. Go somewhere. That's [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=903.1999999999999s)]
*  also not that far away. Um, if you're the giants, when do you start thinking about what can we get [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=909.68s)]
*  for Dexter Lawrence? Oh boy. I think if you're the giants, you know, you're not going to, you paid [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=914.88s)]
*  them. Uh, well, do you want to give the giants more draft picks after they picked Evan Neil? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=921.52s)]
*  Well, I just assume everyone's gone. Sam Hankey draft picks. It's like giving Sam draft picks. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=926.96s)]
*  I mean like, you want to give him, but he had all these picks. He couldn't pick anybody. Uh, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=932.32s)]
*  but I just assume everyone's gone. Every, I mean, everyone, maybe not day ball, but everybody else [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=937.28s)]
*  will be gone after this year. Right. So, well, I think to me, you've got to entice whoever they [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=942.08s)]
*  hire if they hire a next coach. Look, they're 36% win percentage teams since Tom Koffer walked out [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=946.64s)]
*  the building. I mean, and John Marra is a really nice person. And I, and I, and I think they do a [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=952.0s)]
*  horrible job of evaluating themselves. I think one of the things I think we have to learn in sports, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=957.44s)]
*  and I learned this when I was in the league. I think you know it too. When you let, when you [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=962.88s)]
*  let hard knocks in your building, when you let them in your building, you better be really good [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=967.2s)]
*  at your job. Because if you're not in the fancy that you're not and you start losing, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=971.76s)]
*  you're going to lose your job. I'm trying to think of a, I'm trying to think of a single scenario [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=977.36s)]
*  where it would make sense to do that. And the only time like Belichick did those do your job, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=983.2s)]
*  those documentaries where they followed the team for a year. But at that point, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=988.4s)]
*  he'd won super bowls. He really cares about the history of the NFL. And I think he wanted [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=991.76s)]
*  people to document, like he also let people write books about them and things like that. If you're, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=996.4s)]
*  if you're a six and 10 team, six and 11 team, or you're the giants, or you're like the bears who [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1001.36s)]
*  you haven't done anything yet, and you've got a Ricky QB, why the fuck do I want cameras around? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1007.12s)]
*  Why do I want people to videotape stuff? Why do I want soundbites, especially in social media era? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1012.0s)]
*  The answer to the question is you think you're good. You think what you're doing is good. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1016.8s)]
*  Like I think it exposed the giants for incompetence. Like they had no plan. They had no model. That's [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1020.4s)]
*  not how you run a team. I'm insulted as a personnel guy who spent my life in the NFL [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1026.16s)]
*  thinking that Joe Shane did what most people do. That's not how you run an NFL team. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1030.96s)]
*  That's if a guy was in a bar at Biggie's in North Jersey, that's how he would run the team, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1036.56s)]
*  not how a professional would run the team. So when you let them in, right? Do you remember the one [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1040.88s)]
*  when, I love this scene, when Herm Edwards was sitting there, they had the camera on him, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1045.1200000000001s)]
*  Dick Curl, his confidant, who was his game manager who could screw up everything for him. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1049.2s)]
*  Dick Curl was like, throw it here. And when he shouldn't throw it, it was like, and so [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1053.92s)]
*  he's sitting there in his office and he's pondering whether he should shot Damon Heard [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1059.52s)]
*  or Brady Coyle. And like you know that neither one's any good. So it doesn't matter who you [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1063.76s)]
*  should start. But to me, once the Kansas City fans saw that there, they lost all confidence in their [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1069.28s)]
*  team. And that's what happens to the giants. You think those fans in the metal lands believe what [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1075.6799999999998s)]
*  they saw from Shane and they saw from their front office that they had any confidence. Then their [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1080.8s)]
*  best player comes, Lawrence, the best player in the history of the franchise comes out and says, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1085.2s)]
*  I can get 22 guys and beat this team. I think Card Nox, the risk reward, the seesaw is like [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1088.8s)]
*  95% risk, 5% reward. Like I still remember the first one ever was the Ravens one, it was after [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1096.96s)]
*  they'd won. And Brian Billich was the coach and they had, and I remember I wrote about it for ESPN [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1103.6000000000001s)]
*  way back when and they took out like 10 of my best jokes. But it was Brian Billich just blowharding [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1109.44s)]
*  it out of his mind. And at one point he was on a hammock and he's reading like some, you know, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1115.8400000000001s)]
*  success book and just like blowharding. And you're watching going, does this guy realize [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1121.76s)]
*  they're filming this? This guy realized like this is going to be on television? This conversation, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1126.4s)]
*  I would never do it. I just, I don't understand the upside. Especially if you're a team that [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1132.4s)]
*  hasn't really proven anything, but when you're the giants, it's not like you're getting the fans [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1137.84s)]
*  more fired up. It's not like you're selling more tickets. You're not selling more merchandise. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1141.84s)]
*  There's no upside. Right. And this week, week two of the season, I mean, this is if Dave Long goes [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1144.9599999999998s)]
*  down there and loses this game, they already have no fan base. I mean, Daniel Jones looks like David [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1150.8s)]
*  Carr now. He just afraid to get hit. He just gotten hit so much. He can't do it. I feel like [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1155.6s)]
*  that was almost insulting to David Carr though. It probably is. I mean, look, I think they should [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1160.0s)]
*  win. I mean, if I had any guts in a, in a, in a, if I had to pick five games, I would probably take [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1167.52s)]
*  the giants plus the points because, you know, you got to take five, but I can understand why you can't. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1172.4s)]
*  I mean, like, like, but I think to me they should be them now Malik neighbors before we came on, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1178.48s)]
*  it's rumored he might've hurt himself in practice today. I don't know how bad that is. So, uh, but [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1184.08s)]
*  look, I think when you let them in your building, you better be damn sure you control. I said, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1189.2s)]
*  you know, I'm up at NFL films every Tuesday with Belichick doing his pod. And I asked Ken Rogers, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1193.36s)]
*  the guy who does the hard knock stuff. I said, Ken, if that's what they showed us, what do you have [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1199.28s)]
*  on the floor? Like, what did you cut out? And he just laughed. I mean, like, I guess they didn't [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1204.0s)]
*  cut anything out, Bill. They didn't must not cut anything out. Like if that's what they're showing [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1210.1599999999999s)]
*  us, how bad could the other stuff be? If I was the GM, I would have definitely cut out the Saquon [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1213.76s)]
*  Barkley conversation with my owner. Basically like you're fucking fucked if this, if this [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1219.28s)]
*  doesn't work out. So big shot Bob Sala, who's 18 and 34 career, who's one of the, uh, one of the [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1223.84s)]
*  20 worst coaches of all time who have coached over 50 games. So you have him on the jet side [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1232.24s)]
*  going into Tennessee in the all time trap game. It's even got the three and a half point trap line. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1237.92s)]
*  It's there's just caution flags and the lanes are moving to one lane. There's construction workers [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1243.9199999999998s)]
*  on the road. Like nobody wants you to keep going down this road with the jets. They had, you know, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1251.12s)]
*  all kinds of buzz before the year. I fell for it. I picked them against San Francisco. I bet on them. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1256.0s)]
*  I bet on them to win the division. Um, and they, uh, just got out coached and run over and now [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1261.1999999999998s)]
*  they're playing Tennessee. So you have that. And then you have day ball and the giants where it's [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1267.84s)]
*  scapegoat time, which we've seen this over and over. We see it, the Lakers do it every year or [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1271.68s)]
*  two years. Palenque is at, I don't know what Darvin Ham's doing. It's like, you picked fucking [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1276.48s)]
*  players. So it's Darvin Ham's fault. It's Frank Vogel's fault two years ago. This is Luke Walton's [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1280.5600000000002s)]
*  fault six years ago, but you somehow you're still here. So it's always the coach. What's going on? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1286.4s)]
*  Um, so the giant, so day ball be the scapegoat. I know you're friends with them, but which, how [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1292.24s)]
*  early can you fire a coach during an NFL season? Like what is, what's crazy? Is it crazy to do it [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1297.36s)]
*  in the first five games? Like you've just gone through preseason training camp, everything. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1303.28s)]
*  Well, we mentioned George Allen earlier. He got fired in preseason. You know, Don, uh, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1308.24s)]
*  Carl Rosenblum fired him in preseason one year. Uh, look, I, I think you have to give it some time, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1313.12s)]
*  right? I mean, cause oh, and two can turn around it. You know, I think to me it's when the coach [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1319.28s)]
*  loses the locker room. And I think to me that hard knocks has made it very challenging. Now, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1324.32s)]
*  you know, just if the giants win this week, doesn't make them a good team. Let's be clear. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1330.08s)]
*  They're not getting, I don't think they get to their five win total because when Sam Darnold [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1333.84s)]
*  goes 99 yards on you and you've got $8 billion in your defensive line and you can't get close to [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1338.24s)]
*  them, you've got deeper problems than just Brian Dayball, right? You know, look, they, they, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1343.9199999999998s)]
*  Tom Coughlin left. Do you remember the scene when Coughlin left? I mean, he walked right by John [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1349.4399999999998s)]
*  Mara after the press conference. He was shaking his hand. He was pissed. Do you remember that? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1353.52s)]
*  And so they fire Coughlin for Ben McAdoo, McAdoo for Pat Shermer, right? Pat Shermer for Joe Judge, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1357.36s)]
*  Joe Judge for Dayball. That's four in a row. You know, what happens to me- [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1364.6399999999999s)]
*  By the way, three doozies before Dayball. I mean, that was really the trifecta. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1369.44s)]
*  Three guys that had no business being a head coach. I mean, no business being a head coach. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1373.6s)]
*  And never coach, never got a head coach job again after that and never will. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1377.44s)]
*  I mean, Pat Shermer's calling plays at Colorado. He's the offense coordinator. Joe Judge is at [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1382.0s)]
*  Ole Miss. But I mean, like, I have no idea. But somebody, what happens in teams when desperation [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1386.8s)]
*  comes in is when exactly the scenario that you said with Polinka, when there's no more buffer [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1393.12s)]
*  between somebody, there's no more, I can't blame this guy, or we need this coach to come in. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1400.3999999999999s)]
*  Dayball got hired to save Daniel Jones, right? Well, that's not working. As I've said on my pod, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1406.16s)]
*  I mean, I love Brian. He's a great guy. But Brian was in Miami. They were terrible at quarterback. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1412.0s)]
*  When they were terrible at quarterback at the Jets, Brian was there. When they were terrible [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1416.88s)]
*  at quarterback in Cleveland, Brian, I mean, you can't make chicken salad out of chicken shit. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1420.0800000000002s)]
*  Like, you've got to have a good player. And when he went to Buffalo, he kind of got his career back. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1425.0400000000002s)]
*  And that's how he became a head coach. So I think the Giants, I mean, this is, to me, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1430.0s)]
*  this is where you have to have an honest conversation with yourself. Are we really [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1435.84s)]
*  good? Are we set up to win? I don't think I've been saying this now, Bill, for five years, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1440.24s)]
*  the Giants haven't set up to win since Kaufman left. They have no identity. They just, they just, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1444.72s)]
*  they look like the Giants when I was growing up in the 70s, where no where I was at Hofstra. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1449.6799999999998s)]
*  And the only game you could watch for the Giants and the Jets talk about a troubled childhood, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1454.48s)]
*  you know? So I think it's hard on them. And then my man, Bobby Sala, I mean, look, I think they- [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1458.24s)]
*  Big shot Bob, by the way, you can take Big Shot Bob if you want to take that one. Take it. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1466.48s)]
*  Take Big Shot Bob. You can have it. I mean, my Lord, I don't understand how you can be part of [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1470.48s)]
*  a Johnson and Johnson pharmaceutical world and think that this guy is going to lead your team [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1477.2s)]
*  in the promised land. Meanwhile, you know, I mean, we could say this about everybody, but [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1481.92s)]
*  he can't make it. He just stands on the sideline. I don't even make adjustments, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1487.3600000000001s)]
*  but he came out this week and told everybody that being O and one with Aaron is a lot better than [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1490.8000000000002s)]
*  being one and O without. Okay, great. And he's going to fix the defense. But here's what I think [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1496.48s)]
*  what happens. Here's what happens with people. They don't pay attention. How many, take a guess, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1500.64s)]
*  how many games Big Shot Bob's defense gave up over 130 yards rushing last year? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1505.68s)]
*  Five? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1514.16s)]
*  Try eight. Eight. Now, if you're the greatest defense since the history of the 2000 Ravens, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1515.52s)]
*  you may give up 200 yard games, right? You're not giving up any. But of course, naturally they gave [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1523.12s)]
*  up eight. People have run the ball on New England, the second, third game of the year round the ball [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1528.48s)]
*  up and down the field and when they beat them. Like, I don't want to hear that this is there. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1533.28s)]
*  They've got some talented players, but this isn't a defense that just doesn't stone everybody. Like, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1537.2s)]
*  they're going to have a hard time. And they're, and you know, what's gotten lost in all this is [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1542.24s)]
*  nobody talks about how bad the Jets offense is in terms of how basic it is. It's day one West [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1546.8s)]
*  coast install. I mean, it's not complicated at all. I mean, the first third down was why stick? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1552.4s)]
*  Like they run that over here at Ocean City High School. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1558.4s)]
*  I thought one of the reasons I thought that might be better is because Rogers can do so much on the [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1563.04s)]
*  offensive side. Well, Sal, the one thing we know he can do is coach a defense and then their defense [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1567.68s)]
*  looked like complete crap. He's another, he's like Gus Bradley though. They don't have anything on [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1573.52s)]
*  their call sheet. Like in that game, the way that Kyle attacked him, the way Kyle attacked him, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1577.68s)]
*  if you listen to what Belichick was saying on the Manny podcast, you know, it was interesting. There [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1582.96s)]
*  were two things going on there. The Manny podcast was talking about, Bill was talking about the C [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1586.48s)]
*  gap runs. But then when you went to Troy Aikman, Troy was saying, well, they're running inside and [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1590.16s)]
*  they had these stats. Well, that's because the guy collecting the data doesn't understand that [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1594.32s)]
*  just because the ball gets run inside. It's a, it's a big gap play. Like these, all these runs [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1598.48s)]
*  were attacking the edges of the jet's defense. They're C gap runs. And if you don't, if you're [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1604.24s)]
*  not sturdy on the C gap, but when Kyle did such a good job was he got angles on everybody. So [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1608.48s)]
*  instead of having to power somebody off the line, he just had to turn somebody. And it's brilliant. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1614.24s)]
*  Walsh used to say this all the time, you know, all these coaches want to draw pass plays, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1619.28s)]
*  but the great coaches know how to run the ball. Kyle knows how to run the ball. And when you know [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1623.6s)]
*  how to run the ball against big shot Bob, you can do some things. That's why eight teams were able [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1628.1599999999999s)]
*  to go over 130, not over a hundred, over 130. So there is a scenario if they lost to Will Levis [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1633.6799999999998s)]
*  and God help them if they lose to Will Levis on Sunday, they play Thursday night against the [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1642.6399999999999s)]
*  Patriots in New Jersey and the Patriots who I, and I want to talk about them in a second. I have no [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1647.9199999999998s)]
*  idea if they're good or not, but on paper, the type of team that they can try to run the ball [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1655.76s)]
*  down the jets, throw four days rest from the last game. Maybe try to just out hustle them, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1660.32s)]
*  out coach them. And somehow the jets are down 10, nothing. The crowds booing, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1666.72s)]
*  oh, and three is looming. And there's a 10 days before the next game stretch coming up. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1671.52s)]
*  And I don't know if I'm a jets fan, I'm like, man, if we lose to Tennessee, this could [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1676.88s)]
*  go sideways fast. You got Rogers, who's not shy about, you know, throwing a little gasoline on [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1681.44s)]
*  the fire sometimes. I don't know. I, it's, it's [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1687.1200000000001s)]
*  much when in New York, I couldn't agree with you more about, look on paper, turning the jets card [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1691.52s)]
*  in and laying three and a half to Will Levis, who his head coach admitted last week, if they would [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1697.84s)]
*  have punted the ball on first down, they would have won the game. Right. I mean, that's it. That's [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1703.44s)]
*  a very toxic statement. I have no confidence in Will. I've never did. Like I was, I do Russo [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1708.0s)]
*  every Friday afternoon and we make three ticks. And I, and I was talking about how Chicago was [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1714.72s)]
*  way overvalued at four and a half and three. And, and he, and, and, and then I didn't take it in one [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1719.76s)]
*  of my three and he, and he took it. And I said, he said, I can't believe you didn't take it. You [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1724.96s)]
*  were talking so much. I see. Cause I don't trust Will Levis is bad. I knew Chicago wasn't worth [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1729.04s)]
*  that number, but you didn't, you got to play the Will Levis factor in there. So, and then how do [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1733.52s)]
*  they like, let's put, go through it. How does Tennessee get open against the jets? I mean, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1738.6399999999999s)]
*  they're going to the receivers in Tennessee aren't going to get the Hopkins isn't getting open. They [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1743.52s)]
*  don't even have to put sauce Garner on it. I put Garner on Ridley. Like how do they, how do they [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1747.2s)]
*  move the ball on the jets? How do they make plays? So how did it, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1751.44s)]
*  it's a game that should win. And yet I'm never taking them ever. They should win by 14. They [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1756.24s)]
*  should win by three and a half. Did you win by 14? One of my favorite Lombardi things. And this [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1761.36s)]
*  really, this is the difference between somebody like you and somebody like me. Cause you work for [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1767.4399999999998s)]
*  a bunch of teams and you really understand this. You always had that thing about, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1770.8799999999999s)]
*  if I don't do this now, I lose the locker room and the season's over. Once you lose the locker room, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1775.52s)]
*  that's it. There's no going back. It feels like we're there with Cleveland with the Sean. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1782.64s)]
*  Yeah. He was, he was, he's been so bad. He was so bad against Dallas. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1788.16s)]
*  I don't know what he's good at anymore. When I watch like he used to be, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1793.44s)]
*  you know, he'd scramble around. He used to be dangerous. He used to be explosive. He just [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1798.96s)]
*  seems to me like a guy who's shell shocked. We'd sound, I talked on Sunday night. There was that [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1804.5600000000002s)]
*  one play he just went straight back. He got perfect blocking and he just decided to veer out to the [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1808.64s)]
*  right. Zach Wilson style. And you could just see three Browns linemen just kind of watching him [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1815.1200000000001s)]
*  going, we just fucking block for you with fuck you going. And he just to run away. It just seems like [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1820.4s)]
*  he's a lost cause is Stefanski at the point where if he does, like, let's say they're awful this [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1826.48s)]
*  week and I think they're going to be like, how do you just keep starting this guy? You can't. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1834.0s)]
*  Well, we have to because the owner, Bill, they doubled down on this deal. They guaranteed a [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1838.72s)]
*  salary this year, which was already guaranteed. So next year's cap number goes up to 72 million. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1844.24s)]
*  His accelerator, you can't cut them. Like this is worse. This is going to make George Payton feel [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1849.3600000000001s)]
*  happy about having the worst contests ever given to Russell Wilson. This is going to give, this is [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1854.16s)]
*  going to make, why can't you just bench him? Why can't he just be the backup? Well, I, because I [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1858.48s)]
*  think the owner who gave him the deal, now you got to go walk up to the, because the owners blamed [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1863.1200000000001s)]
*  everybody else. You fired Alex Van Pelt. I mean, think about this. Joe Flacco throws for 1616 yards [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1867.04s)]
*  in five games. Watson throws for 1100 in six games. It wasn't the offense that was broken. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1873.2s)]
*  Our job is to figure out players, coaches, or scheme in any sport. To me, that's how you do [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1881.84s)]
*  an autopsy on a team. Is it the players? Is it the coaches? Is it the scheme? Okay. It's easier in [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1888.1599999999999s)]
*  the NBA because it's usually relative to the players, but sometimes the schemes don't work. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1893.04s)]
*  But to me, that's where they made the biggest mistake. They're saying the scheme was wrong [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1898.32s)]
*  for Deshaun. So we have to run a different scheme. Well, look now what you get. I mean, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1902.8s)]
*  that wasn't even played for the NBA. What's he good at? Like what scheme is right for him? [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1906.8s)]
*  I don't know what his skills are anymore. I will fully confess. I was a Deshaun Watson fan coming [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1910.56s)]
*  out of college. He was good in Houston. When he had Will Fuller, he threw the deep ball as well as [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1915.04s)]
*  anybody in the league. But I think, which we don't ever talk about, but I think money can spoil [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1919.44s)]
*  your appetite. I mean, he's a very wealthy man. I don't care how many more lawsuits he gets against [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1925.68s)]
*  them. He's made so much money. I don't know if he has the same hunger and the same desire to prove [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1931.2s)]
*  that he can come back from it. You listen to his press conference, he took it, but there's no energy [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1937.2s)]
*  in the guy. There's nothing. And now he's got this other suit with this. He's got a video attached [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1942.16s)]
*  to it. I mean, you know, and if he has another one after he's been suspended, how do they not [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1946.96s)]
*  suspend him for another year? Well, I see. So there's a few things going on, but you made the [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1953.2s)]
*  key point, but just going backwards, his arm doesn't seem as explosive. He doesn't seem as [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1958.56s)]
*  fearless anymore. I don't think he seems as fast as he was four years ago. So those are three things. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1964.48s)]
*  But then the other piece that you just mentioned, the quarterback is the leader of the team. They [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1970.24s)]
*  have to be the coolest guy in the huddle. They have to be the guy that galvanizes everybody up, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1975.92s)]
*  that lifts you up, that, you know, they're the pilot with the plane going like this and they're [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1980.3200000000002s)]
*  the guys making you feel safe. And I'm only watching on my TV, but when I watch him, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1984.8000000000002s)]
*  he just doesn't seem like he gives a shit. And I can only judge what I see from the replays and how [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1989.92s)]
*  he's interacting with people. But to me, he just doesn't seem like he really cares. And when your [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=1995.92s)]
*  quarterback's bad and also doesn't seem like he really cares, I don't know how that's sustainable. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2000.8000000000002s)]
*  Well, I thought the same thing with Zach Wilson. I think he cared last year. I think he thought it [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2005.52s)]
*  was, you know, it never felt important to me with Zach Wilson. Like it was just too hard. It was too [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2009.44s)]
*  hard to do the homework. It was too hard. Look, I think the first quarter down in Jacksonville [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2014.64s)]
*  might be the biggest quarter for the Cleveland Browns football ever, because I agree with you. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2019.92s)]
*  I mean, Kevin Stefanski will not be able to have any authority within that team if he lets this [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2024.08s)]
*  guy continue to play shitty and those guys on defense are playing really good. Now we know [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2029.68s)]
*  this about Cleveland's defense. The numbers are staggering the difference between what they did [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2034.4s)]
*  at home and what they did on the road. I mean, they gave up 3000 yards on the road. They gave up [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2039.6000000000001s)]
*  like 1100 at home. I mean, it's just like ridiculous. But, you know, and of course they've [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2043.68s)]
*  got Doug on the other sideline, which can help them as he was in Miami the other day. Forth down Doug. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2048.1600000000003s)]
*  Let's go for it. What the hell. For what reason? For what reason could you possibly explain that? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2054.0s)]
*  But not to lose track here, but I think that's first quarter is so damn important because [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2059.84s)]
*  if he doesn't come out and play good and he comes out and throws like he's been nosedive balls into [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2065.2000000000003s)]
*  the dirt, they have no run game. I mean, their offensive line is a mess because of the injuries, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2070.4s)]
*  but they have no run game. And you think Amari Cooper is going to be happy? You think, you know, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2076.6400000000003s)]
*  Jerry Judy is going to be happy? When their offensive line is banged up. I mean, it's still [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2081.44s)]
*  not a hundred percent. Look, the owner runs the team, right? He won. I've worked there. He, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2085.84s)]
*  he made the trade. He took responsibility for it. Can't fire himself, but this is a hole that's hard [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2091.44s)]
*  to dig out of. It's really a hole to hard to dig out of. And Stefanski, I don't think he's one of [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2097.28s)]
*  the four best coaches in the league, but I think he's in the top 10. I think he's done the stuff [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2102.4s)]
*  he's done. Yeah. The stuff he's done compared to the talent he's had and the situation has been. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2108.08s)]
*  And I think him and Kevin O'Connell, the two Kevins have been good. Right. And look, I mean, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2112.72s)]
*  he didn't want to fire Alex Van Pelt. He didn't want to make all these changes on his offensive [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2117.68s)]
*  staff. I don't know if it was Jimmy or D Haslam or if it was, if it was Paul DiPodesto, but somebody [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2121.7599999999998s)]
*  else is running it. Look, they've got a lot of people, they got a lot of people trying to run [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2127.04s)]
*  the team that may not really understand football because they're so based on analytics. And this [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2130.96s)]
*  is where you get caught is what your question was. If you don't understand football and you don't [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2136.48s)]
*  understand the locker room and you don't understand the impact of a guy who can't lead, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2141.04s)]
*  then you don't understand how you're going to win. That's really the issue. You can't figure out how [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2145.7599999999998s)]
*  to win. And somehow we talked about the Sean and all the football stuff and didn't even talk about [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2149.6s)]
*  all the lawsuits and the off the field stuff, which is yet another reason this is such a disaster. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2154.24s)]
*  You mentioned the Jaguars. So I had six week one teams. I mentioned earlier about week one, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2158.8s)]
*  it could go either way in week two, but then after week two, you look back and you go, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2166.32s)]
*  oh, now that makes sense from week one. I had the Jaguars. I bet on the Jaguars. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2170.48s)]
*  They actually covered the three and a half. I thought they played really well for three quarters [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2177.1200000000003s)]
*  and I actually think that might be good. And I think the result of that game was stupid. Now [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2182.48s)]
*  we're taping this for Miami Buffalo tonight, but if ETN just runs in the end zone, they're up 24 seven, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2186.4s)]
*  the game's over. I thought their defense was good. I think they have a lot of talent. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2192.08s)]
*  And I'm not willing to basically admit I was wrong in the Jaguars because I thought they'd be a 10 win [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2198.24s)]
*  team. Isn't this line has like been basically two and a half and now it's at three. Was it three and [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2204.0s)]
*  a half for a second? Now it's Jaguars three, but are the Jaguars good? I think they are. I mean, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2210.08s)]
*  you know, I think they really are. No, Lawrence is really good in the first half. They threw it down [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2217.2s)]
*  the field better than he ever had. You know, they turned it over. Doug makes some wonderful [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2220.96s)]
*  questionable decisions, but I think Ryan Nielsen, the new defensive coordinator was good in Atlanta. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2225.68s)]
*  Think about Atlanta, right? Last year, Atlanta had no pass rush whatsoever. Couldn't create turnovers, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2230.56s)]
*  but he was third in the league and third down defense. That's really good with no pass rush. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2235.92s)]
*  He was fourth in the league in red zone defense. So he kept you out of the end zone and he kept, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2240.96s)]
*  and he kept got off the field on third down. I think he did a really good job. I know he gave [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2245.76s)]
*  up a lot of yards to him and he gave up the big play to Tyreek Hill, but I thought they played [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2249.68s)]
*  them really well. But who else scores on that Tyreek touchdown? I mean, that was a fucking [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2253.44s)]
*  miracle. He does a 90 degree angle down the sideline. It's impossible. He's unbelievable. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2258.56s)]
*  He's the best receiver in football and he's the scariest one. So I think to me there's something, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2265.6s)]
*  fish this line at three and that Jet Tennessee line are the two ones that look too easy. They [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2271.68s)]
*  just look too easy because I think a lot of people, I think a lot of people still like [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2279.12s)]
*  Cleveland. I don't think they see the Deshaun Watson thing. I think there's people out there [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2284.4s)]
*  that are just going to assume that, Oh, he had a bad game. He'll play better this week. And I think [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2288.3199999999997s)]
*  his career is over. I really do. I like Dallas last week for this reason. Everybody was talking [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2291.92s)]
*  about all the problems in Dallas, but they were all contract issues, right? That doesn't really [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2298.96s)]
*  affect. The problems were in Cleveland. They got new offensive coordinator. They got a defense [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2304.64s)]
*  that doesn't play well on the road, right? They got a quarterback who can't make a throw. I mean, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2310.4s)]
*  there were more issues with them and it proved to be the truth, right? It's the same thing. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2314.72s)]
*  Cleveland's defense, this is the anomaly you'll never really understand. Cleveland's defense was [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2318.72s)]
*  the number one defense in the National Football League on third down. They were 32nd in the red [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2324.4s)]
*  zone. So if you got the ball in the red zone on them, you scored. And so how does those two things [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2328.48s)]
*  come together? I think to me, I thought I was never buying in on Cleveland. I think to me, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2334.0s)]
*  there was going to be a regression to the mean, especially defensively the way they played on the [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2340.16s)]
*  road. And I thought Dallas was, you're getting to the line moved all Dallas is the favorite end up [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2344.48s)]
*  being the dog in the game. I think, I think Jacksonville should be, you know, I think it [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2350.32s)]
*  should be a three and a half game. That's what I think it should be. But I think if you get it, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2355.12s)]
*  a three, you got to take Jacksonville. I had more to do on these week one, week two teams, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2360.72s)]
*  but I forgot to ask you why don't the judge just sign Hassan Reddick? What's the point of this? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2368.24s)]
*  I was told last week he was going to go in by a lot of people that don't. And he stood to make [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2374.64s)]
*  14 minutes, the dumbest holdout since Levi Anbel. And then he didn't show up. Like I think this is [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2379.9199999999996s)]
*  one of those where his agency, whoever they are, and they're not, they're not getting along. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2384.24s)]
*  Like they can't talk sense into the kid because anybody, if you represented them, you would be [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2390.32s)]
*  able to say, look, you're giving away money. You have one year left on a contract, go in, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2395.1200000000003s)]
*  get 12 sacks and we'll get to the market next year and you'll make $70 million. Like why are [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2399.6000000000004s)]
*  we giving money back to them? And now, you know, he's not coming in unless he gets money. Now it's [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2404.8s)]
*  a principal thing for him. It's a dumbest holdout since Levi Anbel. So it's wasn't actually business. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2410.32s)]
*  It became personal. He forgot one of the biggest rules of the Godfather. What's he doing? [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2417.36s)]
*  Joe Douglas trades for this guy and doesn't have the contract worked out. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2425.36s)]
*  Like he was one thing, give rid of credit. I think it's a dumbest holdout of all time. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2428.6400000000003s)]
*  But one thing, give rid of credit is he was very clear with what he wanted. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2432.32s)]
*  You know, now nothing says I'm sorry better than money. We know this, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2436.48s)]
*  but the jets don't want to say they're sorry. They're not giving them money. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2441.28s)]
*  See, I think Levi Anbel's contract was dumber because the running back shelf life we already [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2444.96s)]
*  knew at that point was pretty short to begin with. And it's like, you have this many years to make [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2450.16s)]
*  money. So I talked about that week one, week two conundrum. The number one game for this is New [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2454.56s)]
*  England Cincinnati week one. Cause there's a version of that game that Cincinnati just sucked. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2458.96s)]
*  Right. They didn't play well. They, if they score and make it seven, seven in the second quarter, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2465.52s)]
*  they probably end up winning. New England was able to run the ball really well. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2471.04s)]
*  They blocked for some reason, which nobody expected. Most of all me, you know, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2475.76s)]
*  they replaced their left tackle in the first quarter and all of a sudden the right side of [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2479.6s)]
*  the line looked like the early nineties Cowboys. And they only scored 16 points and they won anyway, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2484.64s)]
*  but it felt convincing. And it's like, you know what, we'll look back at that and be like, man, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2491.12s)]
*  that was a dumb game. There's another scenario where the, where the, where the pats might actually [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2494.32s)]
*  be pretty frisky and a little discount 2001 Patriots ish, where just a defense where now that [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2499.44s)]
*  they actually do have a pass rush, which I don't think either of us thought they were going to have [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2507.92s)]
*  without Barmore and Judon, but it seemed like they had one combined with the back seven, which is [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2510.88s)]
*  really good in the strength of the team and an ability to run the ball, which nobody was expecting. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2516.56s)]
*  And everybody seems to be playing hard for Mayo, which you can feel it from the quotes and you can [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2521.6s)]
*  feel from the postgame stuff. And maybe they're decent, which makes me think maybe the Bengals are [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2526.16s)]
*  okay, but there's another scenario where the Seattle waxes the pats this week. And then we're [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2532.08s)]
*  like, Oh, the Bengals aren't okay because Seattle just killed the Patriots. So where do you stand? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2538.96s)]
*  How's it going to play out? Well, I think the Patriots have one way to play and the way they [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2543.68s)]
*  played on Sunday was exactly the only way they can play. They've got to play from the front. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2547.7599999999998s)]
*  They've got to run the ball and they've got to hope their defense can hold up. Now they got a [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2551.3599999999997s)]
*  big break. Cincinnati's offensive line, our Trent Brown guy at right tackle was a disaster. He did [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2555.28s)]
*  not play well. Joe, look, Zach Taylor, I don't understand it, but the guys now he's 0 and 5 and [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2560.32s)]
*  open in the first two weeks of the season, the last two years. I mean, he never gets his team ready to [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2566.8s)]
*  play. I mean, as much, and I thought he was better this summer in terms of playing people, but they're [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2571.44s)]
*  never ready. Like that game was all about the first quarter. If you don't play for, if you're [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2577.0400000000004s)]
*  Cincinnati and you don't score on the first drive and make the Patriots have to go put the ball in [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2581.44s)]
*  for Seth's hands for 40 times, they're going to keep them in the game and then they're going to [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2587.92s)]
*  build some confidence and momentum and then you're going to be in trouble. They didn't get a first [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2591.6800000000003s)]
*  down in the first quarter. They didn't get a first down in the first quarter. Forget about scoring. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2595.52s)]
*  So I agree if they would have scored on that play, it probably would have given them some life. But [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2599.28s)]
*  look, I think every game will be a struggle for the Patriots. I think Seattle, their offensive [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2603.2000000000003s)]
*  line is not very good. They lost their tackle. The one thing that is good is New England's got a [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2608.8s)]
*  powerful defensive front. They can push people back. They'll create a problem for Seattle. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2613.92s)]
*  If Kenneth Walker's not healthy, which it sounds like he's not, that's an issue too. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2618.6400000000003s)]
*  So I think they're going to be frisky in games. I don't think they're going to be 10 point dogs [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2622.5600000000004s)]
*  at the time. Not a three and a half point dogs, three point dogs here. I think they're frisky [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2628.5600000000004s)]
*  enough to where they'll play because they're good enough to play on defense. And if you don't [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2633.1200000000003s)]
*  understand how you have to play them, like if I'm Seattle, I'm saying everything we got to score, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2636.56s)]
*  we got to score on. We got to get in front of these guys, make Percent beat us. But if you don't do [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2642.96s)]
*  that, like Zach Taylor obviously didn't do it. And then they ran the ball. See to me, Cincinnati, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2649.92s)]
*  they couldn't stop the run. They missed DJ Reed badly. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2655.2799999999997s)]
*  I agree with that. And I saw the chase thing, the holdout and burrow with the sand. All the [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2659.44s)]
*  vibes are off on that team. They offer chase according to the reports today, which I think [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2665.92s)]
*  is true. And I've heard this could be true. They offered him 35 a year with like 90 guaranteed. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2671.2000000000003s)]
*  And he turned it down because he said he wants way more than Jefferson. Well, now you're being [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2675.84s)]
*  unreasonable. Like the market is the market. And if the Browns, if the Brown family is willing to [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2680.32s)]
*  pay you the market, that's why the Brown family said enough of this shit, you're out. You know, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2684.8s)]
*  we're done. We're not doing anymore. We've offered you the best deal we can. You turn that down, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2689.12s)]
*  you go on your own. We still own you. We have your rights for four more years. We have this [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2692.96s)]
*  year, we have the 50 year option and we have two franchise years. So the Pats and the Chargers [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2696.8s)]
*  look very similar to being week one and the Chargers have a more proven coach, but same [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2702.4s)]
*  kind of recipe, right? Let's try to get the lead. Let's try to establish the run and keep running, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2707.44s)]
*  keep running. And then we can throw out a position of strength. Let's fly around on defense. I thought [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2713.76s)]
*  that Chargers defense, especially in the second half of that game, was pretty good. We also have [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2719.6s)]
*  no idea how bad the Raiders are. I guess we're going to find out. Minchu did have his complete. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2724.3199999999997s)]
*  He completed like 80% of his passes. So it's not like they weren't moving the ball, but I thought [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2728.4s)]
*  that Chargers- Antonio Pierce goes for it. If he goes for it on fourth down, maybe they, and doesn't [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2733.6s)]
*  call like an inside zone play and get stuffed. Maybe he would have been in it. I don't think [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2738.3199999999997s)]
*  the Chargers look very good. I thought Herbert was probably the most disappointing player of week one [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2743.36s)]
*  that I've seen. Yeah. Well, they only scored 22 points was a little similar to the Pats. Like they [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2747.44s)]
*  did just enough to win, but that was another game where I'm like, I think the Raiders are bad, but [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2754.4s)]
*  maybe the Chargers are also better than people think. But yeah, I mean, who's he throwing to? [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2761.2000000000003s)]
*  Like Palmer is questionable for this week. Scott McConkey, the rookie, but you know, the last year [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2766.08s)]
*  he seems like he was a bust. Yeah. They have no skill. They don't have a tight end. They can get [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2771.2000000000003s)]
*  it, make a play. I think, look, if you had any guts, you'd take Carolina and the six at home. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2777.12s)]
*  I don't have enough guts to do that. I mean, that's what separates me from the betting world [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2782.24s)]
*  because I look at that strictly as like there's, you know, but the number is the number. Like I [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2786.88s)]
*  think Carolina is so shitty and Bryce Young, he's now played seven, he's played 18 games now, [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2792.56s)]
*  and he hasn't shown that he's got any ability to come out of it. And the Raiders can rush. I mean, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2796.88s)]
*  the Raiders, you know, Max Scrobsby is a problem. So, you know, excuse me, I'm sorry, the Mac can [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2801.68s)]
*  rush and they've got the defensive front. You know, so I don't trust the Chargers because they [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2809.2799999999997s)]
*  didn't have any state to get open. Wow, Harbaugh's your guy. I'm surprised you don't trust them. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2817.68s)]
*  I love Harbaugh. I think to me, he's got to play a certain way. You know that he's got to play like [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2821.68s)]
*  the Patriots, but their skill is terrible. I was disappointed with Herbert. He didn't make any [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2825.6s)]
*  throw. Every score they had was off a big run. I wonder how many teams this year are the, if we [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2830.72s)]
*  can just take a lead heading into halftime, we can probably win. But if we fall behind by 10, we're [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2837.12s)]
*  dead. It seems like we have more teams than usual this year that qualify for that. That's the lead, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2842.16s)]
*  though. Why was Dallas so good last year? They had a plus 124 point differential. They went into [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2847.04s)]
*  halftime with a 124 point lead. Any team, look, when we do this podcast in January, the teams [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2852.3199999999997s)]
*  that are first half point differential and the advantage, who are the top four teams in that [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2858.4s)]
*  category, are going to be the winners. It's style of play, right? The teams are, there are a lot of, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2862.4s)]
*  most of the teams are somewhat even. There's obviously better teams, but if you can play a [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2867.92s)]
*  certain style, this is why basketball, you learn so much watching basketball for NFL because if you [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2872.48s)]
*  listen to the college basketball coaches, they'll say, if we play this game in the sixties, we have [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2878.1600000000003s)]
*  a chance. If we play it the eighties, we can't win. College coaches understand style of play. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2882.0s)]
*  Some of the NFL coaches, Zach Taylor, you know, some of these guys, they don't understand, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2887.68s)]
*  they just run their stuff. They just run their stuff. They don't understand that it's a three [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2891.8399999999997s)]
*  dimensional game and you got to play a certain style. If New England doesn't play a style, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2895.2s)]
*  say, say Seattle gets the opening kick, scores a touchdown, say New England fumbles, they pick it [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2900.24s)]
*  up, they scoop and score. Now they're down 14 to nothing. You know, now it's a different game. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2904.96s)]
*  You can't be as patient. Did the Bears defense change your mind at all about the ceiling of [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2909.44s)]
*  that team? Cause you and I are both laughing during the summer about that over under was eight [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2915.92s)]
*  and a half heavy, heavy action on the eight and a half. People go nuts about Caleb, them putting [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2920.32s)]
*  together this pass first three receiver offense that as soon as it gets cold is going to make [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2926.08s)]
*  no sense at all. And yet their defense look good. Well, I played Will Leves. I mean, he missed two [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2931.6s)]
*  guys. They had a guy wide open in the end zone for a touchdown. I mean, the guy's sitting there like [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2938.0s)]
*  he was going to fair catch the ball. It took forever for him to get it to him. That's a [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2942.48s)]
*  touchdown there. He had other guys wide open. They ran the ball on the Bears defense. I mean, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2946.08s)]
*  look, the Bears are soft that you're not running that offense that the Bears are trying to run [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2950.96s)]
*  in Chicago when it gets cold. I mean, Tennessee kicked their ass up front. If you and I sat down [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2955.84s)]
*  and watched the all 22 of that game, Tennessee kicked their ass up front. I have a problem. I [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2960.96s)]
*  think the Bears are be good on the, I mean, they're play smart, all that, but they're going to turn [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2965.6s)]
*  that was Leves related. I think everything. Look, Tennessee ran the ball when Leves, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2970.88s)]
*  when he took Leves away from it and he could hand the ball off, Tennessee's offense was actually [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2975.6800000000003s)]
*  better. I couldn't even complete a screen half the time. My last one would woods. And we don't know [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2980.0s)]
*  the answer to the Buffalo side of this because we're taping before the Thursday night game, but [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2986.08s)]
*  I thought the cards offense looked good and people were making a big deal after about how Kyler wasn't [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2990.0s)]
*  thrown at long. And, but I just thought he had control of the game. Harrison had a shit game and [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2994.4s)]
*  they barely went to him when they went to him, we dropped a pretty big pass, but they were moving [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=2999.84s)]
*  the ball that whole game. And, and if Buffalo is actually a playoff team and I'm still not sure, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3004.2400000000002s)]
*  but I was impressed. I actually thought they were going to come down. I thought the guy got [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3010.6400000000003s)]
*  interfered with on the last play. And I thought they had a chance to steal it. So they're playing [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3013.6000000000004s)]
*  this Rams team this weekend that, you know, has already had just a shitload of injuries. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3018.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm afraid to go against McVeigh, but they, when your offensive line's decimated, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3025.7599999999998s)]
*  you don't have Aaron Donald anymore. The, the Pook has already gone, you know, and he's just like, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3030.16s)]
*  what's the point of no return for injuries? They're kind of almost there. And I feel like the [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3036.48s)]
*  cards could steal it, but yet everyone's like, well, McVeigh owns Arizona. Do you believe in the coach [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3040.3999999999996s)]
*  owns franchise blank? Yeah. And I think when you have all these injuries that he has, he can game [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3046.16s)]
*  plan around it. Now he's got four offensive linemen. He had to bring guys in. I thought [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3051.92s)]
*  Stafford was really good last week. I think he took a beat and he made throws. I mean, look, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3055.92s)]
*  if you're going to give me a point and Sean and to keep Sean McVeigh from going on to, I'll take [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3059.92s)]
*  the point. I believe in game plan. I think that Arizona defense is atrocious. You know, I know, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3065.2000000000003s)]
*  I think to me and Stafford will make enough plays. Cooper Cup could still make plays. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3072.0s)]
*  So, uh, look, I, I don't know to me, I think Buffalo is an average team with a great quarterback. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3076.64s)]
*  And I don't think you should ever, ever deviate from that. I think they're a very average team [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3083.12s)]
*  with a great quarterback. I think Miami will do a lot of tonight. Here's where I think the advantage [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3087.6s)]
*  is for Miami tonight, Jordan Poirier. So Miami has Jordan Poirier on their team. He knows everything [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3092.8799999999997s)]
*  about Buffalo's defense from chapter to verse. He's going to help them. I mean, they're going [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3098.24s)]
*  to run some stuff that Buffalo's not used to seeing that's going to attack Buffalo. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3102.32s)]
*  If Miami doesn't win this game, they're never going to be the good team. And I'm not sure [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3106.1600000000003s)]
*  Buffalo is a good team. Even if Miami wins, I'm like, I'm not going to acquiesce and say, [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3110.4s)]
*  Oh, finally they beat a good team. So do you believe in the coach owns franchise [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3113.84s)]
*  blank? Cause I never believed it until I felt like the Patriots were going to beat Buffalo, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3119.28s)]
*  no matter who was on Buffalo's team for, with the entire time we had Brady was just like, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3123.6000000000004s)]
*  we're never losing to Buffalo ever. Yeah. They would have lost to Buffalo. I mean, [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3127.6800000000003s)]
*  look, they got Josh Allen. So that changes the dynamic. But I think for 20 years, I was just [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3131.44s)]
*  saying, mark those two wins down. We own Buffalo. You know, I think to me, Sean understands certain [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3136.32s)]
*  games. They're comfortable playing. There is a comfort level of play in there. I think Sean's [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3142.08s)]
*  really good coach and you give him a week to game plan when he knows he doesn't have this player or [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3146.48s)]
*  that player. It's hard when you do it on the game, that left tackle that they put in against Detroit [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3151.6s)]
*  was so bad. That poor kid had no chance to play. And yet they still work. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3156.96s)]
*  It's like a third stringer, right? [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3161.2s)]
*  Yeah. And still they got the game in overtime. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3162.64s)]
*  Are you with me on the Stalers just in general? [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3166.08s)]
*  I think if you like ugly football and you like Mike Tomlin like I do, yeah. I mean, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3169.28s)]
*  I regretted not, I didn't take them on the Russo contest, but to me, they did exactly what they had [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3174.2400000000002s)]
*  to do to win the game. They ran the football. I said this on my, I said this on Monday and [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3180.32s)]
*  Arthur Smith confirmed it today. But here's when you know you've got a good coach. Arthur [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3184.64s)]
*  Smith was not going to let Justin Fields throw the ball in the middle field. He was never going to [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3191.2s)]
*  let him throw it. He threw it all outside the numbers. And so because he didn't want Jesse [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3195.2799999999997s)]
*  Bates making a play. So they took away their best player. Meanwhile, for some reason, the Super [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3199.3599999999997s)]
*  Bowl winning champion, Atlanta Falcons decided that TJ Watt wasn't going to play in the game. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3204.96s)]
*  So they didn't worry about him. And he just destroyed the game. I mean, look, I'm worried [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3209.52s)]
*  about Cousins. I don't know what you thought, but I was worried about Cousins. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3213.52s)]
*  And I'm- What do you mean what did I thought? I thought he was a statue. He could move. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3216.96s)]
*  I mean, that offensive line is not any good in Atlanta. They're not. They can't pass protect. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3222.08s)]
*  McCrary got his ass kicked. This week against Philly, they'll be challenged. So I think all [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3227.7599999999998s)]
*  those people that bought tickets for Atlanta to win the Super Bowl, you might want to think about [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3232.48s)]
*  selling them if you can. It would be hilarious if Penex turned out to be a great pick because [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3236.0s)]
*  Cousins wasn't healthy. Or Cousins. The Cousins signing was bad, but Penex made like, all right, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3241.44s)]
*  we at least salvage it with the Penex side trade. If it's your 100 million in the hole, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3248.08s)]
*  you're 100 million in the hole. Well, that was just like what 25% of the teams are just, [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3251.84s)]
*  they're playing with like 80% of a salary cap. All right. That's it for football. We have two [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3257.36s)]
*  other topics for you. One, have you talked yourself into the new big three of Joel Embiid, [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3262.56s)]
*  Paul George and Tyrese Maxey yet? I'm not going down. I'm not getting talked into that. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3268.48s)]
*  It'll be February before I'm ever going to be convinced of that. I'm just not going there. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3275.76s)]
*  I'm not. What part scares you the most? Is it the injury factor? Is it the sacrifice? [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3280.48s)]
*  They have no mental toughness as a team. You can't be a championship team without mental [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3286.64s)]
*  toughness. And if your best player has zero mental toughness, how are you going to be a [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3292.56s)]
*  championship team? He's a gold medalist. Yeah. Thanks to the guy who put his team on his back [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3296.96s)]
*  and said, fellas, just get the fuck out of the way. I'm going to win the same way now. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3303.84s)]
*  Great players play great when greatness is needed. That's what he was. I'm not going, look, [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3309.2s)]
*  I know I've been down this road and they pull me back in. I'm not going down the road. I can't. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3314.0s)]
*  I'm not. It's just, I know the outcome of this. Like I've seen it. There's no toughness. I believe [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3318.96s)]
*  in toughness. I believe in championship character. I believe in hard work. All those things that [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3324.56s)]
*  Brady echoed at his hall of fame speech. I believe in, and that hasn't changed since time in Memorial. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3330.4s)]
*  So I don't understand how they're going to win. I don't care what pieces, you know, I mean, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3336.4s)]
*  I appreciate them signing that French guy because he was tough, but the team's not tough. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3342.24s)]
*  You know what's funny? You always complain about your friend, Big Daddy, the Packers fan. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3346.96s)]
*  Who's just always glass half, to say he's glass half full would be an understatement. He's glass [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3351.52s)]
*  like 5% full. But you're kind of the big daddy of the Sixers. That's who you've turned into. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3357.44s)]
*  Only because I don't like the star player. I just don't buy into him. If he were gone [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3364.08s)]
*  and they had other people, I would be more enthusiastic. I'm usually, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3370.24s)]
*  I am usually, it's why Belichick and I got along so good. I'm usually Mr. Positive and he was Mr. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3374.24s)]
*  Negative. And so we kind of met in the middle a little bit. I'm typically really, I'm the happy [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3378.96s)]
*  scout. I'm not the miserable scout. You know, like some scouts are, this guy's no good. Well, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3383.6s)]
*  he's going to the hall of fame. Oh, he's not good. But this guy has destroyed me forever because of [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3387.6s)]
*  the media perception about him. And nobody's willing to say he is not in shape. Nobody's willing to [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3394.48s)]
*  say he could be great if he would get in shape. Nobody's willing to criticize them. They all buy [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3400.16s)]
*  his, you know, oh yeah, I'm a star, you know, like win a championship. Show me that you really care. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3405.6s)]
*  How about make round three? How about make round three? How about care? [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3411.12s)]
*  I really like him. I just want to say I really like him be the person. And I don't understand [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3415.52s)]
*  why he, why he doesn't understand the get in shape piece of this, which makes me almost think his [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3420.72s)]
*  body is like breaking down and he's holding on for dear life. Let me ask you this question. What are [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3425.7599999999998s)]
*  the chances that he's healthy April 1st of next year? I would honestly say 50 50. Yeah, I think [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3430.48s)]
*  there's a 50% chance. All right. And what's the chances that he's in shape in May 1st of next year? [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3438.0s)]
*  But you and I were both old. Like we know what happens with centers as they get older and they [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3444.32s)]
*  put weight on them. Guess what happens? They get hurt. That's how it goes. You hit your thirties, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3449.2s)]
*  pull a weight here, a little weight there. Now all of a sudden my knee, I got tendonitis and [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3454.8s)]
*  Oh my back. So this was the last four or five years of Shaq's career. He just put out, he by [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3459.84s)]
*  and people be like, Oh no, Shaq made the All-Star team and no way. Like Shaq was a completely [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3466.32s)]
*  different guy the last five, six, seven years of his career than, you know, where he started. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3470.56s)]
*  So you asked me am I negative? I just see the future. I know where this train's coming. There's [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3475.6800000000003s)]
*  another train. You know what's funny though? You didn't even mention the Paul George piece of [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3480.08s)]
*  month in where the first, the first story like sources say Paul George is unhappy. He's standing [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3484.8s)]
*  in the corner so much on offense for Philly. Wish he had the ball more. Cause Maxey's great. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3490.48s)]
*  Everyone loves Maxey. I love Maxey. I'm all in on Maxey, but here's where I think this could be. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3495.2000000000003s)]
*  I could, if I were prosecuting the in-be love affair in a court, I would call the dream team [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3500.56s)]
*  as my witnesses because as great as that team was, he really couldn't even play with that team. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3507.28s)]
*  So all this conversation about, well, he just needs the right pieces around them [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3512.72s)]
*  is bullshit because he was playing on the greatest assemblance of basketball players [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3517.2799999999997s)]
*  in the world and he still couldn't play on that team. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3522.16s)]
*  I guess I have two more things. You're doing a pod with Belichick who's, I mean, he's on like seven [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3526.64s)]
*  shows. He went from one word answers in a press conference to if he just put a mic in front of [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3531.6s)]
*  him, he's talking. But what D, it just seems like he's getting a complete kick out of this whole [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3538.24s)]
*  thing. Like it's like he said, all this stuff bottled up forever. Yeah. I think what he really [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3544.16s)]
*  loves, we're doing this thing called the encyclopedia on YouTube too, where we're going [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3549.2s)]
*  to do a weekly pod that we're going to, he and I are going to look back on this week. I think [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3554.4799999999996s)]
*  Matt, Patricia and him are going to look ahead. But the one thing we're all doing is we're doing [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3558.56s)]
*  what we call the library, the encyclopedia. So we're doing a bunch of different things on [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3562.88s)]
*  the hall of fame. We're doing things on evaluation, the process of building a team, all that stuff. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3568.96s)]
*  And then we're going to put that in the library on the YouTube. And that he really, I mean, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3574.8s)]
*  that's where his, he loves that. I mean, that's where he kind of comes throughout and he enjoys [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3578.96s)]
*  it. And I think to me, the way he's approached it, he's working as hard as ever. He's in NFL films [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3583.6s)]
*  for three days. He's watching tape, you know, and I can't believe somebody wouldn't call him next [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3590.08s)]
*  off season, but I think he's prepared as if, no, because of his age and maybe nobody would call. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3595.84s)]
*  I got to have a career after this. I think the complete opposite. I think this is a six month [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3600.48s)]
*  sprint until February and he's getting a job. I mean, it's going to be like nine jobs open as always [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3606.4s)]
*  and he'll be ready and he stayed in the limelight and he's, this was all really smart. But Bill, [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3612.08s)]
*  when you finished third in the Atlanta Falcons selection, you weren't even in their top three [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3616.88s)]
*  in the selection committee. I mean, you know, it's hard. It's, you know, it's hard, but I do [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3621.52s)]
*  think that there's, there's going to be some, there is definitely a gap between, like I did today. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3626.48s)]
*  I wrote, I'm writing a column for tomorrow. I borrowed one of your great things was [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3632.6400000000003s)]
*  what, like what team has no chance. And there's like eight teams right now that have no chance. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3636.7200000000003s)]
*  Like you could eliminate eight teams from ever thinking about their going to the playoffs. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3642.32s)]
*  Eight right now. That's a lot of teams. Yeah. And we, one, I don't think I'm wrong on any of them. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3646.4s)]
*  Do you think Arizona has a chance? Do you think the Raiders have a chance? Do you think Washington [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3654.0s)]
*  has a chance? The Giants have a chance. You know, do you think Tennessee has a chance? You know, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3659.12s)]
*  do you think Carolina that's six, Denver seven? So you talk about cross-off teams. Yeah. There's [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3665.36s)]
*  Sal and I always try to do one a week and we did for after week one, we did two. We're like [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3669.84s)]
*  Carolina and the Giants cross-offs done. I give it, I'm going to give you eight. Now I, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3674.16s)]
*  I don't know if I put Denver in there because Denver has no chance to win the super bowl, [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3679.3599999999997s)]
*  but Denver's going to improve. But I'm talking about teams that have no chance at all. Like [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3683.04s)]
*  Tennessee has no chance. They're kidding themselves. Just like the Giants are kidding themselves. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3686.96s)]
*  Washington's got a young quarterback, but their team sucks. I mean, there's all different scenarios, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3691.92s)]
*  but has there ever been a time where eight teams, you could just eliminate and say they got no chance? [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3696.72s)]
*  Not after week one. And I honestly, I throwing, I would throw in Cleveland. I think that a Sean [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3702.24s)]
*  thing is, is a single handled league and it killed their season. I think Belichick's back in February. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3707.4399999999996s)]
*  That's my prediction. What happens first? Belichick is coaching again or Bob Kraft is [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3713.7599999999998s)]
*  in the hall of fame. I know you read that piece. I read that word for word. I mean, I've seen that. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3718.3999999999996s)]
*  I mean, you know, the try to deny that, that he had nothing to do with that documentary. Come on [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3724.72s)]
*  now. Let's not share. Well, I was waiting. Yeah. I worked with Alex Gibney and he's a great guy. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3729.12s)]
*  We did. Oh, it's up. That was my last one. So one episode last night, [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3735.44s)]
*  that's the same guy who did the documentary on the page. He's one of the, he's one of the great [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3743.52s)]
*  documentarians of all time. And I had heard that he was involved because it was in the press room. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3747.2799999999997s)]
*  They did a press release or came out that he was. And then all of a sudden, by the time the doc came [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3752.08s)]
*  out, he wasn't involved. And I was like, Oh, that I guarantee. Cause that guy doesn't, [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3756.24s)]
*  he did the end run doc. Like he doesn't fuck around with this stuff. So if it was like, [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3761.68s)]
*  this has to be a puff piece with Kraft, with final editorial control, that guy must've been like, [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3765.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm out. I don't know the story yet. You're going to find this hard to believe, but I truly believe [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3770.96s)]
*  because Kraft hired the greatest coach of all time. He belongs in the hall of fame. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3777.7599999999998s)]
*  I believe that whole, if Jerry Jones is in, Kraft should be in, but I think he's pushing for it too [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3781.76s)]
*  hard. That's my problem is like, just why are you trying to take credit for shit you didn't do? [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3787.5200000000004s)]
*  Like why not? If he would've gotten in, if it wasn't for him, Belichick and Brady wouldn't have [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3793.84s)]
*  been able to coexist for that long. Cause Kraft was just brokering the piece between them at all [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3798.0800000000004s)]
*  times. It was that acrimonious. Just take, just enjoy the six Superbowls. Like why? Like I think, [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3802.7200000000003s)]
*  I think he deserves to get in. I've said it before, but this, this egocentric drive to take [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3809.36s)]
*  credit for it, like you're the owner. Why do you need credit? Like you own the team. You saved the [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3816.8s)]
*  team. They were going to move. You saved them. You kept them in New England. I mean, Art Rooney, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3822.56s)]
*  you know, I mean, he went through all those years being, being banned at Pittsburgh. He didn't try [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3828.2400000000002s)]
*  to take credit for the Superbowls. He was generous and giving, whereas this guy's trying to take [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3832.32s)]
*  everything from him. Like that's what, to me, that's why he's not getting in. He's trying too hard. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3836.88s)]
*  Well, we're going to wrap up, but I, I, I'm stunned you haven't watched both episodes of [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3843.44s)]
*  The Sopranos Doc yet. I know it's first week of football, but it's an absolute outrage. I've [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3848.88s)]
*  already done a podcast two days ago with fantasy and Van Lathan about how great it was. I thought [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3853.12s)]
*  you were the number one Sopranos fan. Every rule you have is from The Sopranos and The Godfather. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3858.8s)]
*  You haven't watched The Sopranos Doc? I saw the one last night. I thought it was fabulous last [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3865.68s)]
*  night. In fact, the, the, the going through the, um, the auditions were, the auditions were [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3870.56s)]
*  tremendous, right? They were just tremendous. I didn't see an uncle junior audition, which was [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3877.04s)]
*  very disappointing. Like I would have loved to have seen that, but I mean, you talk about me being [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3880.7999999999997s)]
*  miserable. David Chase just lives a miserable life. Does he ever seem like he was happy? [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3886.24s)]
*  Get to part two. It, it part two, it really dives into that. Like basically him and Gandolfini and [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3890.88s)]
*  Soprano just merge into one miserable entity. So they get into it. Well, I'm excited for you to [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3897.52s)]
*  watch the rest of it. It's great. Uh, well, Lombardi, we can hear you all over the place, [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3902.56s)]
*  but especially the, uh, the GM Shuffle podcast, uh, coach on Belichick, find that on YouTube [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3906.8s)]
*  and VESA Morning Show. And, um, you're working hard. It's, uh, I always enjoy the content. Great [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3912.96s)]
*  to see you, my friend. Thank you, Bill. Appreciate you. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrMkRuYrhTo&t=3918.08s)]
