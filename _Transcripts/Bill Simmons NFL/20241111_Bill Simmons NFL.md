# NFL Guess the Lines Week 11 With Cousin Sal  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [November 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORHUBwpao3s)
*  Thursday night
*  Really good game
*  Eagles Eagles Washington. I would say this is probably the most exciting Thursday night game. We've had there's real stakes
*  divisions at stake
*  Washington could go from seven to two to seven and four and five days
*  Better hit it exactly because I did I
*  Was vacillating between two and a half and three and I went Eagles by two and a half good
*  It's a three and a half. Oh, it's what I have. Okay
*  Not trusting little hi, I
*  Guess they think maybe the Eagles can run on Washington
*  That's a tough spot for Jayden Daniels, right still on the road in division
*  You know, they they're not gonna take the Eagles by surprise that's for sure
*  Sunday marquee
*  It's a nice little seven point tease with Washington get them to ten and a half
*  Sunday marquee game chiefs bills game of the year so far probably right? Yes
*  So better better game since maybe chiefs Ravens week one lots of fun
*  So as I said earlier, I would add the bills by one or one and a half, but I think after today I just think the I
*  Just think the chiefs are gonna be favored
*  I just think the chiefs are gonna be favored. I just have chiefs minus one
*  Wait
*  What happened I had bills minus one and it's bills minus one and a half. What what did I don't even understand that logic
*  What did you see out of the chiefs that you love there was more what I saw from the bills
*  I feel like with the receivers
*  What it was receivers being out, I mean I feel like you got
*  Coleman didn't play I don't know guys are playing next Sunday, you know, they have tight ends
*  I can catch the ball that that Ray Davis guy. I feel like Alan like gets it done. He figures it out eventually
*  Zero touchdowns and two picks today
*  Yeah, all right
*  And they still so you're telling me I get to bet on Patrick Bahamas as an underdog again is what you're telling me
*  Well, that's great news
*  Because there's no better bet in sports and I'll be making it
*  Well, you should make it soon because I'm also telling you that the one and a half's have swung almost every time this year
*  So they could easily be giving one and a half. Well the move is a more he's them
*  Tease them right now with at least one game
*  Yeah, do it with your
*  beloved commanders
*  The watchables five watchables this week
*  Steelers home for the Baltimore Ravens. Mm-hmm. I
*  Think the Steelers are gonna be favored by one and a half. Oh wow
*  Hey off
*  What do you mean? Well, you'll love this in a teaser. I had Ravens by three. It's Ravens by three and a half
*  The fuck out of here, right? I'm right on that
*  Guarantee you're wrong. No, I guarantee I'm my instinct on what that line should be is the right instinct. Oh, that's stupid
*  See I thought the Steelers should be favored over Washington
*  But Washington was favored over the steel right the Baltimore's got a very big power
*  It was a good other dudes are back now
*  We'll see with Highsmith whether he's out for because he hurt his ankle in the foot. Yeah, you kind of need all hands on deck
*  Yeah, the Steelers were healthy until that happened, but well, they'll score. I mean, that's one thing with this Ravens man
*  Look out there's no shortage of points when you play them their defense stinks. Yep. I
*  Should say their past defense stinks I
*  Think you can
*  If you're within seven points of them in the last ten minutes of the game
*  You can go down the field and throw the ball and them over and over again and they can't stop it
*  That was a great that was a great Thursday game too. That was what yep
*  I just and Zach Taylor we we kill him a lot but go for two nice nice
*  Need a different play but that was a good decision. I thought it's good decision
*  I thought to put up that kind of offense without Higgins
*  Was really impressive and chase was obviously out of his mind but
*  Now they're good and chase Brown had that fumble and I just felt like
*  That was an either or game and the Bengals have somehow lost three of us. Sure. Yeah
*  I'm putting this in the watchables just because
*  Drake may for me is now just in the watchables category. It's it's uh, I'm in charge against the Lions
*  I could do whatever I want. That's true. I
*  Have the Rams at the Patriots
*  And I had the Rams favored by three and a half I said four and a half it is five and a half
*  I was just a little bit off there
*  Stop it Vegas
*  Wait, what was the line today?
*  That's stupid that crowd's gonna be you know, the Pats fans are in on Drake made like that. This would be a good crowd on Sunday
*  I know I'm saying I think there's real excitement about him now
*  Now that's too high I think that drops
*  Not a little
*  Jets Colts, I think has to be a watchables because this is
*  The Jets are kind of train wreck TV now, right? Mm-hmm
*  It's like when my wife watches below deck Australia
*  No, it's not a good show but weird shits happen in every episode. I feel like that's the jet. What is that shit?
*  What is that blow that you know the blow deck your wife doesn't watch below deck. No, I'm on the penguin right now
*  Block it's a reality show. It's like these people that work on
*  yachts and these people rent the yachts for a week so they have to
*  You know work for the people but it's all about like the under underneath the boat like all the relationships
*  They're all hooking up getting mad at each other
*  But then they have to deal with like these people that rented the boat for the week. My wife loves the show
*  That's fun. Are you buying another yacht? Is that what you'd say?
*  Another yacht well, do you have one and then this would be any yachts? All right
*  Come on I'm just joshing you're jashing I'm just jashing. Yeah
*  You're gonna get this one. Yeah, it's home for the Colts. I have the Jets minus two. Oh
*  All right. I had two and a half. It's three and a half
*  Come on. This is I haven't got one right yet. This is good
*  No, I'm up five nothing. This is a insurmountable
*  This poor it's usually a bad sign for my betting when I'm off on the lands like this
*  Well, how long how long are they gonna be in the Jets corner? These odds makers because this is a little bit silly
*  Yeah, I thought this would be the week when maybe they watched the Jets and saw that they gave up for 70 yard plus drives and
*  28 first downs and 57 plays and we're like, maybe this seems not good
*  Broncos home for the Falcons. This is like a an actual good game that I'm excited to watch who would have thought
*  Falcons by one and a half over the Broncos
*  This was Falcons one night. You get to think I'm screwing with you. It was Falcons one and a half
*  I said Denver minus one. It's Denver minus one and a half now. I
*  Promise that's how it went and they should be favored Denver should be favored
*  You know, they're better than Atlanta right now
*  I mean that they could have three less wins and it would totally make sense, right?
*  Last one Niner Seahawks
*  In San Francisco, I think this just absolutely pulsates at the Vegas zone
*  Now I'm gonna say Niners by five you get this one. I said four and a half. It's six and a half. Hmm
*  That's high I think they play two other next three weeks is that possible
*  Yeah, so if you look at Seattle right now
*  Which I know they played already sorry, yeah good Seattle season isn't over
*  But it's not looking great. They're four and five and they have at San Francisco home, Arizona
*  And they have a great season
*  But it's not looking great they're four and five and they have at San Francisco home, Arizona at Jets at Arizona
*  and
*  They have to go at least three and one in those four. I think to even sniff the playoffs. I agree
*  Four no ideally, but I don't know the is Metcalfe gonna play like that. Yeah, it seems so important to them like AJ Brownish
*  The
*  Fairly watchables Packers at the Bears the Bears are not watchable. I can attest to that today
*  I'm gonna say Packers by three and a half of this
*  Yeah, I said that too and we're way off. Let's say six and a half. Oh
*  I guess that makes sense because the Bears look awful. Everyone's out on them
*  Why can't Fandl be out on the Jets like they are the Bears?
*  I'll say this if they fire their coach, I'll be betting the Bears neck in Oh
*  Interesting. Yeah, does he have to clog the toilet or you'll do it like the clogger shit unseen. Yeah, I
*  Love the clogger
*  Lions are home for the Jaguars and
*  You can't quite go to 10 for this I'm gonna say nine and a half. Oh you can I said eleven and a half
*  It's twelve and a half. Oh
*  I mean, they're just gonna kill some teams, right? Yeah, but that's
*  I love that three team to use it off like an emotional win. We're doing it three
*  So we could three team tease that still at 12 and a half. Yeah, you could you could get wait
*  Can we take the chiefs to 11 and a half? Yeah, you can I'm doing that one
*  And then the Jets to plus six now now no, no, no touch. No last one is Dolphins Raiders
*  In Miami
*  And I said dolphins by six and a half you got exactly good job I said five six and a half it is
*  Poop factor Vikings at Tennessee. I have Vikings by three and a half. No, you went low here
*  I said five and a half. It's six and a half
*  I'm putting that game on a upset watch
*  They're not screwing around with these lines they're like we're not you know, even though I know the underdogs
*  You know fired away today
*  They're making the Vikings easily easily easily could have lost that can't today the Jaguars. I know but look at the numbers
*  I know I know it was sitting there as a loss and the Jaguars are just too stupid
*  Saints are home for the Browns
*  new coach theory
*  hmm still in existence for the second week I
*  Got the Saints by one and a half
*  You get this I had I don't know. Why am I doing the Pickums? That's so stupid. It's two and a half. Okay
*  Sunday night chargers Bengals
*  Kind of a must-win for the Bengals I'm gonna say chargers by one and a half
*  Oh, no, are you making a comeback here? I said one one half it is
*  That's in oh, I I can't I don't think this would be a huge Cincinnati crack nine to five
*  Can we go to that? We should go to that and do the podcast right afterwards in the park Sunday night
*  Monday night Texans Cowboys battle for Texas
*  putting it in the in the man cusp of the Vegas zone Texans
*  Minus five and a half at Dallas. Oh
*  No, I said seven. It's six and a half
*  And I get it that's a way you won the week. All right, six four one overall. I love it in weeks
*  Yeah that I
*  Had the league must be so pissed. They have to show the Cowboys in prime time
*  What a disaster
