# Is Tom Brady a Bad Announcer? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [November 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE)
*  I thought Brady was just bad today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  That Lions Packers, which I thought was a really good game. And I found myself, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=4.08s)]
*  I just really wanted better announcers for it. He just doesn't tell me enough. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=10.88s)]
*  And, you know, he was talking about the weather and sometimes it's hard to catch a pass, but [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=16.48s)]
*  I just felt like what was going on with love, like Brady's obviously played hurt. I really wanted, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  that would have been the perfect, Romo would have dove into that and be like, I can tell love's hurt [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=26.56s)]
*  and here's why. Watch this throw, watch this plant leg. Like just teach me something. Brady's not [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=30.88s)]
*  teaching us anything. I feel like he's getting advised in the wrong way. I think he's over, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=35.6s)]
*  over preparing for these and in those, you know, Friday they interview each coach and everything. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=41.44s)]
*  And I think he's overemphasizing what's going on there where he should just sit back and do [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=46.8s)]
*  what you're saying. That's what we want to hear. You're the quarterback, you're the general of the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=50.96s)]
*  field, you know. He should do a blind game and not even know who's on either team and just [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=55.04s)]
*  fucking watch the game and tell us what he sees. See, I don't think he's doing that at all. See, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=59.68s)]
*  now it's going to be sports blog posts, Simmons and Sal eviscerate Tom Brady. I'm not like, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=63.92s)]
*  I think he's being poorly produced is where I'm landed because I think whatever they're telling [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=69.12s)]
*  him to do, it's not working. I don't feel like I'm watching the game with him. He comes in the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=74.0s)]
*  beginning. He's got this like fake energy where he's going, I'm so excited for this one, Kevin. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=78.32s)]
*  It's just like, none of it feels genuine to me. And then on top of it, he owns a piece of the Vegas [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=84.0s)]
*  and it feels like he can't be as critical maybe as he wants to be in certain spots. But [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=90.16s)]
*  I thought that game today, I wanted him to dive into golf. Like what, what did you see with golf? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=95.12s)]
*  You went against him in a super bowl. How has he evolved over the last six years? There's this guy's [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=100.48s)]
*  like one of the greatest resources in football that we have and they don't tap into any of it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=105.28s)]
*  And he's been, it's not even that he's so accomplished as a player. We've heard him [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=109.52s)]
*  in interviews. We know he could do exactly what you want him to do there. Right. We know he can [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=114.64s)]
*  analyze from that perspective. So that's why, that's why it falls short. But well, and also [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=118.72s)]
*  we're watching all these other games and he's getting dusted by other announcers. Yeah, that's [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=123.52s)]
*  true. And they're just like you, like Romo doing the other game today, like he's just what he was [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=128.32s)]
*  doing the Baltimore game. He's just way better. Greg Olson gives us a better quarterback's [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=134.24s)]
*  perspective than, than Brady does the tight end, you know? Yeah, I know it's in there and I just, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=139.36s)]
*  they have not unlocked it. And I think they really have to figure it out. And he, he seems super [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=145.84s)]
*  over-prepared to me. And this could be, is it a one and done? You think he could be out? I don't [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=151.68s)]
*  think he's good at it. Yeah. And then now we've had nine weeks and I feel like he's gotten worse [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=158.16000000000003s)]
*  than he was four or five weeks ago. Now he's gotten like too many notes, but it's, it's when [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=163.36s)]
*  we get to the playoffs and this is like, there's only one game on, it's going to be pretty glaring [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  when we're watching all these other playoff games and these guys are doing, you know, he's competing [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  against people that are watching games that instantly can be like, Oh, watch this, watch this [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=178.24s)]
*  over here. And when he has a good point, he's so excited to tell you the point because he's like, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=182.32000000000002s)]
*  Oh, I know this is good. And it's almost like he's, none of it feels natural to me. It's like hitting [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=187.36s)]
*  a buzzer is a game playing a game show. I got one about that same laporta pass. It's just, it's just [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=192.16s)]
*  everything about it feels off and, and not genuine to me. Yeah. I mean, we had the first couple of [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=199.04s)]
*  weeks where he didn't say a word. He wasn't filling the dead space and that was rough. And then I think [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=204.48s)]
*  he had two or three where he was getting the hang of it and you got excited. And now you're right. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=208.4s)]
*  Now he's like just super, super hyper tense about every play. It's weird. It's been, it's been great [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=212.0s)]
*  for Akeman. It's been great for Collins worth. It's been great for Roma cause he's not even remotely [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=218.8s)]
*  on the level of those dudes. Are you done eviscerating? Wait, what is this? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  Got to be more. Is that an evisceration or obliteration? Oh my God. It was, it was a, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=227.36s)]
*  how about this? Able, a blesseration, I think. How about this? Who are the people watching these [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=232.4s)]
*  games going, Brady was awesome. Yeah. Oh my God. I learned so much from Brady. Like he's just not [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=238.0s)]
*  doing a good enough job. I really think they need to hit the reset button, clear the cache, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=243.52s)]
*  start over and just be like, we overloaded you with too much stuff. Let's get back to the basics. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=250.4s)]
*  Just watch the game with Burkhart. Tell us what you see. Come into the game with like five, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=256.0s)]
*  six little things that you know you want to hit. Like Jared Goff, I played against him. Boom, boom, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=260.8s)]
*  boom. Jordan Love, he's hurt. I had a, I had a strain groin in 2013. Here's what I learned. I [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=265.68s)]
*  learned that I had to like get rid of the ball fat. Like that's the kind of shit we want. And [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=272.72s)]
*  they're not giving us any of it. You know what? I just had a good idea and I don't think they'll do [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=276.0s)]
*  this, but they should replace Brady and Fox should pay to Sean Watson $350 million. But then you hear [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=280.8s)]
*  the quarterback's perspective from a one that sucked, couldn't get out of his own way for the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=287.76000000000005s)]
*  last two and a half years or more. Just paying that money off. People go ape shit. I thought you were [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=291.92s)]
*  going another direction. As you know, I hate the three man booth, but I actually think he needs the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=298.96s)]
*  three man booth. I think he needs like a curious third person who can kind of set them up. I always [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=303.44s)]
*  felt like Kornheiser when he didn't run in football and it didn't work out, but the potential of it [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=309.12s)]
*  was a curious person in the booth. He was like asking Jaws questions, right? And Tariqo hated [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=313.91999999999996s)]
*  it, which is why it didn't work. You know what? Try, try one week with Gronk in there. They can [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=320.0s)]
*  make fun of each other. I would actually do Edelman. I think if you put Edelman in there, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=324.4s)]
*  he needs something to loosen himself up, but they're not going to do it because they don't [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=330.96s)]
*  want to admit defeat and he's hosting the Super Bowl and they're paying him this crazy number. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=335.35999999999996s)]
*  But it's just not good. That was a really cool game today that needed better announcers. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA8Nb05SxlE&t=340.23999999999995s)]
