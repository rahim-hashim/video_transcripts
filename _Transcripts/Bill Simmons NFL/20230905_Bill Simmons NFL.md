# Will the Falcons Surprise in the NFC South? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re6lg2C-CKA)
*  All right, the NFC South.
*  New Orleans is the favorite.
*  Plus 130. They're over under is nine and a half. 17-1 for the conference. Minus 188 for the playoffs.
*  I instinctively, in June and July and for most of August, was out on New Orleans.
*  Because I thought Derek Carlin kind of semi-shot last year and I was just, New Orleans is old, the cap, blah blah blah.
*  And then I was like, I'm gonna go Atlanta or Carolina and that's where I'm heading.
*  And then Carolina quickly became appalled. We'll talk about them in a second.
*  Right.
*  And I just couldn't get there with Atlanta with Ritter because I watched all those games.
*  And I don't, I know Atlanta is like the sexy pick. The football nerds are in and whatever and look at this and they've been married so bad.
*  Is Ritter gonna be
*  better than Derek Carr? No. The worst version of Derek Carr, Ritter's not gonna be better than. What are the odds that Derek Carr just,
*  maybe he's just better this year. Maybe he needed to get out of Las Vegas. Maybe he wasn't vibing with McDaniels.
*  He's young enough that I could see him going to New Orleans. He's playing a ton of games indoors.
*  They have the easy schedule in the league. He's got good receivers. Camaro's come back for week four.
*  I talked myself into them. Their schedule is so easy. It's like staggering.
*  Yeah.
*  And that was it. I think they go 10 and 7. I think they hit the over.
*  I have it even better at 11 and 6. And if you, I think you and I approach it the same way. You look for the best quarterback coach combination.
*  And you're not gonna find it in the NFC South.
*  Right. Okay. So even taking the Saints, I'm gonna admit that, right? It's kind of a joke. He's 15 and 38.
*  But I still think Carr is capable. I think they surrounded him with some nice pieces. Honestly, if you're being honest,
*  I'm not talking about Bryce Young four years from now. If you want one quarterback on any team in the NFC South,
*  you would take Derek Carr, right? So they gave him the 60 million. You don't need Michael Thomas to be your main guy.
*  He could be the third option.
*  Well, that's the thing. If Olave becomes kind of semi-special, which I think he showed a lot of signs of last year.
*  That's the other thing for them.
*  Yeah. Jawan Johnson's nice, a tight end. That Shahid guy they like. Joe Woods is a defensive coordinator.
*  They signed our guy Jamal Williams.
*  Yeah. Jamal Williams. Goal line back. So I think they're gonna be pretty good. And they have really good
*  secondary with Latimore and Matthew. They're one of the few teams we just talked about that have a good defense.
*  So I'll go defense and quarterback. Not sure about the coach gets me to the Saints winning division.
*  Well, also they have a good offensive line. It's not top five, but it's probably like top eight.
*  Right. And Carr last year, you know, did not have a good offensive line. They only won good linemen.
*  Cold weather games early. I'm looking at that. Yeah. Only three prime time, you know, under the radar team.
*  I'm going to do good. I write down the hard games for each team that seem hard.
*  And for them, I only had at Green Bay, at New England, at Atlanta and at the Rams and at Tampa.
*  And the Rams and Tampa aren't even good. Yeah. So I, you just can't get there.
*  And any, you know, they played Detroit at home. They played Tennessee at home.
*  The schedule, they're playing all the bad teams in the league and I don't see how they won't go to the same.
*  This might be an adjusted. This could be an adjusted win thing for us. Right.
*  Well, I saw the 11 plus wins is plus 210, which I thought was pretty enticing. Yeah.
*  You know, the one seed is 17 to one. That seems a little outrageous, but they'd probably have to go 13 and four.
*  I'm not ready to do that. But Carr was good two years ago. I don't know what happened on last year.
*  He looked like a shot boxer. Right. And he was just he just looked like he didn't want to get hit.
*  He'll lose a game that he shouldn't. Yeah. But I'm on two in on Carr.
*  I have over 22 and a half touchdown passes. Yeah. I have a minus 165.
*  Fandl has by division. You could bet who's going to be the top passer by the division.
*  Carr to have the most passing yards in the NFC South. I like that.
*  Atlanta is next. This was the single hardest team for me.
*  And I changed my mind. I would say 130 times. The over under is eight and a half.
*  You want to think about a little more? I might. Plus 210 for the division.
*  Last year, there are seven and ten. They took Bijon Robinson with the eighth pick, which was just bizarre, but then also kind of awesome.
*  But it was the one it was the best spot on their team because they had Tyler RG or they had Cordell Patterson.
*  Seventeen hundred yards between those guys. So I wasn't looking at that team going, you know, what they need a running back, but he's going to be really fun to watch.
*  Defense. They took Bates from Cincinnati. They added all these starters, whatever. House is excited about it.
*  I can't get there with Ritter. And if I'm wrong, I'm wrong. But from what I saw and I bet on two of the games and I just I just didn't see it.
*  I don't know what he's good at. Yeah. So I can't get there. So I have them. I actually have them slightly over at nine and eight because the schedule is really after that.
*  All that I had five hard games at Detroit, at Jacksonville, at Tennessee, at Chicago and at New Orleans.
*  That's it for hard games and at Chicago might not even be a hard game, but their home games are ludicrous. Green Bay is their hardest home game.
*  You know, they have zero rest advantage. They don't have a rest advantage in any game. Well, because that kind of matters.
*  You know what? You know why? Because they play every Sunday. Yeah. They're just Sunday in the afternoon. Every game they have one o'clock.
*  They have one London game in week four. But other than that, it's just one o'clock or four o'clock every week for the rest of the season.
*  And the Bears and Jets on the road in December is not not ideal, I think. Yeah. This is the one that jumped out at me.
*  When these come out in April. Yeah. I saw Atlanta eight and a half. I was like, oh my God. How? Why? Why? Yeah, that's like I know they were they were gamers last year for a while.
*  But yeah, I'm with you. I don't think Robinson. I think you drafted running back that early if you're one piece away from making it to the Super Bowl.
*  And they're not. And like we said, that Patterson and Algier were good. I think they screwed up. They had a lot of cap space.
*  They could have gone after Lamar Jackson. And I think they're going to regret not doing so.
*  This is the most hyped non-playoff team in the NFC. Yeah. Maybe next to the Lions.
*  I don't feel 100 percent on it. I'll say that. Like I like if they went 10 and 7 and Ritter turned out to be a little better than we saw last year.
*  I'm not going to be shocked. Right. Yeah. Well, the South Division suck. I just think New Orleans is a safer bet.
*  But I don't feel good about any of this. I certainly wouldn't bet on it. I will bet on the next thing, though.
*  I think Carolina's going to suck. And once we decided we were doing this Sunday show for FanDuel TV,
*  then I'm super excited about this live pregame gambling show with you and Raheem and House and JJ.
*  We all ended up on this text thread. Right. And I was in Boston with my daughter and I was listening to their podcast.
*  It was like a parent corner, but you're Joe House's parent. It's a Joe House parent corner.
*  And House was saying he mentioned a couple of times that Frank Reck was a good coach and now that Frank Reck is there.
*  And we just it turned into this four hour text fight because there is zero evidence that Frank Reck is a good coach.
*  Zero. And including and then House, who does a podcast this week, and that was like, you know, who could have the worst record in the league?
*  Carolina and just basically peas all over my Carolina stuff.
*  Frank Reck, oh, four and one and opening, opening weeks and classic like, what did he say?
*  I forgot how to bet takes dealer Joe House. Yeah, but he went from Frank Reck was the best coach in there.
*  Anyway, I'm mad at House House and I're in a fight and it deprive him of spare.
*  So just go under. But Frank Reck is a bad coach. There's no evidence that he's a good coach.
*  He was bad in Indianapolis. They had a different quarterback every year that he brought.
*  The team was underprepared. He was so bad that his his owner fired him and hired a guy from TV thinking they'd be better off.
*  And then he goes to Carolina like quarterback whisperer Frank Reck is quarterback whisperer.
*  This Nick Foles thing, Nick Foles winning the Super Bowl because the Patriots had Matt Patricia, who's one of the worst coaches of all time in any sport.
*  And Nick Foles looks good. And then it becomes Frank Reck quarterback whisperer.
*  All he did was run quarterbacks into the ground in Indianapolis over and over again.
*  Phil Rivers did the best and he ended up retiring. Carson Wentz, Matt Ryan, Jacoby Percett pick a quarterback. They all look terrible.
*  They have their offensive line was just getting annihilated in the in the preseason.
*  I feel bad for Bryce Young because I like Bryce Young and I like this Carolina team last year. I think they're going to stink.
*  Wow. So three or four wins. Put them in the bottom there. I have them at four and thirteen.
*  Interesting. I had them at seven, but you might have convinced me now to put it at zero.
*  I don't know. And as bad as right has been and you brought that up, but this GM Tepper, this GM is on the hot seat.
*  Just five seasons, five quarterbacks plus hired Matt Rule. So it's got to work out eventually for this.
*  But how could it? New head coach, new OC, new DC, new quarterback isn't usually a good formula.
*  Remember they were 21 of 21 nothing against Tampa and they kind of stumbled into a recipe.
*  We were betting on them a bunch of times second half of the year. They were this power run game, not asking Darnell to do too much.
*  Their defense is actually pretty good. Like they had six chippers on the team. Brown, Burns, Thompson, Lubeau, Horn and Chin.
*  Like they their defense is going to keep them in games, which is why maybe they get a little higher.
*  I just think they're going to have the worst offense in the league. They have the worst skill position guys.
*  They had Thielen, Sanders. Thielen's done. Those guys are done. They have no run game.
*  And Bryce Young, rookie QB just running for his life.
*  And they got the defense of like J.C. Horn and Dante Jackson both missed 10 games in the last two years.
*  But it's interesting. They blow that Tampa game and they should have won. Wilkes gets fired.
*  Tampa limps into the playoffs. Your team destroys them and then radio retires.
*  But like they should have beaten Tampa and then Wilkes probably stays. I don't know what they do with the Bryce Young pick.
*  Maybe they trade it.
*  Well should our overall, before we even get to Tampa, advice for people betting the NFC South B2 just sit back for a little bit.
*  I feel like we changed our minds three times.
*  Don't do it.
*  And the best quarterback in football barely won it.
*  I do like New Orleans though.
*  Yeah.
*  So are you in New Orleans?
*  Yeah, New Orleans is the one with the division.
*  Even odds.
*  But I just, it's an infuriating division. It really is.
*  Yeah, this is definitely like don't throw anyone from this division in a tease because God only knows.
*  No.
*  Tampa they're over under 6 1 2. I get slight under. I have them like 5 and 12, 6 and 11.
*  I have them 6. Yeah, there's not a ton to like about them.
*  Worst quarterback situation in the league, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Kyle Trass, Baker Mayfield.
*  And Baker. Yeah.
*  It's his fourth team.
*  I can't say I'm a huge Todd Bowles fan.
*  He's definitely right up there. First coach fired. Fourth team since last June for Baker.
*  That's almost impossible.
*  And I just don't know what kind of identity. I told you like Brady threw like 733 passes last year.
*  Yeah.
*  And they had 1300 rushing yards. So I don't know. This could be it for Bowles.
*  Still big names, which is weird, right? It's Evans. It's Godwin. People get excited for that.
*  Devon White, Shaq Barrett, Levante David.
*  Worst.
*  Yeah. And I don't think it adds up. I really don't. I have them 6 1 2.
*  Yeah. I'm wondering if it goes the other way where maybe they become a seller around week 5, week 6.
*  Yeah.
*  And try to get into the...
*  They did what the Rams did, right? They mortgaged the future for a Super Bowl and they got it.
*  Their schedule, they week 11 to 15, they're at San Francisco, at Indianapolis, at Atlanta, at Green Bay.
*  So they actually have six road games out of eight going from week 8 to week 15, starting with at Buffalo on a Thursday in week 8.
*  I just think they're going to be...
*  Yeah, that's what's killer because they play a first place schedule and they're projected to come in fourth.
*  Their extra games are Philly, at San Francisco, and at Buffalo. Doesn't get worse than that.
*  So before we leave the NFC South, what's the highest possible record Atlanta would get and the lowest possible record?
*  Because I really am intrigued by them.
*  If Ritter could just out of nowhere be like what Kenny Pickett was doing in the last four games last year.
*  Because they are talented and they can block and they do have weapons and I like their coach.
*  I'm so against them. I have the minus 120 to not make the playoffs.
*  Yeah, I'm with you. Could you see them going 6 and 11?
*  Yeah, that's what I have.
*  Could you see them going 11 and 6?
*  I don't know. But this division, like I said, don't be surprised and try not to watch it unless they play your favorite team.
*  Something worries me about them.
