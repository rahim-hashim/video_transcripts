# Drake Maye is a “Sure Thing”  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [December 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs)
*  The announcers were praised in the past today because they they rolled Drake may out a couple times [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, they played with pace. They did a fake punt. They were like the Patriots aggressive. I'm like we're three and [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=5.96s)]
*  Eleven like of course [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=13.0s)]
*  What are we what are we protecting we suck? Yeah, I was sending you live odds for them [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=14.76s)]
*  They were plus 142 when they're up by 10. What was it for never never ever never ever did [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=20.76s)]
*  I think we were winning that game? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=27.2s)]
*  Hmm cuz if I had been panicking about the draft pick [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=28.54s)]
*  There would have been a moment in that game where I was like, holy shit [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=32.78s)]
*  We're gonna blow this and actually win but it was the perfect game Drake may know he knows the program do just enough [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=35.54s)]
*  Get everyone excited. He's gonna have a couple dumb 21 year old plays [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=41.94s)]
*  He has every game because he's 21 years old but I love them. Let me ask you something [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=45.94s)]
*  I'll be honest. I'm not don't I do know but what is the difference between him and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=51.980000000000004s)]
*  Mac Jones the first oh my god Mac Jones. Oh my god after 10 weeks [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=57.74s)]
*  He was saying they should redraft Mac Jones would be one. Oh stop. Well, what's the did? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=63.88s)]
*  Actually, it was always like a game manager this guy. Oh my god [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=69.42s)]
*  So the bundle sent me something and if I'll offensive success rate leader since week 10 [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=72.64s)]
*  Lions Packers Ravens Bengals Bills Rams Patriots [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=79.74000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Drake Bay is good we have nobody we have no receivers we can't block we have a running back that has seven fumbles this year [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=84.12s)]
*  You never say there's been a seven fumble player since 2020. Yeah, I'm sorry, but you love Mac Jones [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=91.36s)]
*  I'm just saying be careful. You love you did love Mac Jones took you to go further [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=98.28s)]
*  Yeah, my favorite Boston rookie of the 21st century [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=102.92s)]
*  What? Yeah [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  Yes, really yeah, I'm all in I'm all in I'm happy to be haunted with this clip forever Drake Bay is a sure thing [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=108.48s)]
*  All the past is about it now. We've been watching what he's fucking incredible team sucks [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=116.56s)]
*  Wait a minute wasn't Mookie Betts a rookie for you. Yeah, I love Mookie Betts. I have them above Mookie Betts [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=122.08s)]
*  And I love Mookie Betts. Oh [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  Man, it's so hard to get a quarterback. It's like the fucking single hardest thing to do [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  You could go no [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=135.24s)]
*  Decades without one. I really thought after Brady we'd have no chance to ever have one again [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=136.76000000000002s)]
*  And now we have this fucking guy fell out of the sky [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=141.60000000000002s)]
*  It's amazing and and the funniest thing is he might not even be the best quarterback in his class because Daniels is also amazing [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=143.84s)]
*  Mm-hmm, but like if you gave Caleb versus Drake made it's like no contest. I can't believe you [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=150.56s)]
*  This is a little much. This is just a tiny bit much [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=156.12s)]
*  I don't feel like it is based on the Mac Jones [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  You did love you never you didn't call him a game manager for after ten weeks you'd love them [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=161.52s)]
*  You thought he was number one or two in the league rookie if if Harrison started to be like a lifeguard at the beach [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=166.08s)]
*  Oh, this is personal now. Yeah [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=172.78s)]
*  My Harrison or James. Yeah, and he just swim out and save somebody's life [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=175.56s)]
*  Still unlike him [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=182.56s)]
*  He'd be like, wow, that was nice. He did it every week. You'd be like this kids a hell of a lifeguard [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=184.0s)]
*  What kind of life is he? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=188.8s)]
*  Week after week is just like [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=190.8s)]
*  He's fucking I can't believe the shit he's doing. Oh my god [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=192.8s)]
*  The first drive today he did five six things that were like I can't believe he didn't get sacked [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=196.08s)]
*  I can't believe he got out of that. I can't believe he threaded the new needle to booty. He was covered by two guys [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=201.84s)]
*  How did he get on the ball? Like he's like incredible [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=206.96s)]
*  But you could believe that he didn't win right because he's done that 12 times [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=209.6s)]
*  Well, not that bad you could believe now I'm super excited about Drake man, you're not gonna pour water on it [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=215.12s)]
*  All right [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=220.20000000000002s)]
*  Okay, and I like it for Harrison if he was a great lifeguard and just saving lives everywhere [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=220.56s)]
*  I think both of those are overrun over exaggerating three and twelve. Have you been watching him? I have he's like shockingly good [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=224.68s)]
*  What the fuck what really? Yeah, I don't know. All right [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=233.56s)]
*  I gotta look give give somebody who's super talented [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=236.9s)]
*  The worst coaching the worst play calling the worst blocking and the worst receivers and then they're still gonna get 28 first downs [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=240.1s)]
*  On the road against Buffalo. I'm just saying be careful because we've [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteegfYfdFs&t=247.02s)]
