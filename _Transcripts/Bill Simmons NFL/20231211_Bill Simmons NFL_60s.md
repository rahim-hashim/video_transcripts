# Mahomes Throws a Tantrum #billsimmons #podcast #shorts #nfl
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [December 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFOWECVCp-k)
*  the chiefs were incredibly upset after the game and during the game because [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFOWECVCp-k&t=0.0s)]
*  Mahomes threw a tantrum. And then after the game, Mahomes and Andy Reed, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFOWECVCp-k&t=3.86s)]
*  and they're like, that's ridiculous. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFOWECVCp-k&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  I thought it was kind of beneath them the way they wind about this. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFOWECVCp-k&t=9.84s)]
*  It was like, he was outside. Sorry, we have rules. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFOWECVCp-k&t=13.32s)]
*  I feel bad saying this and I'll take it back. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFOWECVCp-k&t=15.84s)]
*  If he comes up tomorrow as a press conferences as a, I lost my cool. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFOWECVCp-k&t=18.04s)]
*  We got to get focused for the remainder of the season. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFOWECVCp-k&t=21.88s)]
*  The Bills played great and all that stuff, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFOWECVCp-k&t=24.2s)]
*  but I lost a little respect for Patrick Mahomes and I love that guy. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFOWECVCp-k&t=25.88s)]
*  I talk about him as a generational quarterback like everybody else does, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFOWECVCp-k&t=29.08s)]
*  but crying during the post game handshake with Josh Allen, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFOWECVCp-k&t=32.64s)]
*  like that's one of the worst calls I've ever seen. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFOWECVCp-k&t=35.64s)]
*  And the other thing is Mahomes has benefited from a bunch of questionable calls [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFOWECVCp-k&t=37.64s)]
*  over the years. Maybe they're not a dynasty of the chiefs, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFOWECVCp-k&t=41.6s)]
*  but as far as a team that's close to being a dynasty, they were pretty likable. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFOWECVCp-k&t=43.96s)]
*  Everybody hates your team. Everybody hates my team. When they were dynasties, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFOWECVCp-k&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  the chiefs, I feel like avoid that between the Taylor Swift stuff. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFOWECVCp-k&t=50.92s)]
*  And now if he's going to become a cry baby, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFOWECVCp-k&t=55.4s)]
*  this puts him in different territory, I think. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFOWECVCp-k&t=57.64s)]
