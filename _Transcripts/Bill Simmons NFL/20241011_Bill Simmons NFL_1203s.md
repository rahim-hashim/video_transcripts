# Million-Dollar Picks Week 6 With Peter Schrager  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [October 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TwfYgRBzC4)
*  All right, we're gonna do million dollar picks for week six. We actually got kind of worked last week. We lost
*  595 thousand dollars and I still feel good about all the picks. I gotta be honest
*  Down 398 for the season. That's not why house is none this week. I'm in New York City
*  I was gonna say easier to do this all at once but uh, so we had the Packers
*  26 and a half over they somehow only scored 24 against the Rams, but they won we had the Steelers
*  All they have to do is just stop Dallas on the last drive of the game. Somehow Dallas goes 15
*  So I kind of like the picks but by the way, I want to give you credit you and Sal
*  That was amazing that you guys stayed up to the last night. Oh my god
*  I had to get up early next day to take the Accela. I was like, how am I doing this?
*  heroic. I'm old
*  So million dollar picks I actually kind of like this week. I want to go through some of the games and
*  I'll give you veto power if something horrifies you
*  The first one is the Bears in London and I this would violate a don't bet on the one again
*  We did win the manifesto. We won the Vikes last week though
*  Okay against the Jets had to sweat it out, but the Bears are only one and a half in London against the Jags favorites
*  So give you a little wrinkle here. Well the things that worried me about the Jags
*  They might have found something with Bigsby. Oh tank is good and
*  It and ETN's hurt and I don't know if he's playing or not
*  But Bigsby's like I know he's a big Kyle Brand angry runs guy, but I
*  So the fear of going against them is that he's giving them an identity
*  Lawrence's three and one in London. I'm willing to just punt on this but what do you think about this game little stuff that may
*  Play into a point spread change or whatever the Bears got out there yesterday. They're settled. They're ready to go
*  They're gonna play they've got all their fans there peanut Tillman's they're doing a fan rally the whole thing
*  Jaguars were supposed to fly out today
*  Flight delayed several hours because of the hurricane all sorts of travel issues and they've got to be there for two straight weeks
*  So I don't know how that plays into it
*  But all they do is talk about body rhythm and everything needs to be set hour to hour on these London trips
*  And it's been you know sleep science experts and they had a nice little curveball to start their two-week saunder to London
*  So I don't know if that helps Jaguars at all
*  Well, the question for me is the Jags have the Pats next week
*  Could the Jags be three and four leaving London and we're all back in on the drugs
*  It's possible could the Jags be one and six leaving London
*  And it's like and guess who's not getting on the plane with the Jags, Doug Peterson. I just don't know what to expect
*  Here's the thing with the Bears defense has been like shockingly good. They've got good players on defense
*  There's have you heard about this thing called havoc rate? No, what it's havoc rate. I shouldn't laugh at it
*  I know it's probably being used by the teams and I know it's good
*  So as you know, whose thing is it as you know, there's some way I'm not a wind probability guy
*  There's some stupid ones. This is Warren sharp had this actually shut out to Warren
*  Did he create it or he takes it? I just saw it on his Twitter feed but rate of plays for sacks
*  forced fumbles
*  Interceptions
*  Tfls and PBU so it's opportunistic
*  capitalize on the opportunity. Yeah
*  good defensive things
*  Additive defensive okay our top five is the Giants. All right the Browns which shocked me. Okay Vikings
*  49ers bears, okay number five and that kind of backs up what I'm watching with the eye test
*  Like they're better in the second half than the first half
*  I think they're like plus 31 in the second half and it feels like they're getting a little bit better each week
*  I don't know if that's competition or not, but
*  I one of the things I love about this for them is the Jags defense
*  Thirty second against the pass. Yeah, I mean they just 31st yards per play 24 straight 30 first turnovers
*  They're 30th on third down. It's like another nice Caleb spot
*  So I wonder if this is like one more awesome Caleb week followed by
*  This NFC North schedule coming. Yeah. Yeah, so you like bears minus let's do it
*  Jaguars are historically good in London with Trevor Lawrence though. That's the only thing but I don't know man
*  Be fun to root for let's go bears so there's one other one that I kind of like for this the Jaguars first half
*  Chicago for the game is plus 750. Oh
*  Wow, so Jaguars are leading the little Jags and then the Bears come back
*  I'm not gonna do it, but I that jumped out to me alright next one lions minus three in Dallas
*  Okay, lions have been I think the lion in Dallas since 2011 seven straight right how boys when the Lions are a little bit public
*  No Lawrence, you know Parsons, maybe if he
*  Even if they have on these
*  Dallas this is a weird one Dallas is second passing
*  31st running
*  Detroit's 27th against the pass
*  fourth against the run hmm, so you could say
*  That's good for Dallas or that's terrible for Dallas
*  That's terrible for Dallas. I just think they're gonna throw the whole time that guy Jalen Tolbert got picked up in every
*  By the way that touchdown catch you made was a great catch fourth down
*  Detroit six running Dallas's defenses 24th against the run here. Here's where I've landed on this one
*  So Dallas gave up 72 to New Orleans and Baltimore
*  Nuts, and then they gave up 49 in Cleveland New Orleans or Cleveland
*  Pittsburgh and the Giants
*  Yeah, those are bad offenses. I think if you have a good offense you could move the ball up and down all day on Dallas
*  Yeah, it's Mike Zimmer after like four weeks. We're like what the hell is this and then they put the clamps on the Giants
*  I guess in their buildings. I like the fact they did it in the road, but you're right
*  There's so many injuries you're banking on guys that we're not familiar with and I don't know how it's like
*  I don't know who have these dudes are so they go against the Steelers who Najee Harrison. That's it
*  They have the fourth four string guys getting reps for them fryer mickens and that's it fryer muth over the middle
*  That's it. There's a two hour lightning delay or about it's a fluky game
*  And I think I think this line should be higher
*  I think the Lions played an awesome game the last time we saw them
*  Yeah, and it's like this is what they expected to be their offense was pouring it on and they got the by they got healthy
*  I like the Lions they can
*  Probably top three or four offensive line no doubt top three or four weapons
*  It's indoors. I
*  Really like the Lions. I just think this line should be like lions by four and a half
*  The only thing that scares me is it's too obvious. Maybe Dak keeps the cowboys around sure
*  Maybe he's just flinging the ball. He was great on Sunday night was when it mattered
*  He did have turnovers in the fumble and the whole thing. Yeah, good point
*  Washington is plus six and a half is this the game of the week or do you go Dallas Detroit?
*  What game are you more excited for Baltimore?
*  Washington I'm more excited for Washington Ravens because I think it could be and it's funny the over is over 50
*  Which is a red flag that means everyone's assuming it's gonna be 37 34 and it probably won't be I had an interesting
*  Conversation with Scott van Pelt of ESPN because he's like this DC man
*  I said is this a rivalry game or not? I'd love to hear houses thoughts like yeah
*  No, it's it's not at all. It's a should be a rivalry
*  Franchises avoid played seven times. Yeah, they've never really been good at the same time
*  And like Colts fans from the Baltimore years of the Colts like maybe had issues with the Reds that's from the 80s and 70s
*  So like this is this whole battle the beltway. Yeah, sure, but it's not like this like rich rivalry between the two franchises, right?
*  Well Baltimore's defense gave up 90 against my homes Dak and burrow. I know
*  But then you could say well, they only give up 10 to Josh Allen
*  That was a weird game and I'm not sure that the bills are meant to play from behind like that with the receivers
*  They have that again. That's the best I've seen any team play on so yeah, they just blew them out
*  Do they bring that version or are they the version that Joe burrow and Jamar chase are going for 200?
*  Ravens defense
*  Wofl 31st against the pass they've given up 25.2 points a game
*  bottom eight in the red zone
*  Good against the run, I'm not sure that matters with Washington
*  So the question for me is could watch to win the game. I think they could yes
*  If Washington's down double figures in the second half could they get a garbage touchdown? Yes
*  I don't know why this line six and a half is it six and a half
*  I think it's just the experience and the lack of competition against Washington
*  No one's seen the commander's haven't played a powerhouse team yet
*  So the flip side is it's like the KC New Orleans game on Monday night. We're like, that's too many points
*  We're like that's too many points. I'm taking New Orleans and then Casey's like we're just gonna
*  Yes, Casey the shit out of this game because Lamar is playing amazing right? Yeah, so could they be up 10?
*  They have the ball and they have an eight-minute drive to close the game sure
*  But I think Washington could win the game and I think it's too many. I think it's gonna be a fun game
*  I think it's gonna be close. It's like a three-point game. I think it's gonna be close
*  Next one is Chargers Broncos. This is in Denver
*  We should mention you love you love champagne
*  I said it before the season on this podcast. I said, I don't know how I don't know where it's coming from
*  They're a playoff team. I got mocked after they were owing to
*  They look horrible against the Jets on offense
*  So and I didn't realize that Vance Joseph's defense was gonna be like the 76 Steelers
*  They're the best defense in football right now and Sir Tan and this Riley Moss might be the best
*  Cornerback duo they're unbelievable
*  And however, they make it work. They figure it out Denver. They're legit
*  opponents third
*  Yards-per-play, that's how good Denver's been. Yeah
*  Their offense scored 15 points against Pittsburgh and the Jets combined
*  But it's game. I mean any rookie quarterback getting better Harbaugh off a bye
*  Okay, Chargers team that in week four just had a shitload of injuries. Yeah missing both tackles
*  James was suspended Herbert was hurt. It had a shot. I was at that game too
*  Fourth fourth quarter they go for it on the fourth down which it was 10-10
*  They didn't need to and then the Chief snuck one out of there
*  So the Chargers are favored by two and a half in this game and the instinct would be like Denver's whoa
*  I gotta take the home dog. I
*  Really like the Chargers. Do you I do here's why?
*  Herbert best player in the field
*  It's gonna be ugly 10 to 10 10 7 13 10
*  But I'm willing to be talked out of it
*  Yeah
*  I just think that defense is is outstanding right now and Nick's is getting better every week and I feel like there's a good vibe
*  And good juice with the Broncos and they're playing at home
*  Right. Yeah, so you would stay away. I would stay away. But what do I know?
*  Never my analysis. No, but you know, it's interesting
*  The defense is so and like lad
*  McConkey had one of the great touchdown catches of the year against the Chiefs in the back of the end
*  They totally forgot to go to him and it's like I don't know if they're utilizing her word even in a way that's beneficial because
*  He hasn't had this step thought with hardball. I was gonna be Palmer was hurt
*  Palmer's back sure
*  Yeah, no, no, I'm waiting to see this Greg Roman hardball offense that everyone's marveling about down down on them down on that down
*  Down on the Chargers. Can I give you the LA defensive stats? Yes, they've allowed 50 points total this season
*  They're very good Vegas Carolina Pittsburgh and Casey. So why is Denver gonna move the ball on them at all? They might not
*  They might not I think the defense is very opportunistic and they'll do what they've done all season. I
*  Like it at minus two and a half. I don't like it at minus three
*  And I think this Denver team if we're just gonna go backwards
*  The Jets game was absolutely stupid
*  The weather was awful and they played like shit and if the Jets just make a field goal, they lose and last week
*  They're down ten nothing to the Raiders early and it's her tan gets the pin and then she
*  Throws just a horrible pat running to his left just wings it loses his job
*  So now I have to be excited about Denver. Maybe maybe this is the week they come back to the yeah
*  I might do it. I might not listen to you Sean Payton. I trust I know you chance Joseph. I trust I have the Broncos over
*  I'm also in on champagne, but they were there over
*  Great love those old-school unis
*  It was funny when everyone misidentified the 70s Broncos thing as a John Elway, it's like come on
*  I know I'm old but come on guys. You're right. It was a 70 17. They were on everyone's like
*  Let's do better
*  Just quickly Colts Titans Colts
*  Favored still one and a half in Tennessee stay away. It's a stay away and I think the South I have no idea
*  How about both South sir stay away? So stay away all of them. I don't this line. It didn't add up to me
*  What's the Saints? What's a rattler? What do we got with that one? Well, that's coming but pitman's out. Yeah
*  Flacco they came back and they do what they do they come all the way back
*  But they you know, they they won that game and then they you know, they they didn't
*  That didn't make sense. Here's what we're almost gonna win that game, but they couldn't put it away
*  You're not gonna believe I like this one, but me here Giants plus three and a half
*  against since he singles yeah
*  The Giants start out they lose 28 6 to Minnesota
*  They lose by three to Washington a game that they probably went with a field goal kicker and he looked back and like pretty good game
*  Graham Gano gets hurt on a kickoff
*  They beat the Browns 21 15, but it was really 28 to 15 single Terry was going over a touchdown and fell down
*  So that was a blowout. How's the neighbors game? He went nuts. They lose to Dallas
*  2015 on a Thursday night in a game
*  They usually could have won neighbors gets can cost right out and they played fucking awesome
*  So good against the Seahawks so good and now they're playing the Cincy team that remember the havoc rate from before tell me what?
*  32nd they suck at havoc
*  Terrible havoc great terrible at havoc and then you know Giants defense
*  Yeah
*  The tibetot stuff is concerning neighbors are not sure what he's gonna like those are but Dexter Lawrence is playing as good as any defensive
*  Top half of the league Shane Bowen third down first down passing arts
*  He's not getting buzz yet as a head coach Shane Bowen the defense for the Giants has been outstanding this year
*  the Bengals defense
*  Literally to everything is confounding. It's a lot of the same guys Lou Anna Ramos a great defensive code
*  Like it doesn't make sense and they cannot stop how about they have nothing they have no players
*  So 30th rushing 30th against rush
*  like the Giants I
*  Don't know
*  Tyrone Tracy
*  This line feels a point too high to me, and I like the Giants
*  It's funny. It's like we freak out. They lost 28 six at home
*  They got booed in their home opener, so it turned out Minnesota
*  We had them number three in our last Minnesota's five and oh and like a very good team and Van Ginkgels doing pick sixes against the Jets
*  Also, and if the Giants come out of this thing and they're three wins and four losses. It's all right. They're good team for fun and
*  Dimes look good the last two weeks back pretty consistent times is back. I'm buying time
*  I'm happy for dimes. I have one more that I like but we're staying away from Steelers Raiders Texans Pats
*  The NFC South the two Falcons Panthers bucks ain't some out. Yeah, did you see car to rattler swung the line by six points?
*  Yeah, seemed aggressive. It seemed like a lot. Are we sure he's car is worth six points to a spread. No doubt
*  Yeah, I was surprised also minus three and a half in New Orleans
*  That's a fucking stay away the Bucs have been there since I get a day bucks flew out because of the hurricane like right
*  You know I talked my friend who works with bucks. I'm like is your house all right in Tampa
*  He's like I think so he's like I'm currently at Dave and Buster's for the third straight day with my kids in New Orleans
*  Like that's like a full camping trip. They're on
*  Eagles minus eight and a half for now. It's up to nine and a half against Cleveland
*  I'm staying away. We should not be favored by that many
*  They rally I don't know and Packers Cardinals. That's a fun game. It's in the Vegas zone. It's five and a half
*  Yeah, I don't I don't trust either team so then the last game we started the podcast with
*  Bill's Jets Jets plus two and a half. Are you around Monday come with me to that let's go to that. I'm long gone
*  The only thing that scares me about this is
*  Well really nothing new coach theory, but the Buffalo's defense they suck against the run and the Jets are last against
*  The Jets this is the week they get the run game downings coming in he's gonna make a statement
*  It's gonna be we're gonna show you that we still have a great running game and like I have these two running backs
*  We're gonna use them
*  So would you go plus two and a half or would you just do Jets money line plus 120? I'll do the latter
*  That's just gonna win okay? I
*  Might add again narrative guy. I really like them not my money plus two and a half though
*  I'm getting to a sure point
*  Last thing before we do million dollar picks just gonna throw this out
*  Yeah, they have a little 30% profit boost token for okay for a touchdown
*  anytime touchdown in a game
*  Terry McLaurin plus 170
*  What are your thoughts? I like it who would you who would you go for a touchdown if not him anyone in the league?
*  Yeah, Tucker Kraft Tucker Kraft against the Cardinals. Let's let's let's look at our loves guy
*  Let's look up our guy Tucker Kraft Jordan love went to him in every big moment last week only two to one
*  Terrible on action all right back to McLaurin all right McLaurin, so we'll throw a little on him plus 170
*  All right
*  Filling in for Joe house this week because we're in New York City our guy Peter Schrager
*  So much success over the years
*  Week six million dollar picks we are down 398 thousand dollars for the season we're about to change
*  Let's go we're putting two hundred thousand and the following
*  Bears minus one and a half in London against the Jags you're believing in Caleb Williams. Yeah, yeah
*  You like the Bears I'm also like Jags weird travel stuff. I don't okay
*  the c-words
*  Getting six and a half against Baltimore. We think this is a three-point game
*  They might win it out right and even if it goes badly cheap touchdown time no doubt
*  Washington plus six and a half
*  This is the only one you didn't like so we'll see if you were right or wrong Chargers minus two and a half in Denver
*  Here's my case. I just think Denver's offense will not be able to move the ball at all against the Chargers
*  Harbaugh Payton coaches cancel out and I got Bo Nicks against Justin Herbert, and I think the Chargers need the game fair
*  also
*  Broncos beat the Jets by one and they win last that stupid game last
*  Is amazing that gardener mint shoes just fun whipping it to the other team
*  Lions Cowboys lions my history in Dallas sorry Sal. I think this line is gonna be four and a half by game time
*  We're grabbing it now lions off a bye
*  And then we're taking both New York teams because it's the week of New York sport. This is that's also your week in New York
*  It's my week in New York the Mets the Yankees the Liberty the Liberty
*  The Knicks just great stuff happening
*  Giants plus three and a half against a sense of defense that is
*  Potentially historically bad which is shocking and then Jets will just take the points the plus two and a half Monday night
*  Against Buffalo how's it feel to have a perfect slate?
*  It feels incredible. Let's win two hundred thousand on all those and then last but not least
*  Little fan dual profit boost token 30%
*  Terry McLaurin
*  Plus 170 to score in that crazy Baltimore, Washington game that we feel like if you have a lot of points
*  We'll have fireworks. Yeah, it'll be fun. Yeah, not a rivalry game. Those are the million dollar picks for
*  week six
*  You
