# Davante Adams and More Fantasy Football Disappointments (2024 Edition) | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [November 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0)
*  All right. So biggest disappointments this year, and I'm going to rule out injury guys. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=0.0s)]
*  I don't think it's fair to be like, I'm so disappointed in Nico Collins that he got hurt. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=5.68s)]
*  These have to be like, Dak was disappointing before he got hurt. Right. It's disappointing if [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=9.36s)]
*  you like what I did in my league with Sal, I thought Nick Chubb was coming back sooner and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=16.48s)]
*  it was going to be healthier. So I'm like, I'm going to lock down this Nick Chubb, Jerome Ford [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=22.8s)]
*  combo. And it turns out, Hey, Nick Chubb lost every ligament in his knee. Maybe it was going [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=26.56s)]
*  to take a little longer for him. I can't get mad at him for that. But you start looking at like [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=30.4s)]
*  Breece Hall, who was the number one pick in the draft. Right. And maybe that wasn't his fault. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=35.6s)]
*  Maybe it's like how house's team took Alex Sarr with the number two pick in the NBA draft. Oh, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=41.12s)]
*  you are you going to find Alex Sarr now? Why are we fighting firing shots? I mean, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=46.96s)]
*  I'm not firing shots. It's like the draft wasn't that good. And it's like, we take Alex Sarr. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=50.56s)]
*  It was you had to pick somebody. The fantasy draft was good. And Breece Hall wasn't supposed [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=54.72s)]
*  to be just anybody. It was supposed to be a top five offense with this incredible offensive line. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=60.64s)]
*  And the 40 year old, you know, lightness and darkness drug experimenter was supposed to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=66.4s)]
*  lead them to the promised land. So it was Bijon. It was Breece Hall. Who's the third? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=72.48s)]
*  Breece. So I mean, McCaffrey and McCaffrey was supposed to be first. And he won her for the year. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=80.24s)]
*  But to your point, you know, I actually pat ourselves in the back. I think bring your [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=85.92s)]
*  fancy football, you know, our rankings. I think we were one of the only sites to really move [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=88.8s)]
*  McCaffrey down off the first pick. We moved him to 12th and then back to fifth. But we moved him [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  off first, which I would pat ourselves in the back. But then we moved Breece Hall to first, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=96.72s)]
*  which man, it was like one of the worst picks you could not one of the worst. But I would say, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  honestly, the most disappointing running back relative to where you take them. I'm putting [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=103.28s)]
*  McCaffrey to the side. If you had said, you know what, we have Derek Henry first and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=106.72s)]
*  Saquon Barkley second, people would have thought you were on drugs with Rogers. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=110.72s)]
*  We joke all the time. I'm curious. I'm curious what you think. We joke all the time that we [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=114.8s)]
*  make that we want to tattoo things on our body like that movie Memento where we forget at the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=119.6s)]
*  end of the season and then we get to July. And like we literally had a tattoo at the top of my [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=124.32s)]
*  notes for 2024. I had don't rank Breece Oliver, Kyron Williams. We did it anyway. And I feel like [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=127.92s)]
*  our rankings at the end of last season, if you had told us Derek Henry, go to Baltimore and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=132.32s)]
*  Saquon, go to Philly House, wouldn't you? You should have just ranked them one too. I'm like, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=135.52s)]
*  I don't even know how we talk ourselves out of this. Yes. Yes. I mean, that's right. Because both of [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=138.8s)]
*  those situations were incredible situations. They were all upside situations for both players. And [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=142.72s)]
*  let's, you know, again, give credit where credit's due the incredibly handsome Craig Horlbeck, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  Bill Simmons and I in August were together. Craig came on and gave us his top five. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=154.4s)]
*  Derek Henry was his number one under the radar fantasy selection. So you guys were on it. I mean, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  America should have been on it. All of the models should have been on it. Those two guys have been [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=165.68s)]
*  the best and look at the numbers. There they are. Well, maybe Derek Henry should just be treated [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=169.84s)]
*  like LeBron at this point where it's just like, just assume he's going to keep doing this until [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=174.88s)]
*  he gets hurt. You're better off betting on it happening versus it not happening. But if we're [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  talking real disappointments, we're talking about where you can get mad at somebody. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=182.88s)]
*  As we do in fantasy, even though it's all fake and it's not these guys' faults that we drafted them. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=189.44s)]
*  If you were all in on Anthony Richardson, which I think people really spent on him, right? And [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  they're like, I don't care if he's accurate. He's going to run the ball. He's Cam Newton. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=199.76000000000002s)]
*  And that's a disaster. Now you can audible at the quarterback position. You can audible if you're [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=205.12s)]
*  spending 28 to $40 on DJ Moore. So I think he has to be up there with you're talking about first team [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=212.0s)]
*  all NBA fantasy football disappointments. And then Travis Etienne is another one because [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=219.12s)]
*  he was somewhere in the seven to 11 range for running backs, maybe 12. I don't know, but he was [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=226.48s)]
*  like in that second tier. He killed me in one of my leagues. He hasn't been good any week and he's [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=232.0s)]
*  always got the red flag with them. You never know what's going on. He's on a team tank. Bigsby kind [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=238.48s)]
*  of took a lot of his plays and his minutes. And that one is just like a sunk cost, right? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=243.52s)]
*  I think Etienne quietly might be the answer here, which he's not nearly as famous as, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=249.84s)]
*  or as interesting frankly, as Anthony Richardson. But you're right. Like, you know what? If you have [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=253.44s)]
*  Richardson, it sucked. You're probably angriest at Anthony Richardson, but you can add Bo Nicks. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=257.6s)]
*  Etienne has, I actually think Etienne is the single most frustrating player, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=261.44s)]
*  fantasy maybe, entire season, because you probably took him in the second round. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=265.04s)]
*  You might've taken him either before or just probably right. Like if you, you know, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=268.08000000000004s)]
*  there has to be like, we need a value over replacement. We need like anger over replacement. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=271.44s)]
*  Like you look back at your draft recap. Yeah. Yeah. Cause you look back at the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=275.91999999999996s)]
*  draft recap and you're like, Oh, it went Derek Henry, Saquon, Kyron Williams, and then I got [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=280.0s)]
*  Travis Etienne. Like that's the worst thing you can look back at and see. He's better when he's [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=286.08s)]
*  out because then you play someone else. When you play Travis Etienne, he gets two and a half points. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=290.71999999999997s)]
*  That's the worst possible thing. It's a farp. It's the fantasy anger replacement level. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=293.84s)]
*  This is good. So Etienne had the highest farp. I think Devontae Adams has to be on there too. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=301.44s)]
*  There's still a chance for him to salvage it, but I was surprised that he was going where he was going. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=307.12s)]
*  Fantasy anger replacement theories fart. There we go. Yeah. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=312.79999999999995s)]
*  One of the things I've noticed with fantasy and especially cause I've been doing it since 1990, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=315.44s)]
*  house is probably somewhere in the mid nineties, but we always discount the awesome receiver. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=320.47999999999996s)]
*  Who's got shit quarterbacks. And it's like, well, no, it'll be fine. It's Devontae Adams. And it's [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=325.2s)]
*  like, it actually won't be fine. He's got Etienne O'Connell and Gardner Minshew throwing the ball. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=330.56s)]
*  Guess what? It's not going to be fine. And then you watch that quarterback show and he's bitching [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=335.12s)]
*  about Garoppolo the whole time. And it's like, he's probably not going to handle this well either. So [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=339.52s)]
*  I was, that was one of the ones where I was amazed. People were talking to him. I think Debo, and I [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=344.08s)]
*  know he got hurt, but I also feel like that's a buyer beware when you're spending money on Debo [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=348.56s)]
*  because he gets hurt every year and the position that him to me, him and Puka are, if you take [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=354.16s)]
*  those guys and you watch them play football, those guys are in car collisions 10 times a game, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=359.6s)]
*  whether they're blocking or going over the middle. I don't want any part of that stuff. So I don't, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=365.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't feel bad for that. Here's the other one to have for you. Leporta. Leporta is being treated [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=369.68s)]
*  like Kelsey, right? What happened? We, we joke on our show that there are certain players that are [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=374.16s)]
*  like, did you know that there's a fourth Jonas brother? There's actually four. Is that really? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=380.72s)]
*  Yeah, I know, right? I didn't know this either. Craig told me. And we joke that there are certain [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=385.68s)]
*  players every year that are like the fourth Jonas brother. Like you look at the Detroit Lions and [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=389.12s)]
*  everyone on that team's incredible. Goff has, I mean, they have more touchdowns than Goff and [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=392.88s)]
*  completions in the last six weeks. You have Jameer Gibbs and David Montgomery are crushing. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=396.32s)]
*  Amonra St. Brown, Jameson Williams when he's not suspended is incredible. And then, oh yeah, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=400.08s)]
*  I forgot Sam Leporta is on that team. And it's like, you watch the Lions game, they put up 49 [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=404.72s)]
*  points. You're like Leporta must've done something. No, he's blocking. It's brutal. It really upsets [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=408.24s)]
*  me. I was a believer in the Kelsey theme, but we, the Kelsey is another one in that Derek Henry [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=414.24s)]
*  Lebron conversation where we always look for guys to take over Kelsey. New up on commerce. They did [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=419.52s)]
*  it with Kyle Pitts for a couple of years and, you know, Leporta super disappointing. Kinkade's on [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=424.8s)]
*  there. Waddle and Tyreek, I think both have to be on there, but you can't blame them with the two-it [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=430.88s)]
*  thing. Dude, Waddle hasn't had 50 yards since week one. Waddle, you watch the Dolphins and you forget [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=437.04s)]
*  he's on the team for like two hours. And then they'll throw him like a bubble screen and be [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=442.4s)]
*  like, Oh my God, it's Jalen Waddle. I forgot he was on the Dolphins. Mahomes. Now he's the best [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=446.23999999999995s)]
*  player in the league and they're undefeated. Well, he's one of the best players in the league [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=455.03999999999996s)]
*  because there's a real Lamar case, but it felt like his fantasy value started to bleed over with his [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=458.23999999999995s)]
*  real life value in a way that didn't really make sense because he's running less and less every [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=464.71999999999997s)]
*  year. And did you notice though, cause in all my drafts, he was more expensive than he probably [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=468.8s)]
*  should have been. Is there something to that? I think that Mahomes is so famous that yeah, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=473.52000000000004s)]
*  it affected, I mean, just to give you an idea, Mahomes, I got this from Ian Hardin's at fantasy [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=478.8s)]
*  life. Patrick Mahomes and CJ Stroud have fewer top 12 finishes this year weekly. Mahomes and Stroud, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=483.28000000000003s)]
*  fewer top 12 weekly combined than Daniel Jones. Oh my God. So that's how Patrick Mahomes is [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=490.56s)]
*  killed. Well, if you took Mahomes, that's on you because all you had to do was watch football last [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=498.56s)]
*  season. Like, you know, there, it's a different, it's a different offense, a different system, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=505.44s)]
*  a different set of weapons. Like, you know, if you took Mahomes and paid for it, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=510.24s)]
*  you get what you deserve. And I think the other disappointment was if you backed Caleb over [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=514.96s)]
*  Daniels, right? If you're like, I believe in a rookie QB Caleb, weapons, all these weapons, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=519.76s)]
*  and you just kind of overlook all the Daniels spuds, which House did not overlook. And you, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=526.88s)]
*  I hope that you probably noticed too, because that's where we live, but there was real breadcrumbs [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=531.76s)]
*  with Daniels the whole preseason. And yet there it was. He was six to one for our friends at Rookie [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=535.52s)]
*  of the Year. He was like a one or two dollar guy in fantasy drafts. Everybody kind of overlooked it. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=540.88s)]
*  I think the other thing with fantasy, I think sometimes I think the simplest way to explain why [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=545.28s)]
*  we forget the lessons we thought we learned is that it's kind of like basketball. You look back [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=549.76s)]
*  at a game and you see a score. But actually, that, you know, especially I feel like now it's a game [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=555.9200000000001s)]
*  of runs, right? Like someone was up 18 and then it gets erased and someone's up 20. And it's like, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=561.6800000000001s)]
*  and it's like fantasy. It's like, I don't know, the guy I keep thinking of is like Deandre Swift, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=566.48s)]
*  who looked like he should get benched for the first three or four weeks of the season. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=570.16s)]
*  And then in September and then in October, Deandre Swift's like a top eight running back in fantasy. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=574.5600000000001s)]
*  And it's all kind of like that. And you look at back and you look back and you remember it a [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=579.28s)]
*  certain way. But the reality is Deandre Hopkins is someone like you were saying, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=582.96s)]
*  who was released by a lot of people. And you know what? Going forward, Kansas City is the first [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=586.1600000000001s)]
*  player who's actually an A or an A plus at catching the football Patrick Holmes has ever played with [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=590.24s)]
*  at any level his entire career. And you're like, he could be a top five receiver going forward [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=595.2800000000001s)]
*  purely because he could catch the ball from my homes. And so, but we don't think of it that way [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=598.96s)]
*  when we look back. You know what I mean? We see the whole thing. We remember it a certain way. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8fX7WC-G0&t=603.12s)]
