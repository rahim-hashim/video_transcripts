# NFL MVP Favorites and Long Shots With Danny Kelly and Joe House  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [November 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fyzFtpN-_k)
*  All right. MVP odds. So the Bundle and Raheem talked about this on the Wednesday episode of the hook on the ringer gambling show.
*  Good, good title by the way. I love when we have good titles for our shows.
*  We were talking about
*  MVPs a week ago, and I thought Lamar was in the driver's seat and then they blew that stupid game on Sunday
*  and I think that knocked him out.
*  And yet I don't know who the MVP is and Fandel doesn't really seem to know either. Josh Allen's plus 270, Lamar's plus 310 with a
*  Harder schedule coming. Mahomes is five to one having probably the worst season of his career
*  Even though the Chiefs are winning. Goff's six to one. Daniels is nine to one.
*  CJ Stroud is 13 to one. The Bundle made a really interesting case for Hertz
*  at 20 to one because the next six defenses he's playing are all terrible and
*  He might be able to actually cook the next six weeks and if the Eagles go on a little run, maybe
*  Brock Purdy's 22 to one
*  goes on down the line. As you know, defensive players aren't allowed to win this award.
*  But we don't really have somebody out there. Oh, that guy's probably gonna win. Is there anybody you're looking at at this point?
*  I mean
*  Yeah, the one guy I think that I kind of just like circled there is James Daniels
*  Just because of all the narratives around him, you know, like I don't know. I don't think he'll actually-
*  Hold on, house just ejaculated. We have to take another break.
*  I don't think he will win but
*  Just you know, it's like they feel like they're the team of destiny this year almost
*  That wild, you know, game-winning throw the other day
*  Like just the way that they're playing, the way that they're executing on third and fourth down like at
*  Truly historic rates like it's probably not going to last but right now just narrative wise and excitement wise and you know
*  All that he kind of was the one that stood out there. I think the obvious one, you know
*  Thanks for sucking up the house by the way. That was yeah
*  I'm so mad I don't have them to win the division. I stared at it all summer and you asked me
*  I asked you, you know what I said? I can't name more than two players on our defense
*  Yeah, I mean I could name them and I would say they suck
*  I mean I could have named them then. I told you the defense isn't any good
*  You can't invest in the team in that preseason with that
*  Yeah
*  I started off this show talking about the Wizards as a joke because I am still
*  Coming down from the high of the miracle in Maryland. What are we talking about? It's the sea words all day, baby
*  But in these betting markets BS knows this it's a house tradition to have tickets multiple tickets
*  and I absolutely must have some some some Josh Allen because
*  That's the best. That's the most likely that's the narrative. He has deserved it in the past that makes it easy for everybody
*  I also think Jared golf if Detroit ends up at 14 and 3 and and lands the the one seed
*  I think there's a decent case and he reels off a couple more of these games where he's nearly a hundred percent
*  completion
*  Now we have to get indoors this week outdoors
*  Yeah, no sirree, but we will get back indoors for golf and then I love the hurts case
*  I think that that the Eagles are 21 good. Yeah, it's a great price and I have them. I'm a bum
*  I bought him at 16 to 1 in the summer 20 to 1 might as well double up look at that
*  Secondary for the Eagles. That's the thing for them. That's gonna turn that is slowly
*  Coming together. They are understanding a little bit of what mr
*  Fangio wants out of them and I think that Eagles defense is gonna be a propulsive
*  Kind of a force for them down down the stretch. I have a question disgusted by this. No, no, no, I think that's fine
*  I have a question
*  Fine
*  30 to 1 Jordan love is he has he missed too much time ready to win it or if you like because isn't this like typically?
*  Kind of a how you do down the stretch award
*  You'd have to win
*  He'd have to have a huge game this week against the Lions at home and beat the Lions and throw for 340 yards
*  I just think that now get it going the way that he plays the kind of like he's like effort that he's down there
*  Somewhere, you know type of attitude he has it wouldn't be all that surprising to see him go on kind of like a tear down
*  The stretch
*  Cuz I don't know not particularly but I think he could put up stats
*  I think like and he has such a he's in such a good system with so many good weapons around him
*  And I think he's been really banged up and if he gets healthy and then starts to like put it all together down the stretch
*  Again, like it's kind of like how you finish. I think a lot of the time kind of influences this and if I think the Packers are
*  Really good. I think they have one of the best play callers in the NFL and they have weapons so
*  It's a good point yeah, it's such a good point because literally last season
*  The MVP was decided on Christmas when the Ravens went in and beat the hell out of the night in every week for like
*  I'm weeks in a row right. Yeah, right. So I have a
*  Turn the camera even though it's already on
*  What is Kansas City's record
*  How high does it go before my homes just has to be the MVP like what if they go 17 and oh
*  Yeah
*  16 and one
*  They were 16 and one does he just automatically have to get it. What if they have a four win
*  advantage over every other team in the league and then we look at their actual scope position players and we're like oh
*  They have 45 year old Kelsey
*  A
*  Rookie worthy the wide rice was out the whole year. Here's Hopkins. He can't get open but I'll catch stuff in traffic
*  Juju Smith Schuster waved by the Pats a bunch of random running backs that were either on the waiver wire or not drafted like
*  Maybe it should be my homes
*  No, he has eight touchdowns and nine picks this year. I mean he's gonna end up much better. I'm sure but
*  It would be funny it would be funny if that was the case it's annoying it's too stupid the MVP
*  For the the Chiefs is the defense spag should win MVP
*  It's given to Chris Jones as a player in spags. It's just call the award the MVO
*  It's not there's no P
*  It's not for the most valuable player the most valuable players for the Chiefs are on the defensive side of the ball
*  They've been effing dominant and there's as long as they have health that I'm gonna knock on wood
*  They're for sure gonna be right, you know
*  Absolutely fine. It's how they won the Super Bowl
*  I mean that plus the seven fumbles
*  Well, can we go through their schedule here because I didn't realize this till I was doing the research last night and today
*  So they're playing Tampa Monday night big favorites
*  Denver home
*  They're at Buffalo week 11. So that's a red flagger. That's that's a possible one
*  But then they're at Carolina home Vegas home Chargers at Cleveland
*  Home Houston and then at Pittsburgh four days later
*  I would say would be the other really dangerous one and then home Denver week 18
*  But we haven't had one of these in a while where the team
*  They remember in the 2000s it felt like this was happening every year
*  Like we would have these Colts years where they were like 12 and oh the oh seven paths
*  I don't remember us having one of these in a while and I don't really know the reasons for that other than maybe there's just
*  more variance with the games now, but
*  This Chiefs team, I don't know I could see them being like 13 to know and that's kind of looking at each other
*  They're going wait. What does this mean? Does this mean did he reads the coach of the year now and Moe Holmes is MVP?
*  I don't know. I don't know the answer. What's the stat that you really like words like when he's down ten points. He's
*  Like undefeated or something like that in the fourth quarter. Moe Holmes is like that magic about him that
*  You just can't really figure out under dark. That's the best that where he's
*  So only not covered once when he's been an underdog since he's been in the league like that Brady is that the same shit
*  It's like don't make these guys underdogs. It's stupid
*  That house are you gonna say the league ruined this the league ruined the possibility of any team going undefeated?
*  Because of the stupid Wednesday Christmas game they there's no chair
*  in fact if I was involved with the Chiefs and
*  We you know we were coming into that game undefeated. I might seriously consider resting everybody on Christmas
*  I might seriously consider taking the starters letting them have Christmas with their effing families grab ten guys from the practice squad
*  Tell the NFL that would go over great
*  The point is not to win on Christmas the point is to win the Super Bowl
*  The point is to be successful in the playoffs and coming off of what is it Saturday the to Wednesday?
*  Yeah, it's it's goddamn preposterous. It's it's terrible for the players the dialogue about this
*  I remember writing multiple columns about this in the late 2000s because the Pats played it one way they went for it
*  And then they really wore down over the end of the season the playoffs and then the Colts did it the other way
*  And they were like we're throwing away
*  We don't care and then that backfire too, and it's like there's basically no way
*  You're basically best off losing in like week 11 is the way to play it so maybe they just have to throw the Buffalo game
*  but yeah, I think
*  The schedule for some reason isn't that hard especially when you have you're in the same division as Vegas and the Chargers and Denver
*  You know not to mention all the other stuff so
*  Coach of the year is another one
*  Where it just seems like it has to go to the team that are like the Dan Quinn it's like
*  Oh, they won six game five games last year. They've won 11 this year
*  He's the coach of the year, but that's another one where it's like well
*  Why shouldn't Andy Reid win this if they go 15 and two or 16 to one?
*  I would make a case for Tomlin though if they're if they're in the 12s I
*  Mean his quarterbacks are Justin Fields and Russell Wilson
*  They they're paying two and a half million dollars combined for their quarterbacks nobody nobody else in the league is doing that so I
*  They would be in there too who else would you have Danny?
*  Give me that give me like the favorites right now, so it's like Dan Quinn
*  Koc for the Vikings yeah, I have KOC up there
*  the real KOC
*  How do we feel about like I know
*  Doesn't have it right now. Oh there it is Dan Quinn's favorite plus 195
*  Sean Payton
*  Plus 650 Tomlin's plus 750 Campbell nine to one O'Connell is nine to one
*  But he's dropping and Andy Reid is nine to one even though it is never lost yet
*  So the floor at the floor at 15 to one is intriguing to be if they beat Detroit
*  And they're you know seven and two that with some the Malik Willis games, I know I think he's done a great job this year
*  yeah, I think he might have been who I picked in the preseason to win this I think because
*  I've been saying this for a few years
*  It's like he kind of like got ignored for a long time because he had Rogers and he was you know he right now
*  He only Jim Harbaugh has a better winning record among active head coaches in the NFL
*  and he's just been incredible since he was named the head coach there and people kind of just overlook him because
*  You know for a number of reasons, but I think he's proven to be
*  On par with like the McVeigh in terms of just coaching excellence scheme getting the most out of your players having like all these
*  Sort of random guys and getting the most out of them on offense like not not to say that they haven't like invested as receivers
*  But it's like second third fourth round fifth round guys, and they're all really good
*  And they're they're all getting production out of those guys and so
*  You know they're telling man. That's the game of the week on Sunday
*  That really could be the NFC title game in a couple weeks um
*  Fantasy MVP for you for the year
*  Right now it's Henry Derek Henry. I think interesting. I mean it's either Lamar Henry
*  I would have said I would have said Lamar, but I see the Henry case too because so got Henry your pain
*  Why we're a Saquon what happened to Saquon? I mean Saquon's up there as well Henry's got a thousand yards and 14 TDs
*  Yeah, Henry could break a thousand I think this week
*  But he's also just like lapping the field at the running back position in terms of points
*  He's only had I think his worst game this week or the season has been ten points
*  He's not giving you any bad weeks. Yeah, and he's giving you a bunch of spike week
*  So you know right now he has 30 almost 30 more points than Alvin Kamara total and in total points
*  Then that's the second number two running back, and I think just that value that value over
*  You know the general replacement running back is is so high
*  I think Lamar would be another good one
*  And I think you could throw Jane Daniels in there if he can stay healthy for the rest of the year
*  Right now right now. He's not probably because he missed a game
*  but
*  you know he
*  He's in terms of value because you got him relatively late, and he's just been incredible
*  He was like kind of an afterthought in a big in the in the preseason because people weren't really sure like what he would do
*  Passing he's been incredible passer in addition to you know running almost as much as any quarterback this year, so right
*  But I would I would pick Henry just based on the consistency in the spike weeks that you get from him well and also
*  I don't think he was a top eight like spending running back but heading into an auction right yeah
*  I think he was in that second level yeah
*  Yeah, because people were a little uncertain about number one the age number two
*  He's going to a new team new office like podcasts like ours where you guys are all blowing
*  Devin a Chan
*  Well Craig Craig to his credit her go back was all in on Henry this year, and that's yeah
*  That's really aged well
*  Henry's turned into like just just keep taking him until the year when he doesn't have it anymore because it usually happens with the receivers
*  but not
*  not a
*  Running backs he's the extreme outlier in every sense house
*  I didn't even tell you my knockout league the what I mean not the league you're in but the league with sound
*  No, no, this is the knockout league with
*  That one yeah, I have my teams a disaster I
*  Had Kurt Cousins as one of my quarterbacks after week one when he looked like a mannequin in an apartment store window I
*  Cut him
*  Somebody else up yeah, I'm two and six basically. I'm probably at the playoffs anyway, but it's like nobody's finished me off yet
*  And now I'm going against Kurt Cousins. It's the rare fantasy
*  Oh
*  The guy I never should have waved now. I'm good
*  So I fully expect him to have four touchdowns and 700 yards you miss out on his 900 yards
*  And I know it's a chance against Tampa's amazing so upset
*  Yeah, go ahead provided the most content on the fantasy show this year. What what single-player?
*  Oh, that's a great rate for players on the show that you've spent the most times talking about who is it?
*  That's a really good question
*  I mean it's always Kyle Pitts pretty much every year for some reason we just can't this guy he is sir
*  He's the third has had it right now. I know he's been back. He's been playing well
*  He we have a whole category dedicated to him usually it's
*  Two tight ends and a lie basically two tight ends that outscored Kyle Pitts and a lie
*  And it's always just these random guys that outscore Kyle Pitts, but we retired the category because he's back
*  He's actually good now, and I think we're actually kind of in on this I would say
*  One more thing on pits not only is he really good. He's had a couple long plays called back
*  Yeah, I don't which I don't know is there a website that keeps track of that
*  I I know cuz I have him in my guillotine league and one other league
*  But he he's had two like long ones where he was like celebrating and they're like ah flag in the play
*  Yeah, that the king of that is George Pickens. Yeah, no question. The cow piss is probably second cow pits
*  I think that play last week where he caught a pass
*  He like did the reverse stiff arm, you know the Larry Fitzgerald cell
*  We kept the ball out and almost fumbled it and then he almost ball that going over the right up to the point
*  We come on like right up to the point where he almost dropped the ball too earlier. Maybe he did actually definitely did
*  Yeah, I was like that was the first time in like years
*  I'm like, oh, there's the Kyle Pitts that like we thought he was gonna be that's the guy that you know
*  The Falcons took before Jamar chase
*  and so
*  Yeah, it's good. I think he's a good guy
*  Yeah, it's good to see him back. He finally starts to look a little healthy
*  But you know, he's still kind of his his target rate isn't really where you want it to be
*  He's still kind of like a tertiary option in this Falcons offense like Darnell Mooney's Barbie
*  I think outscoring him still so can't get too excited about it
*  How so you excited for Brock Bowers to be a $35 tied up next year? He deserves it. He's incredible
*  I want to ask Danny a question as we formulate strategies for next year and what we're seeing over this season in terms of running
*  Backperformance are we going to go back to where we were maybe a decade ago where receivers?
*  You know because we're in this era now where there's three receivers going in the first round of all drafts. Mm-hmm and
*  There are no receivers now
*  Who's the top like fans like you know, it would have been Nico and Nico was incredible what he was doing all season
*  But this is the issue now that receivers get hurt
*  I mean running backs do too, but are we gonna go back?
*  Is it just gonna be ten running backs that then everybody's gonna scrap from there? Yeah, maybe
*  I mean this I want to say I don't have the sound from me, but I think
*  And a receiver production across the NFL is down dramatically this year compared to most years
*  And I think it's just like there's a lot of these variables
*  Quarterbacks are not playing as well not nearly as efficient like all these passes are so much shorter
*  basically teams are
*  You know using these little swing passes and short passes to replace the run game more or less
*  The problem is on the other side running backs are not being used at a high rate as they used to like you know
*  I mean, there's like every team almost now has a pretty strong rotation
*  there's a handful of guys that are you know, the quote-unquote workhorse type players, but
*  You know, it's it's give-and-take. I would say next year. We're probably gonna see because of all this
*  We're probably gonna see like a running backpack first round
*  It's just gonna be those guys that are gonna get like 20 carries a game it and those they're so scarce you have to go
*  Get them. How about this? Maybe Lamar should just be the first pick in the draft. I
*  know right
*  Like if you're just trying to if you were calling people and asking to try to trade for guys on their team
*  I think Lamar is the quickest hang up. Yeah, like fuck you. I'm not trading Lamar guys
*  Amazing when he's when he spent all that or when he lost all that weight this offseason
*  I think that should have been like the biggest
*  Sign to be like, okay, he's back. He's gonna be you know doing his thing running around like making guys look stupid
*  I think when he gained a little bit of weight, he wasn't quite as elusive as a runner. Yeah
*  But but yeah, he's he's been absolutely incredible house. This guy might be up there too. And I'll tell you this
*  My guy Drake may I hope he plays this week
*  But he looks he's gonna put a big fantasy stats cuz is running
*  like he he scoots out and and also like isn't afraid to like
*  run down the middle of the field and take a hit or two which unfortunately backfired on him last week, but
*  I think he made he's a big game hunter
*  And also is gonna run the ball 30 to 50 yards, but it seems like we we might have nailed all three of those quarterbacks
*  Yeah
*  Dean if you had to rank the quarterbacks right now for who you'd want would would
*  Drake may versus Caleb in the two-spot. Who would you pick?
*  Probably still Caleb that maybe that's just take lock from from like my draft analysis or whatever, but I
*  Don't know Drake looks really good man. He he like I think he kind of for whatever reason people overlooked
*  How good of a runner he was he was yeah, he put up that man. He put up stats in college as a runner
*  And he was like scrambling around a bunch. He was really dangerous in the red zone. He's almost got like
*  You know like a little bit of a Josh Allen to him where he's almost a little too reckless to which is a little nervous
*  nervous makes me nervous, but
*  But yeah, I mean he looks really good out there and obviously with a little more experience and get some weapons around him
*  He has like no weapons right now. So that doesn't help but
*  Yeah, he could definitely have like an elite upside in the league. I still just I don't know
*  I still I still love Caleb for just the special plays he can make out of structure
*  I think and he'll start to figure it out a little bit more in structure. I think that offensive system is
*  You know a work in progress
*  For them do your Bears rant just no I'm a spurt 20 seconds
*  I can't I can't I mean they're literally the dumbest football team
*  Next next to the Jets. It's an incredible
*  slew of
*  Immense geniuses in charge on both sides of the football plus special teams
*  But the thing I wanted to share and I know it's obviously insane
*  I think that if you grab Caleb or you grab Drake May and you put them with Cliff Kingsbury this season
*  With this offensive line and the way that they have schemed up that that any of those guys might look f-ing incredible this year
*  Yeah in Washington, which is a bananas thing to say I know it sounds insane
*  The only thing with Daniels
*  He's so accurate. It's just outrageous like to to have him on one TV and Anthony Richardson on another TV
*  It was like watching two different sports
*  You know like his passes are just always in the perfect spot
*  Whether it's a deep ball whether it's a little quick out like I and I knew that was though
*  You know that was part of the appeal for him coming out of college, but it's really true like
*  There's accuracy and then there's like pinpoint pinpoint accuracy which he seems to really have
