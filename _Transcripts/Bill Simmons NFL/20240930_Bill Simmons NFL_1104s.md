# NFL Guess the Lines Week 5 with Cousin Sal  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPRBzynlJ0)
*  Guess the lines week five. I'm up to one with with a tie. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we have some buys this week
*  Yeah, the first who is it Detroit Chargers, Philly, Tennessee?
*  Chargers needed to buy
*  Tennessee might need to buy after well, I guess we'll find out tomorrow and then the Eagles might be using the buy to get rid of their coach
*  ooh
*  Why doesn't that up? Why don't they put the odds up like the first fire?
*  Yeah, well, it's a positive company they stand for right but you could you can bet how many?
*  Interceptions a quarterback has what's the difference you can bet who's gonna come in last place in the beginning of the year?
*  I was thinking how funny would be if Belichick just was the Eagles coach in like two days and all of his media jobs that
*  He had I was just like all right
*  He had to leave this one and this one's out and this one's also gone. He still doesn't he does everything
*  He just he keeps the jobs and coaches
*  Or they or they hire like Darrell Hammond to play Belichick and just yeah, he's done
*  That's a pretty good Belichick. Well, you know, you know CJ Stroud is just he's just fantastic looking downfield
*  There's nobody better
*  Thursday night
*  We're going back to Atlanta. I love that. They were the dirty bird jerseys today. Those are so those black
*  I felt I saw they were wearing those and actually ended up throwing them in a tease because I got excited because of that
*  Wow, yeah, I was like, I can't see them losing with those but all right it worked
*  Falcons home for the Bucs. This is good for my NFC South bet
*  Only one team can win
*  It's gonna be a tie a tie would be the best if I get a tie. Oh, that's right zero, right? Right? That'd be great
*  I
*  Have a lot of trouble this one I ended up with because it's Thursday. I bumped it up a point to Falcons minus two and a half
*  I had trouble too because I have no idea what they're wearing for this one. So I almost passed on it and
*  Good cheating you have it exactly. It's two and a half. I said one I
*  Think you I think they're adding a point for Thursday's
*  Adding ones really? Okay. Yeah, so instead of one and a half point advantage
*  I'm not actually doing it but I just assume I think there's a home field something on Thursday's because it's four days after the last games
*  And it's time to travel
*  Maybe Sunday marquee game
*  You'd be could either go Vikings Jets or Bills Texans, what's well you want to knock that out because that's the London game Jets and Vikings
*  Good point. You can't start over. So that can't be no that can't be
*  The Sunday marquee game because that's I should have put right in the London category. Yeah
*  Well, it could be marquee
*  So Bills Texans is the one again
*  No, no Vikings Jets is the one again Vikings Jets. Yeah, screw me up. Yeah
*  Vikings technically home
*  Vikings by three
*  All right, that's what I said it's two and a half
*  I wonder if that was in Minnesota. What do you think the line is?
*  It's got to be four or a little north of four, right? Yeah, I would say four. Yeah, so here's the thing
*  This is where I am emotionally as you know, I told you I wasn't gonna be betting on Thursday games
*  Or games in weird countries this year not that London's a weird country. I actually like London
*  I really want to bet the Vikings in this game
*  After watching Rogers today and seeing how much trouble he had moving and then watching that Vikings defense
*  I think this is a really tough spot for him
*  Mm-hmm. I just think they're gonna be coming at him blitzes all kinds of shit. Just trying to make a go uncomfortable. I
*  Had to be honest, I don't think he wants to be hit anymore
*  We've seen quarterbacks get to this point Brady got to this point the last couple years his career where it was like
*  You know is a big game because he started taking hits
*  Drew Brees got to that point. I don't think Rogers wants to be hit like that anymore
*  and there was I thought he bailed out of some plays in the
*  last part of the game the quarter and a half I watched but he was just his
*  His process is just a little faster. He's not waiting that extra second anymore. This Vikings teams a nightmare for him
*  I'm with you. I was I'm taking to anyone. It's the Vikings, right?
*  But this is the NFL right like this is where you get screwed up. And the one thing I'll say about
*  Rogers if you worry about him bouncing back on three days rest, I know it was against the Patriots
*  You're gonna go into how bad they were but he did do it against the Pats a couple weeks ago
*  Yeah, but you're but you're right. He looks like he had that look like what the hell have I done here coming back?
*  And also now he's going at it with Salah about the cadence Salah doesn't like some of his cadences apparently
*  And that of course got out immediately so good times that couldn't have gotten out faster
*  All right. So we'll go for the traditional Sunday marquee game bills Texans
*  Yeah, pretty good game Josh Allen against CJ Straub. It's in Houston
*  And I have the bills minus one and a half
*  damn it
*  Got it. I had bills by one. I really wanted to get that one from you Simmons. I gotta be honest
*  All right, both three and one
*  This is
*  The leading candidate for the overreaction game a week five
*  Because I could see the Texans doing really well
*  Yeah, and then it's like oh remember when we thought Jack we gave Josh Allen the MVP after three games and we rode off Houston now
*  He's since got their shit together or the other way where the bills look good
*  And now we're concerned with Houston the bills are fine. The Ravens game was weird
*  Josh is the MVP favorite again something there will be no reaction
*  Well, you understand the entire middle of their defense is susceptible to anything you want to do any part run pass
*  Oh, any part of the field want to punt in there. Yeah, you're good
*  one watchable Ravens at
*  Cincinnati
*  The Ravens are certainly to be favored after what happened today. I have Ravens minus two and a half
*  All right, I get this
*  I had but exactly actually one and a half Ravens are favored
*  That's gonna be my default guess I think on a lot of for now on one and a half sounds good
*  I actually put that down a bunch because it just seems like that's the line over and over again. Mm-hmm
*  Bengals home dog one of that we're gonna have a week where some of these home dogs just start crushing
*  fairly watchables I
*  Have to put Pat's Dolphins on here because I think we're getting Drake may
*  Know that might even argue make it a watchable Drake mays first start Kyle noticed in the game today
*  They were showing him on the sidelines a lot more in the first half
*  Yeah, they kept like just showing him on the headset. There he is
*  This could be his last time in the sidelines
*  Could we call this a wearable like Kyle wears his jersey for this?
*  Is it a wearable know if he has a Drake major as yet? Well, just does he take I mean does he like
*  Did you actually wear a jersey? Oh, yeah, Drake may is playing Kyle will have the jersey on. Okay. Yeah, he will
*  So
*  I
*  Don't see any scenario where the Pats can be favored in this game
*  No matter who the quarterback is even though I know who the
*  Dolphins are gonna probably have Huntley. Mm-hmm. I just don't think the Pats can be favored
*  So I'm gonna have the Dolphins by one
*  All right, you're gonna get it. I mean this is where I should have got one and a half
*  I said two and a half it is Dolphins by one and a half. So you're closer
*  It's another one and a half four to two, you know, it's gonna ruin guess the lines of every line is one and a half I
*  Could tell you if it is or isn't but well, by the way screw this our next game
*  I guess one and a half it is jaguars at home against the Colts jaguars own forward and somehow I think they're gonna be favored
*  I have jaguars by one and a half. All right, I got this exactly. It's three jaguars are three-point favorite. That's too high
*  They're clearly on the kitchen sink he needs his pass
*  No, it's three kitchen sinks in a row no own four teams made the playoffs in 23 two years
*  Yeah, but is it flacco? I mean it's looking like flacco against Lawrence
*  I guess it's better for the Colts the Richardson hit looked bad today because it hit him in his hip and
*  He went down. I was like, oh fucking a this guy got hurt again
*  And then he came back in the they ran a little bootleg play for him
*  And he went down before he got hit because it seemed like this hit so that I don't know
*  I just I didn't that's this would be his third injury. So it's tough to watch monitor that one
*  Let me ask you this I was gonna save this
*  Yeah, if flacco, I don't know how you feel about him with the Hall of Fame not making it in your head right now
*  But if he takes the Colts to the playoffs if they snuck in at like nine and eight
*  Yeah, I kind of think he may have my vote
*  I'll have to look at the class coming in and everything but for God's sakes fix the Browns and the Colts
*  This is the Derrick Rose argument in the NBA now Derrick Rose won the MVP in 2011. Yeah, I'm sorry
*  Good everyone who's ever won the MVP is in the Hall of Fame and Rose has a chance to be the first guy who didn't
*  Make it and there's yeah, and he's not a Hall of Famer, but the MVP thing would make
*  Mm-hmm might be able to sway it
*  The run he had
*  Which was the greatest four-round run any quarterbacks had in the playoffs right combined with some of the other stuff
*  You could argue he he's at least in the conversation. I mean he had a better career than Eli Manning
*  Yeah
*  But Eli had those two post seasons and he made it. I know I know
*  Take him to let's see what happens Joe. Come on. We're not eviscerating you
*  We're not eviscerating you take take the Colts of playoffs an anti evisceration, right?
*  49ers are home for the Cardinals and
*  Before the game before the late games today, I guess 49ers by four and
*  after that I switched it to 49ers by
*  Six and a half at home in its gardens dirtbag. You sure you don't want to switch it back
*  I don't a lot of times your first impression. I don't I said two points
*  I never do yeah, that was way off and I said five at seven and a half. So you get oh Jesus
*  Yeah, that's well. This is where this is where the Cardinals thrive
*  Yeah, right. Like oh my god. I want to be huge underdogs and there's a back door cover possibly great
*  Washington's home for the Browns
*  It's gonna be a big Jade and Daniels fest all week
*  They're gonna be replaying Deshaun Watson and Jamis Winston getting mad at the offensive tackle all week and talking about what do they do?
*  Do they have any outs? I
*  Think I squeezed this to three
*  Washington by three
*  At home against Cleveland. I wanted to go two and a half. I think it's three
*  Wanted to steal this from it. I have exactly three and it is exactly three
*  It's fairly and really you think it's fair. No, cuz I wrote this that gets a three and a half
*  It's my mistake with it. But I
*  Mean who's been in Cleveland here?
*  Who's betting them?
*  Do they score does Cleveland scored 27 points
*  So you had Cleveland in the playoffs and they're one and three
*  Yeah, I know we don't have and I wrote down because they're 11 weeks 11 through 18 are an absolute gauntlet
*  And I wrote down in my notes before the year. They'd have to go four and one in their first five games
*  And they're one and three so are you out on that it's close. Yeah
*  I think I'm out but I swear I would like I would like to see James
*  I'd like to see what they did we talked about how admitting defeat with this dumb signing
*  This but the fake sure to save face. Just keep going. Yeah, sure. I'm I'm out of it. Yeah
*  But I'm obviously out of the Jaguars Jaguars was my they're going 10 and 7
*  They're not on them to possible five. I have disowned them. You're still holding that hope on the Raiders. I
*  Am a little bit. Yeah, just a little bit someone has to sneak in there
*  I
*  Think the Bears at home for the Panthers
*  So the Bears are favored by three against the depleted Rams
*  This week and I added a half point made it Bears minus three and a half for the Panthers
*  You know something happened here because it was three and a half kickoff of the late game tonight
*  And it went to four and a half. I get it. I said four. Okay, I swear that all this went on
*  I believe you I don't know what happens there an injury is
*  Is there maybe people realize the Panthers aren't good and there's another redhead coming in the defense. I have no idea
*  yeah, Broncos are home for the Raiders and
*  This is a terrible game. I hope I don't have to watch too much of it
*  I have the Broncos favored by one and a half. Wow, you got it one and a half is sweet
*  Yeah, I went the other way. I thought the Raiders would be favored
*  I thought Denver would be suffering from what you said about Arizona like I got it. Thanks, but no, thanks
*  We're not we're not ready to be favored, but I guess it doesn't work like that. I
*  Wonder Devante Adams does this hamstring just kind of hurt until they trade him. So one of those
*  In this week, I don't know still hurts
*  Smart can't really push off it. Just kind of waiting. Who's the team? Could it be KC?
*  With those two teams trade together
*  Well, that's all I was gonna say is he stole is it stole about going to the Jets and playing with Aaron Rogers?
*  Listen, that's not what the Jets need right? I mean they can't get the body Garrett Wilson. I don't know if Casey
*  That would be big Casey. No Casey could fit him
*  They will need to receiver that is in the running
*  Buffalo has all the cap stuff. They can't really do it. Maybe the Chargers
*  Cowboys won't have enough money. I'm being selfish
*  uh
*  commanders
*  Bengals don't need I
*  Don't know man. There's I think I think you're coming. You're done with their chemistry. I'm just trading for the bot. Yeah. Yeah out of nowhere
*  Okay, I don't know yeah, I don't even know I'm looking at the slate not sure Steelers oh
*  Yeah, still over them. Yeah. Yeah
*  Seahawks are home for the Giants this I have is one of the highest lines of the week
*  I've see Hawks minus six I
*  Had it exactly I swear five and a half. Mm-hmm. Who's winning one two three six?
*  You were up seven six
*  I really want to last two so I could eviscerate you wait. There's three three left, right?
*  Three left do you do Green Bay Rams?
*  Boy
*  You lose if you didn't do it you lose that one well you lose that where's that game
*  That didn't make my notes. I should I should just lie to you. Is that an automatic loss for me? That's out here
*  It's in LA now, of course, you could guess enough. I mean, I bet that you're gonna hit this exactly now
*  Green Bay, man, the Rams I'm gonna put this in the Fairly Watchables
*  I'm gonna have the Packers favored and just just for
*  Hilarity sake Packers by one and a half. All right
*  Well, we tie on that then because I did have one and a half. It's three and a half. That's oh my god
*  It's a big number
*  Did the Rams have any more injuries today?
*  You didn't take their Rams defense look good. I mean neither one look good. No. Yeah rims do not look good Sunday night
*  You're stupid team
*  You're gonna win here play in Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh
*  So I think the line should be three and a half, but I guess three because I think people will bet Dallas
*  So I have Steelers by three. Oh
*  You know, that's crazy because I had Dallas by one
*  And it's Steelers by one and a half so you do get it
*  But you were it seems like you were off more than I was I guess you weren't well
*  Yeah, you picked the wrong team to be favored. I would argue you when does that matter? Why should that matter? I?
*  Think this line goes to two and a half
*  I am I you know, it's Sunday night, but I feel like
*  I'm maybe
*  Outrageously optimistic a little bit here
*  Because my thing with the Steelers now is can you score 20? Well, their running backs are banged up
*  That was the big they didn't have Jalen Warren today
*  Patterson was really good in the first like hour and a half of the game then he got hurt. It was just Naji Harris. That's it
*  So and they're missing they have some offensive line injuries, so you're catching them on a good week
*  I don't care if they have Jerome Bettis
*  I don't care. I don't care if they have nature on refried means in there. It doesn't matter
*  That's from our producer Jack Wilson. He texted me that was another
*  refried
*  Refried me nature on means. Yeah, I don't know the
*  Yeah, but isn't that gonna be the thing with the Steelers every week?
*  score 20
*  Yeah gets a 20
*  Good matchup fun matchup good to see the uniforms again brings back a lot of it is alright
*  I think there was some Super Bowls there. Yep, but it had chiefs Saints
*  you automatically has to be thrown into the Vegas zone and
*  I did I just went straight middle of the Vegas own chiefs by five at home against the Saints
*  You get it I said four and a half it's five and a half now this will go down
*  You win ten seven shit three weeks in a row for me
*  How am I get worse in this? I'm you know put me down for one and a half for everything
*  I'm blind betting everything next week one and a half. I don't know which side his Niners patch. You're going one and a half
*  Yep, I don't care
