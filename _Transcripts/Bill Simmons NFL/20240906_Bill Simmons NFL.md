# BradyBelichick Talking Head Predictions With Peter Schrager  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxC13_YNrc8)
*  So your biggest zag of the 2024 season mine, I'll give you mine first.
*  So, you know, I have Pittsburgh in the playoffs.
*  I think Pittsburgh's defense is the best unit of all the defenses in either
*  conference and that's Tomlin plus the defense plus Wilson just not turning the
*  ball over ever.
*  And they're just going to grind out these wins, including potentially week one in
*  Atlanta. And I'm just, I'm in on the nobody believes in us with them and I'm
*  alone.
*  House is semi there at least for week one with me, but I'm basically alone and
*  even Steele fans are like, no, we're fucked.
*  Our offensive lines at shambles, Russ sucks.
*  We won receiver like that bad pick.
*  You're wrong.
*  So that's my zag.
*  What's your number one zag?
*  Seattle in the playoffs in a loaded.
*  I feel like you have people with you on that because I bet them to win the
*  division, make the playoffs and go over.
*  You and I and a few others, but like it is.
*  It's crickets out there for the Seattle and FCS because the fact that like
*  everyone looks at them and there's a 37 year old head coach and they don't
*  really what's on defense, but like that's how old he is.
*  37 Mike McDonald.
*  37.
*  Wow.
*  His story is crazy.
*  How many coaches are you older than?
*  I know it's getting there now.
*  You have a couple, right?
*  McVeigh, McDonald.
*  Yeah.
*  McVeigh is still like 31 years old.
*  There's another one that was, I think Cali, Brian Callahan in Tennessee.
*  I'm older than that.
*  How was the Mico Ryan's?
*  It's Mico Ryan's were probably the same.
*  No, I'm probably older.
*  I remember when he was drafted.
*  So yeah, probably older.
*  So 37, wow.
*  37 and his story is crazy.
*  He was a GA, which is like graduate assistant at Georgia in like 2013 and
*  like rose up really quickly.
*  And then was it the Michigan Wolverines when they were really good on
*  defense a couple of years ago, they were like, oh, I'm going to go to the
*  And then was it the Michigan Wolverines when they were really good on
*  defense a couple of years ago, the Ravens bring him back because he was in
*  Baltimore and then they bring him back and then he gets this thing.
*  But like he's 37 and he hires this grub who they don't have a history who was
*  Washington's offensive coordinator with Pennex and Polk and a Dunze and
*  McMillan and that awesome offense that Washington had.
*  And he's like, he didn't even know the guy.
*  They didn't have any real relationship.
*  And he's like, I'm going to get a college offensive coordinator and make him
*  the NFL one here.
*  And I just feel like there's no buzz about them at all.
*  And my zag was putting them in the playoffs.
*  But if you've got them winning the division, then I will tip my cap.
*  I didn't.
*  I picked the Niners in the vision.
*  I'm just saying I put they were plus six 50, I think to win the NFC West.
*  So I just sprinkled some on that.
*  And then the other one I has, I have the Broncos making it, which I can't
*  even give you a rhyme or reason.
*  And I looked at that.
*  I want to do that so badly.
*  Isn't it fun?
*  Isn't it fun when you look at it forever?
*  I just couldn't get past the schedule, which I thought was a little harder
*  than I wanted it to be for the fact that they weren't good last year.
*  But they actually would they go seven and eight, nine?
*  Yeah.
*  So they didn't even get a fourth place schedule.
*  Remember they beat Buffalo.
*  But the cap, those teams, and this is my fear with Buffalo too.
*  And I had Bill's fans in my life for you just fucking hate Buffalo.
*  I was like, I wanted to pick Buffalo.
*  I wanted to zag with them for the AFC East all year.
*  But then the combo of all the money that is just dead cap, but it's 61 million
*  in dead cap.
*  And then when Milano got hurt, I'm like, I'm out.
*  I just, this is a too tall of a task.
*  And you know, they lean into that.
*  They love that.
*  So I talked to those guys and they're like, I'm like, you know, digs a big
*  loss, Gabe Davis.
*  And they're like, okay.
*  I'm like, what?
*  Dalton Kincaid had like 90 catches last year.
*  Well, the thing is they think and the digs thing, and I'm not trying to make
*  news here, but like it's one of those, it was time.
*  And it's like, he said that there's just like, and it's just like, imagine just a
*  cloud lifted.
*  And it's not because they don't like each other personally, but like for the
*  quarterback, it's like, oh my God, fine.
*  All right.
*  Now it's like, I get there wherever do whatever.
*  And they think out long, but it's all right.
*  Digs caught two balls in the AFC championship game.
*  I think like eight targets, like something crazy.
*  So it's like, let's see what else we have out there or AFC division around.
*  And they've got the Shakir and they've got Keon Coleman.
*  And I think they think they're going to be all right on offense.
*  They're, I mean, the, the case against it is they're, I hate relying on rookie
*  receivers like that as somebody who is as Pat's fans, Jalen Polk's going to have
*  a hundred catches.
*  Well, I'm actually excited for him, but as we had so many guys with the Pats that
*  we had to like keep our fingers crossed and the guys just sucked.
*  And it really does seem, once you get to that 25 to 50 wide receiver range, just
*  feels like a coin flip.
*  Yeah.
*  You're hoping you go back and look at the history and it's like, yeah, there's
*  AJ Brown, but there's Nikhil Harry and it just does this.
*  Totally.
*  So out of all those receivers, everybody loves everybody, but a couple of them
*  are going to be bus like the get on the, on the Panthers, Keon Coleman, Jalen
*  Polk, Pierce all of course has the, like two of those guys are going to end up
*  sucking.
*  It's just the law of averages.
*  That's how it goes.
*  The wait, can we go back to Seattle?
*  Yeah, I I'm into Seattle.
*  One of the things I liked about them.
*  Well, they actually have like a semblance of a home field advantage if they have a
*  good team, but you know, they have loaded position groups, like they're receivers.
*  They're one, two, three are up there.
*  The Ohio state, like Jackson spent like they rave about this guy and he barely
*  scratched the surface last year.
*  They have, they had two first round picks last year and the first round pick they
*  got this year.
*  Who's really a lottery pick.
*  Murphy's amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  He went 16, but he should have been top 10.
*  No doubt.
*  But so they're bringing in blue chippers finally.
*  And, uh, and I like Gino.
*  I don't mind Gino.
*  Gino's not going to lose you games.
*  Like, and then it sounds like a back end of compliment, but like he's going to keep
*  you in every game.
*  And if your team doesn't make mistakes, you will win you games.
*  Well, and then ever, I mean, Walker has been one of the biggest buzz guys of the
*  year.
*  Everyone's in on them.
*  Also, I was early on it.
*  Like the fantasy drafts were nuts.
*  He was going in the forties.
*  I wonder sometimes it's like, and it's not just me.
*  I know on yours, I think it might've been Danny Kelly was also big on him too.
*  Cause I listened to that podcast with the three of them.
*  But like, I, I, you know, I talked to Mike about it obviously in the summer and then
*  someone made me aware of this, which was interesting when he was at Michigan state,
*  Kenneth Walker, he ran for two 91 and five touchdowns in an upset of Michigan and just
*  tore them up to, oh, against Mike McDonald, defensive coordinator.
*  So like, I know that's like, all right, what does that have to do with Seahawks versus
*  49ers?
*  It does.
*  It's just like.
*  Like Donald had options.
*  He interviewed, he could have taken, it's like, that was one of the cornerstones of
*  this team.
*  So they feel really strong about him.
*  They liked that Charbonne as the other running back.
*  He's a good backup.
*  Good.
*  The thing is, I don't know how to scout a left guard.
*  Yeah, I wouldn't.
*  I don't really know.
*  There's linebacker stuff where I'm like, oh, I'm sure that guy's awesome.
*  I could tell that Fred Warner's awesome.
*  There's other guys on the TV.
*  I can't tell.
*  But with running backs, you can just kind of tell who has it.
*  You know, Lombardi and I always talk about that.
*  We're always like, why doesn't that guy play more?
*  Yeah.
*  And Walker was one of those guys.
*  When you watch the game, you're like, that guy seems awesome.
*  Why don't they give him the ball?
*  Briceau's like that.
*  I mean, some of the ones make sense.
*  There's other ones like the guy in the Bengals, the backup, Chase Brown.
*  Oh, Chase Brown.
*  Yeah.
*  He played at the end of the season really well.
*  I like Chase Brown.
*  Yeah.
*  And there's a reason Joe Mixon.
*  I took him in at least one of my drafts.
*  But like, there's certain guys where like, man.
*  I like that guy.
*  McLaughlin on the Broncos was another one.
*  That's my guy.
*  And then last year, my other guy, and this is it's late for fantasy, but I'm like a big
*  Tajay Spears guy.
*  He's Tennessee's number two.
*  Again, Tennessee might not be that great, but total like change of pace guy out of Tulane
*  and like they love him there.
*  So like, that's the kind of guy where you're like, oh, well, Tony Pollard's there.
*  So he's not going to get carries.
*  He will.
*  Like he'll get carries.
*  Can I ask you more juju questions?
*  Yeah.
*  What's how we feeling about the vibes in Cleveland?
*  What's the word in the street?
*  Yeah.
*  It's weird, isn't it?
*  And it's like, they could be the best team in the AFC on paper.
*  They're loaded.
*  Deshaun Watson.
*  I don't know.
*  I honestly don't.
*  And you hear that he looks good in practice.
*  So they changed the offense.
*  They changed the offensive coordinator.
*  But Bill Callahan's not there anymore, who I thought is really important.
*  He was the offensive line guy.
*  And if Vrabel is there.
*  Vrabel comes in.
*  I don't know what he's doing.
*  I don't know what Vrabel's role is.
*  How is he not hosting a show with Belichick?
*  It could have been the seventh Belichick show.
*  Can we talk about that?
*  Is Belichick here?
*  Oh, Belichick's on our show.
*  I mean, he's going to be doing news updates for Good Morning Football.
*  I'm not like, does he know the word no?
*  What's going on?
*  I think Belichick, he knows he's coaching in February.
*  Yep.
*  He's got it.
*  Already you think?
*  The Belichick podcast should have been called the Six Month Money Grab.
*  He's just like, do you have a check?
*  Oh, I'm happy to talk.
*  But I don't think he, I'm watching this because I really want to see in week one.
*  Because you got to do it 22 weeks for seven different outlets.
*  I do it for like four and I got nothing left.
*  But here's the thing.
*  He's going to have to actually be critical and I don't know if he's going to do it.
*  Especially if he's coming back.
*  If he's coming back, because we've seen it.
*  We've seen all kinds of versions of this with basketball and football, especially in basketball where the guys, they do TV for a year or two years.
*  They straddle it and they're nice.
*  Yeah, and they just don't, they don't want to really say anything because they might coach again.
*  That's why I love having Doc on because Doc.
*  Doc would say things.
*  Yeah, he has no self edit button.
*  Pat Riley was really good way back when he did studio.
*  He was great.
*  It was before your time.
*  But it's really rare.
*  Him and Peter Vesey and Bob Costas.
*  Like what was it?
*  First year I think it was just him and Costas.
*  But he was really good.
*  Yeah.
*  And I want to see with Belichick when we come out of week one.
*  See like we, I worked with Sean Payton for that one year and that would be the perfect thing because Payton knew he was coming back.
*  He was a little careful.
*  He was, but right out of the gate he's like, I don't believe in Tua.
*  And like it made crazy news.
*  And I'm like, I pulled him aside and I'm like, oh, that's going to be headline.
*  It's like, why don't I?
*  Yeah, but when you say it, and then from there, he kind of learned his lesson.
*  Right back in here that again, you know, like, right.
*  It was like, and I don't Belichick out of the gates, how they're using him.
*  I watched inside the NFL and it was like, all right, what is Baltimore Casey?
*  What's Baltimore I do to win this game?
*  He's like, well, you can't have Travis Kelsey go nine for 96 in the first half.
*  And like, let's say the three other guys who, you know, bless them, whatever.
*  But it's like Chris Long, Ryan Clark and like hanging on every word.
*  Watching him do film study.
*  And I'm like, that is cool.
*  There's a put, but if you're doing seven different, is he going to be that guy on all these?
*  And then McAfee, he's a little lighter.
*  And we laugh about the Insta face and all that stuff.
*  But like, I don't know what I necessarily am looking for.
*  I know what I want.
*  What do you want?
*  Is him ripping to shit?
*  Like, I don't want the ripping.
*  I want, if he's really going to be good at this, I want him to be like, all right, the Jaguars beat the Dolphins week one.
*  Let me tell you.
*  I'm going to look at the tape.
*  Watch what they did against Tua because Tua, he's good at this, but he's bad at this.
*  So when he's out there, you want to make him roll to his right and like explain to us like how he would coach against Tua.
*  If he does that, he's going to be good.
*  He was fantastic with McAfee at the draft because Drake may get spiky.
*  Like, look, this is a bad pass.
*  I thought he was awesome.
*  Yeah.
*  And then there was nothing where he was critical of something like.
*  So that gave me hope that he might be good at this.
*  But I see seven different outlets.
*  And I'm like, well, are you giving underdog fantasy your fastball or are you giving 33rd team your fastball or is it on the manning cast or are you just going to be a comedian with all of them?
*  Because now he's suddenly this like comedian that they all want to bring on and do jokes about.
*  So, you know, so I'm with you.
*  And Kyle Brant made a great point today on the show.
*  He's like, because we had to talk about like, oh, Phil Belichick's finally on social media and we all laugh and do things.
*  And Kyle's like, I kind of miss the Belichick that I knew for the last 25 years.
*  That's like, I'm not going on social media and I'm not this warm and fuzzy guy.
*  I'm the smartest football mind in the world.
*  Let's tap into that.
*  So maybe we're doing too much sports media, but like I'm fascinated.
*  No, I.
*  What this little sabbatical is like, because I agree.
*  I think it's coming back next year.
*  Listen, this is one of the big stories that the two biggest sports media for football season.
*  Him and Brady, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Will Brady be good?
*  Will Belichick?
*  It's funny that they're linked together again.
*  Have you offered your I'm sure Brian Curtis had an awesome article this week.
*  Have you had your thoughts on Brady publicized yet?
*  Like how you think it's going to go or no?
*  Have you done any talking on it?
*  Because I had a pretty cool experience where Fox flies us all out to this Terra Naya, this like nice spot in the palace.
*  They put any Fox is great.
*  They put anyone who like is on air or is a director or producer and they put us up and it's like an off site and it's required and straight and has to be there.
*  And you can tell with Carissa and Aaron, right?
*  We do.
*  Yeah, we hang with those are great.
*  They're great.
*  Great.
*  Shout out to those two.
*  Love them.
*  And it's like it's it's work, but it's also fun.
*  You play golf, but you also do like these breakout sessions.
*  And I'm at a dinner the first night and I see Brady.
*  He's looming.
*  He's like there and there's people like, you know, he was at a table with maybe like Menafee and Howie Long.
*  And at my table was Gronk and Edelman and Michael Vick and Charles Woodson and Brady just kind of slides in and I'm like, all right.
*  And he pulls me aside and he's like, he's like, what's up, man?
*  He's like, you know, I'm excited to work with you.
*  And we've done production meetings with him.
*  I've covered him.
*  I don't have a relationship with him.
*  You know, I know who he is.
*  He's really cool.
*  And then he's like, where can I get some cocaine around here?
*  Oh, I'm not the guy.
*  I'm not the guy.
*  I'm kidding.
*  Tell me your best Tampa Bay Bucks for a saint story and maybe I'll find you some.
*  And then Brady starts kind of like locking into me and going in on like he's like, you cover the game every day on Good Morning Football.
*  He's like, what do you think about the current way that like the quarterbacks are sort of protected and like locked in?
*  And he's like, I just think when I and you've seen the clips where he talks about this.
*  It was it was on me to not get those receivers injured.
*  And like I would have to eat it sometimes and take a sack.
*  And I would sometimes have to throw the ball away.
*  And he's like, and I wouldn't run out of the pocket because I get my head taken off by Ed Reader, Ray Lewis.
*  And he's like, he's like, really passionate and dialed in and locked in.
*  And I'm like, oh, shit.
*  Like he's talking about.
*  I watched film on Lamar.
*  He's like Lamar's amazing.
*  But, you know, if you notice like this, this was different back when I played.
*  So the question is, is he going to be critical?
*  I think he's going to be so passionate and like has real thoughts that in real time, I think it's going to be refreshing.
*  And I don't think we've seen that from one of these guys yet.
*  I don't know how it's going to go this weekend, but like I think that's even more fascinating than the game itself.
*  Cowboys vs. Browns.
*  Like, I want to hear Brady in between plays and Burkhart's been working with them and Richie Zients and Rich Russo, who are the producer and director.
*  And they're like, he wants to do the work like he's watching film like, I'm like, I don't know if that's what's the most necessary part, but like he's at least colored in as prepared as anybody.
*  So the roast made me think he might be pretty good at it because I was really surprised he did it and he really threw himself into it.
*  But, you know, one of the things I heard was that because he's because he's got that Raiders thing, he's not allowed to go to the pregame meetings.
*  And I'm like, he's like, well, he's not going to be able to do the meetings.
*  That's going to hurt him.
*  It's like those meetings are fucking stupid.
*  I get a lot of the meetings because it's me and I go in there and I'm like, oh, it's a chance for my face time.
*  Yeah, but half the stuff you're hearing is, we love this guy.
*  We're super excited about him.
*  We love this guy.
*  We love that guy.
*  And then these meetings are horseshit.
*  I've been in a million.
*  Here's how they go because not everyone at home knows.
*  Come in.
*  You hand the coach the all 22 or the depth chart, the flip cart, and some coaches will be like, all right, this guy's not playing.
*  He's injured and that's not public yet.
*  You'll find that out Sunday.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. Tell us because we have to prepare.
*  But somebody can find that out for Brady.
*  Sure. Exactly.
*  And then the analyst, which would be Brady or my crew, I used to work with Chris Spellman, who was really good at these.
*  And then John Lynch, I worked with as well.
*  And the analyst will usually lead those meetings and ask questions to the quarterback, the head coach and a defensive player.
*  And, you know, the sideline reporter gets one or two questions and the play by play guy usually will get one or two as well.
*  But it's usually led by the analyst.
*  In that crew, you've got Tom and Aldi, who's a great interviewer.
*  You've got Aaron Andrews.
*  You've got Kevin Burkhart.
*  You've got three different people who are all fantastic at what they do.
*  I think if Brady doesn't have a face to face with the Sean Watson, but those guys get whatever information they need to go into it.
*  He's done the work.
*  I almost don't necessarily need him in the meeting talking to Sean Watson.
*  What I want to be a lot of that stuff is filler like, well, as we talked to him yesterday, he told us that, you know, he's really I would.
*  How about this?
*  I'd rather not talk to anybody.
*  Yeah. Just show up for the game and broadcast it and be objective.
*  I did a couple of NBA games when I was at ESPN.
*  I remember one time we had a Lakers game and they weren't very good.
*  And we talked to Dan Tony.
*  He was the Laker coach.
*  And what was I never done an NBA one?
*  Is it you're in person or I actually really enjoyed it.
*  They're amazing.
*  They were.
*  They're so they're so candid because they want to win you over.
*  But it's all stuff you can't really use where he's like, ah, this fucking guy.
*  You know, like, all right, I can't use that.
*  I don't know.
*  It was fun to talk to him, but it didn't really color how I announced the game.
*  No.
*  But if you get a story, so like I told you that DJ Reed story about, you know, he's saying that Roger's like, that's a cool story.
*  I don't get that if I don't have that production meeting.
*  But it's I think where you really get it, because I'm convinced this happens with Roma where they tip them off like first quarter.
*  Well, you also wait.
*  What?
*  Just watch out for a trick play because we think that's also usually red zone and special teams and you get to go to practice.
*  If you're not doing it virtually, you get to go to practice.
*  I don't know if everyone's going to the practice those years, but like it might have all changed during covid.
*  But it used to be you get to go to practice.
*  You see what they're doing in the red zone.
*  And then that actually usually happen in the actual game.
*  So you're actually getting practice.
*  I guess so.
*  I I'm going to I'm going to adjust my take.
*  Yeah, I'm sure it's worth it.
*  But as a viewer, I'm always annoyed when they do that.
*  We talked to him last night.
*  We talked to him yesterday.
*  We talked to him on Friday.
*  It's like just fucking give me the info.
*  I don't I don't care.
*  I'm not taking notes.
*  It's like when the people report so and so sign an extension, his agent at so and so agency did the extension.
*  I'm like, I don't fucking care.
*  Who did the extension?
*  Yeah, I barely care that there was an extension.
*  Yeah.
*  And I was going to find out there's an extension tomorrow at nine anyway.
*  Oh, who like is there a quiz where I guess what agents that's it.
*  What did you say?
*  But back to Brady, though, I was going to say one more thing about I think he's going to be good.
*  I do.
*  I actually really do think he's going to be good.
*  He was super like locked in with that conversation.
*  And then the NFL comes to this thing as well because they have to go through the rules.
*  And one of the NFL executives was there and was talking about the dynamic kickoff.
*  And Brady was like, oh, oh, so like I've got thoughts on that, too.
*  And like he had like 20 minutes like with this NFL executive and it was all great.
*  It's all about football.
*  But like passionate.
*  And I don't know.
*  I'm seeing social media and Brady's at the Michael Rubin stuff and he's doing the he's doing the boat racing.
*  And I'm like, is he?
*  No, this dude is dialed in.
*  So at the very least, you're getting commitment.
*  And I think he's going to be great.
*  I have more of a question of if he's going to last the year.
*  As in like, does he want to do it?
*  No.
*  I'm just never convinced that that guy's done playing.
*  Fascinating.
*  Turn the fucking Tic Tac.
*  Turn the Tic Tac.
*  47 years old.
*  Turn it on.
*  Let's go.
*  We're in person.
*  Turn the Tic Tac camera on.
*  I think.
*  It's 47, dude.
*  I don't care.
*  I don't care.
*  I think he's still in shape.
*  I think he's always ready to go.
*  And if anything happened to one of the quarterbacks in the top six teams, I'm just.
*  I refuse to believe he's retired.
*  This is my point.
*  Fascinating take.
*  I think he's done.
*  I don't.
*  It's not a take.
*  So.
*  Like, I'm not putting a team out there.
*  No, no, I don't want to put bad jujube.
*  I'm just saying if it's a team that has a chance to win the Super Bowl and there's a
*  heaven-can-wait situation where something happens, I think he would come back.
*  Based on knowledge or just your gut here?
*  I'm just saying I think he would come back.
*  If you're that team.
*  I think up until he turns 50 years old, I will always believe there's a chance he will
*  come back because I think these guys are all wired the same way.
*  Boxers, you know, actors, rappers, these dudes that have really had like achieved great
*  stuff.
*  Once that switch gets turned off, the only way you stop doing is if your body's not cooperating
*  anymore.
*  I feel like you literally can't do it.
*  He looks great, dude.
*  He's in shape.
*  He looks great because he got super skinny there for a little bit, but he's not super
*  skinny anymore.
*  I was with him about a month ago.
*  He looked fantastic.
*  Yeah.
*  So anyway, I never believe that guys are done unless their body definitively tells them
*  they're done.
*  And you can't tell me if you put like two glasses of maybe JÃ¤germeister infused almond
*  milk or whatever the fuck he's able to drink.
*  You can't tell me like, Hey, Tom, do you think you could be one of the seven best QBs right
*  now without a training camp?
*  I guarantee he thinks he could.
*  All right.
*  Here's my counter.
*  If I'm too much of a TV Fox guy, whatever I'm employed by the Super Bowl year, he's
*  calling the Super Bowl.
*  Does he bail on that?
*  Oh, I thought you were going to say, can he call the Super Bowl but play for one of the
*  two teams trying to figure out?
*  No, I guess he would have to have the headphones on the sidelines.
*  I've said like, I guess even if he's, I don't know, if he's eliminated, he could probably
*  go back up.
*  The odds of a QB on a top five team getting hurt in like November, December, but it does
*  happen.
*  It happens.
*  I'm just saying for the rest of the 2020s until he hits 50, I'm not counting on him
*  coming back.
*  It's not a take.
*  I genuinely believe this.
*  It's not crazy.
*  I don't think these guys can shut it off.
*  I think Jordan would have kept playing if his knees didn't just, like his knees like
*  died on him.
*  He just couldn't play at the same level.
*  But he had all last year to come back and he had all this off season to come back and
*  he didn't come back.
*  Why would he do it now?
*  He's watching football, he's in the flow.
*  It's Sunday's routine.
*  My thought was, and this was last year, but now I'm convinced that he's all in and everything.
*  My thought was.
*  I'm not saying he's done all in.
*  No, no, no.
*  I was saying my thought last year was.
*  My point is a team is nine in one and their QB got hurt and he's staring at it and they
*  call him.
*  I know that he was ready to come back for that Niners last year.
*  That was a true story.
*  I'm not denying that.
*  I am 100% positive that that happened.
*  And that was less than a year ago that he was like, hey, Shannon, if anything happens
*  to Brock Purdy, I'm right here.
*  That was nine months ago.
*  He would come back if it was the right team.
*  Yeah, I'm not counting him out.
*  By the way, Peyton Manning would play again if his fucking network networked.
*  I also think these guys only retire when something's wrong.
*  I think Peyton actually plays a role in this.
*  I think Brady's the most competitive motherfucker there is.
*  And the fact that Peyton for the last three years is winning Emmys and his Harold is the
*  greatest thing to happen to sports media.
*  I think Brady wants to be the best at that too.
*  I think there's still a fire there also.
*  Like, all right, I got the number one job at Fox and call him the Super Bowl.
*  Let me show you what I can do now.
*  I kind of like that storyline of like, all right, here's a 10 minute clip of the Omaha
*  musical.
*  OK, that's Peyton.
*  I'm calling the Super Bowl, dude.
*  And I wonder if there's a competitive fire between the two of them there.
*  Look, he has it.
*  He had it really good.
*  He could just chill in Bakers Bay, Bahamas and play on the beach and he doesn't need
*  to be in Cleveland week one.
*  He certainly doesn't need to be doing Green Bay, Chicago week 11.
*  It was a seven game run.
*  You say get out of the booth and get suited.
*  Can you imagine?
*  Could you imagine?
*  And pick a team?
*  I don't know.
*  It's fun.
*  It's a great.
*  I'll say this out of all the great players that have retired.
*  And this happened, I guess there was like there was talk about John Havlicek in the
*  Celtics.
*  He retired after his 16th year in 1978.
*  How old was he?
*  And he was I think like 36, 37.
*  But everyone was like he was in amazing shape and he would play with the team every while
*  for the next couple of years.
*  And there was when the team got really good again, they were kind of like, yo, Hondo,
*  could you at 41?
*  Could you?
*  And and he easily just could have come back and kept playing.
*  But he was like, no, I retired.
*  And, you know, it's a different era.
*  There was way less money at stake.
*  Well, dude, I look at T.O. T.O. is 50 something right now.
*  But like we have him on the show.
*  He's incredible.
*  He's like, I want to still play.
*  Tyson, Tyson, same thing.
*  Got to fight.
*  Fighting.
*  Yeah.
*  That happened yet.
*  When is that?
*  I think that got that got pushed back again.
*  But like T.O. comes on Good Morning Football is 50 something years old and he's in the
*  most amazing shape and he's like, I still want to play.
*  And everyone makes a headline every time.
*  He's like, I can still run a four or five.
*  I think when you hit a certain point of greatness, you never think you're done.
*  You never think you're done unless your body like you, you know, it's like I was one of
*  the great blue guy pick up basketball players, you know, in the L.A. area.
*  And it's just my body wouldn't cooperate anymore.
*  And I knew it.
*  And you just when your body gives out, I don't think Brady's body is giving out.
*  He was to the bitter end.
*  Really good.
*  So anyway, I don't know.
*  It's a good topic.
*  I think if we're going for what would make this like the greatest season ever and it's
*  like somehow Brady ends up on an NFC team with seven weeks to go playing Mahomes going
*  for a three pete.
*  That'd be insane.
*  And then the world.
*  But I feel like an asteroid would just end after that.
*  Well, the world might end in November.
*  And I don't know either way.
*  But like that's how that's going to.
*  So are you like so because this this happens like with the Chiefs.
*  You're like kind of an honorary chiefs like you're kind of in.
*  You're like a doctor in the crew.
*  You went to Casey for comedy stuff.
*  Yes. And they I do this big slick event with them.
*  And I we auctioned off an incredible chief experience.
*  But you're not from Kansas City.
*  I'm not a new with it.
*  I've nothing to do. I was early on my home's.
*  Yeah.
*  Casey fans love that I picked them early to win their first.
*  We will. And they did it after the Mahomes second season, whatever it was.
*  And then, you know, Paul Rudd's a Brooklyn guy.
*  We became friendly. And then he's like, why don't you come to this event?
*  So now I'm at this this Kansas and my Kansas City royalty, because I pick them to win
*  and they win. And I'm like so bullish about it.
*  So last year, they were the five seed and I like a ton of arrogance.
*  And I was on your podcast doing the same thing.
*  And I'm like, they're not losing to the Bills.
*  I don't care if they're on the road like they're going to beat the Bills.
*  And they did. They're not losing to the Ravens.
*  And they barely beat the Bills.
*  Kansas City like, of course, they win.
*  Kansas City fans and I we've we've we've hit it off.
*  But it's interesting, the chief is an organization.
*  Like I did this whole thing today, predicting them to win.
*  I called it a chief's Pete on a three peter is great, blah, blah, blah.
*  Everyone's tweeting it. Chiefs organization like.
*  They're not that way, like they wouldn't repost that.
*  They wouldn't celebrate. They wouldn't be like a thumbs up shrug.
*  Like, that's not their thing.
*  That goes to Clark Hunt, that goes to his father, Lamar.
*  It's like they are their social media presence as creative as their content.
*  People are it's like they are not boastful.
*  They are not that way.
*  And it's almost like we're just going to take care of our stuff.
*  And the the win that I talked to Andy and Spags about this the year afterwards,
*  the win that they were so proud of their team.
*  And Ted Cruz was the old PR guy, not the Texas senator is PR guys now with the bears.
*  Stories come in somewhere, I promise.
*  They they had the Cincinnati Bengals game the year after they lost to the Bengals.
*  And it was Borough head and then the mayor of Cincinnati came out.
*  And it was like talking and no one said anything from Casey.
*  And then Casey wins in the locker room afterwards.
*  They were so fired up because they wanted to talk so bad and they just didn't.
*  And like the team was so proud.
*  The organization was probably not a single thing publicly.
*  My home's it. They were they hated that Bengals team.
*  And they hated the fact that the Bengals were puffing their chest
*  and thought they were going to go in.
*  And that's very patriot's.
*  It was Mike Hilton, who's not Joe Burrow or Jamar Chase,
*  but was Mike Hilton running his mouth and like not a single chiefs player.
*  The past as it went on with the Pats, they started getting a little more feisty about that,
*  because I remember who was the Steelers?
*  Was it Ryan Clark?
*  Who was the Steelers D back?
*  No, it wasn't Ryan Clark. It was somebody.
*  Let's think I'll get it.
*  Is the Steelers D back who talked shit about Brady?
*  Really? And then Brady just targeted him and torched him.
*  Was it in that and talked to all kinds of shit in one of the playoff games?
*  Yeah, shit.
*  20 years of Pat's history is when they gathered this one with somebody.
*  But they just they were like, and then Brady ran up to him.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Brady really like when we got to 2010, he loved that shit.
*  Brady loved that. And that was his motivation.
*  It's like someone else is picking against us.
*  And, you know, one thing with Mahomes, he sees and reads it all.
*  I know that he sees and reads it all.
*  And the NFL Network does his top 100 list that is like, oh, Tyreek being one.
*  Tyreek one.
*  Lamar being ready to have him.
*  He was number four on the list.
*  Was that the players did that?
*  Yes, the players vote on it.
*  But that's the thing. Like we players shouldn't vote on anything.
*  You can't be mad.
*  It was voted in November.
*  Or December of last year, and Tyreek was voted number one in Mahomes, number four.
*  Remember, they were the five seed in the AFC.
*  But trust me, when Mahomes was ranked third and Lamar was ranked one,
*  like that fired him up.
*  And I know for a fact that Mahomes sees that he's number four on the NFL 100.
*  Player voting is they did this in the NBA.
*  That's how the MVP used to be decided.
*  And it was a disaster.
*  Like in the 50s and 60s.
*  George is a disaster.
*  And they finally were like, we got to fix this.
*  It's like you just got agendas.
*  You got people voting against somebody who's a rival against their teammate.
*  Having enough ex players who have done it, they're like, you know,
*  the people come in with the list.
*  It's after practice. It's November.
*  It's like, I just did it.
*  And like we hold it like as if it's like the most sacred.
*  Or they might not even know what the list is.
*  They might think it's for like MVP for that year.
*  That list though, had if you have a list with Lamar over Mahomes,
*  Lamar over Mahomes.
*  You almost have to set the list on fire.
*  Yeah. And Lamar is really good.
*  Lamar's MVP. But come on.
*  I know. And that's what I say.
*  And like Mahomes is up here and we go here and then we got the rest of the quarterbacks.
*  Because defensive coordinators can't sleep at night and he says, unbelievable.
*  Fine. We put another quarterback over Mahomes.
*  He sees that.
*  Tyreek can't be one when his team traded him and then immediately won the next two Super Bowls.
*  Yeah. And I'm a Tyreek fan as well.
*  All right. This was fun.
*  We'll have to keep doing this during the season.
*  In summary, Seattle, we both like.
*  Denver, you kind of like.
*  I'm sort of in just because of Jets.
*  Jets in Seattle seem to be and Jacksonville and Jacksonville.
*  And then we're a little worried about San Francisco.
*  I'm more worried about Cincy than most.
*  Oh, Cincy. I didn't have them in the playoffs either.
*  I just. What about Dallas?
*  Where did you come out on? Oh, I'm out. Thumbs down.
*  What about Sal?
*  Well, Sal is not a reliable narrator.
*  And you don't want to go to.
*  Is he like excited about it? He's high every year.
*  You can't you can't take.
*  All right. You can't take his Dallas.
*  Belichick and Brady as media mavens.
*  We'll see.
*  We'll know with Belichick after week one.
*  After if he if he's.
*  You want Kirk Cousins to throw a pick and Belichick to come on inside the NFL and be.
*  I want to totally miss the coverage.
*  I want him to be like, here's how the Steelers defense destroyed Kirk Cousins in week one.
*  Here are the three things they did.
*  And now here's what Atlanta has to do, because the Steelers did this, this and this.
*  All the work.
*  So Atlanta now has to do this, this and this.
*  If he does that, he'll be great.
*  Am I making a crazy stretch?
*  I just I mean, I pulled it out of my ass earlier.
*  This I've really thought of it here and I think it's good now.
*  Brady might be inspired to be to be better than Peyton Manning at broadcasting.
*  Is that a crazy take?
*  That's me. That's trying, man.
*  You know, I think 10 years ago, I would have been more into it.
*  I just feel like Brady won.
*  Yeah, it's like he just.
*  Manning's really good, though.
*  Manning's Manning's been awesome with the media side.
*  I'm just saying like the Brady versus Manning thing kind of is done now.
*  Yeah. You don't think he's watching the Manning cast every Monday night and like Peyton's.
*  He's really good at this. I could be good to him.
*  I don't. I think Fox offered him a lot of money and really went after him and wanted him to do it.
*  And that's fair.
*  You know, he'll do it for a couple of years and then he'll own the Raiders or be part owner.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  Whatever that is, I don't know how that's going to figure itself out.
*  But the NFL obviously wouldn't love him to own a team and also be in production meetings.
