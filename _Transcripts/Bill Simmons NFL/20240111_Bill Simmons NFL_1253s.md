# Belichick Leaves the Patriots: Whatâ€™s Next? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [January 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ4erMbtz-0)
*  It's not every week that Bill Belichick and Nick Saban, um,
*  leave their jobs within 24 hours and you worked with both,
*  but the Belichick thing, we knew this was coming.
*  I actually liked that it wasn't like dragged out and let's try to see if we
*  can get a pick and she's like, man, you were here 24 years, go,
*  if you want to keep coaching, go somewhere else.
*  Anything surprise you about how all this played out?
*  No, I think, I think the best thing about it was that both had the vision of
*  what do we want to be like in five years?
*  Like, where are we going to be?
*  Like, we don't want this to be an ugly divorce where, you know,
*  we can't figure out where the kids want to go to college and how we're going.
*  You know, like, let's just be mature and appreciate that five years from now,
*  you'll be back here.
*  I'll be here and we can honor you correctly.
*  And I think that was the intent of it.
*  And I think it came out genuinely that way.
*  How does the Belichick thing evolve?
*  Cause you've watched this happen a few times with football.
*  Like we saw Joe Gibbs go back to Washington and it didn't go well the second
*  time, but now as the years pass, everyone's like, Joe Gibbs, one of the greatest
*  coaches, the belt.
*  I personally think the last four years will kind of kind of fade away with the
*  Belichick era and we'll concentrate on the whole Brady run.
*  But at the same time, I do feel like, I do feel like legacy standpoint,
*  if he does take over a good team and he does have a little more success and
*  maybe wins that one last Superbowl, I think that last Superbowl helped Brady in
*  a weird way with Tampa.
*  It separated.
*  He did something that wasn't tied with Belichick.
*  And do you think that drives Belichick at this point or does he not care?
*  I think he cares about performance.
*  He loves process, but I think he cares about performance.
*  And I think to me, I wrote this in my book, you know, there's, there is a
*  section of, and it's not going to apply to Bill, but there's that my second stint
*  is killing my first stint problem with coaches, right?
*  Hank Strand goes from Kansas City.
*  Let's matriculate the ball down the field.
*  He goes to New Orleans with the disaster.
*  George Seifert goes from San Francisco to Carolina, disaster, right?
*  Mike Shanahan goes from Denver to Washington, not a disaster, but not very good.
*  Right?
*  So that second stint, and I think it becomes harder the second time,
*  especially if you try to repeat what you did the first time.
*  And I think what you see with Belichick, whether it's the Brady offense in 2000
*  for the one for the first Superbowl to when they wanted a night and then last one,
*  things evolve and have changed over time.
*  And what won't change though, Bill, what won't change.
*  And I think people misread this is how to build a team is never going to change.
*  You need accountability.
*  You need, you need coaches that will develop talent.
*  You need to be on the cutting edge of motivating the players.
*  So I don't think that's going to get old.
*  I don't really do.
*  I think you and I were the only two people on the planet who thought the
*  Patriots actually could have been like 10 and seven or 11 and six with real
*  quarterback.
*  Their defense was legitimately good.
*  They never gave up explosive plays.
*  They lost you down in Gonzalez.
*  Like part of me wonders, I still think he can have a good defense.
*  And if you give him pieces, you know, it's just the question of who's running the
*  offense and then who's the quarterback.
*  He had the worst quarterbacks in the league.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, let's say this just hypothetically, let's say if he, if this team had Dante
*  coach in the lie, had Josh as the offensive coordinator, what would it have
*  looked like?
*  Yeah, I think it looks a little different.
*  I think we don't put enough into that.
*  Right.
*  And I'm not blaming, you know, anybody, Bill O'Brien or Adrian Clem, but I think
*  there was, you know, in any sport, there's always a production and design problem.
*  Right.
*  The production problem is, you know, the coach feels that's the players.
*  Do we have enough players?
*  The design problem, are we using the players well?
*  Right.
*  Atlanta Falcons, for example, they think they have a great, a lot of great players,
*  but it's the production that's killing, holding them back.
*  Whether that's true or not, I don't know.
*  But like New England, I think part of their issue was both.
*  They had a production problem.
*  They didn't get a backup quarterback.
*  I mean, they, Bailey Zappi this summer was a disaster and they didn't answer that.
*  And even though everybody knew Mack wasn't playing well by week three of the season,
*  Mack was killing them.
*  They had nobody to turn to.
*  Now that's the fault of the, that's the production issue.
*  Right.
*  And so it's hard to evaluate the design when you can't get the
*  quarterback to make a play.
*  So I think it's a little bit of both in certain cases.
*  Wait, wait, hold on.
*  Don't, don't forget about the worst kicker in the league who you draft them
*  the first round or across them three games.
*  At least.
*  And how many more, you know, how many more, I mean, not only do they love
*  giving the ball away offensively, they love missing field goals, which are
*  turnovers too, right?
*  So yeah, you know, so that, I think if they would have had a little different setup,
*  but the design of the team by the staff, which I think everybody plays a part in.
*  And I think that's what we saw today.
*  I don't think this was a divorce of it's your fault.
*  It's your fault.
*  It's your fault.
*  I think there was a collaboration of fault, if you will.
*  Yeah.
*  And sometimes it's, it's time to go.
*  And I just wonder like, you know, they have this third pick coming.
*  If he wanted to rebuild from the bottom and do it in New England, you could
*  argue, all right, what if, what if Jade and Daniels is awesome?
*  And with the defense and Junon goods always come back and use some other
*  picks, you could be good right away.
*  And then I see some of the jobs open.
*  It's like Atlanta and Washington and Carolina doesn't even have a
*  pick and the Chargers who have no salary cap room.
*  It's not a better situation than he was already in with the Patriots.
*  And it makes me think it's he in that Parcells mode of in the
*  2000s when Parcells took the Dallas job.
*  And it's like, why are you taking this job?
*  I'm taking it for money.
*  And because I have a chance to actually win the super bowl.
*  I didn't think this initially, but now I'm thinking like, does he, is he just
*  kind of wait to see what super bowl roster he could inherit and we'll know
*  after round one, round two, somebody from round one and round two, who seems
*  like they're in a good spot might not be in two weeks.
*  Here's what I think we're really, everybody's making a huge mistake on.
*  I think to me, everybody looks at this very linear, what jobs are open.
*  And there's another lane to that.
*  Right.
*  What jobs could be open next year.
*  Okay.
*  Cause that's the lane that should be really interested.
*  Are you saying a year from now?
*  The year from now, if your coach is potential, if you're sitting, if you're
*  an owner or a general manager and you're sitting in the room, say the guy's going
*  to have to win next year and he's gone.
*  And Bell, to me, I know we're talking Belichick, but I've never seen it.
*  Maybe you have in basketball.
*  I haven't seen it in football where this is a generational opportunity.
*  You've got, you know, Steve Kerr and the warriors, when he took over that 14,
*  15 words, I think that's one of the only times I can remember somebody walking
*  into a, a ready-built championship situation, but if look at it from the other
*  side, how many times have you seen this many great coaches available in a free
*  market industry, right?
*  You can hire Harbaugh.
*  You could hire.
*  Vrabel.
*  You could hire Belichick and Pete Carroll.
*  If he wants to coach and you could hire Pete, he wants to coach.
*  So you've got four guys that have above a 58% winning percentage that you could hire.
*  Harbaugh 71% in the NFL.
*  You know, I don't know if Vrabel's at 50 over that, but he's close.
*  And the last two years heard him Belichick and Pete.
*  You're not including Frank Reich, right?
*  He's not including Frank, right?
*  Okay.
*  So I want to make sure.
*  You're right.
*  So now you have a chance to do that.
*  So really to me, I call this a generational opportunity because, you
*  know, Kennedy used to say this all the time.
*  He said the Chinese have two brushstrokes for the word crisis.
*  One brushstroke stands for danger.
*  The other stands for opportunity to me, what looks like a crisis for some teams
*  today could be a great opportunity because you're never going to have this
*  many great coaches available.
*  So if now I know this makes no sense at all because they're tremendous.
*  But if you're the Jets owner and you have Robert Sala, who you've watched
*  coach for 15 some games and he went seven and 10 though, I mean, come on Mike.
*  They didn't have a quarterback.
*  Unlike no other team was in a situation like them.
*  I know that.
*  So why would you make a change?
*  Yeah.
*  Why?
*  He's fine.
*  Why would you change that?
*  So, but to me, I think there's a great opportunity.
*  Like that's where we're missing the boat.
*  Like the job of any owner or any general manager is what can I do to improve my
*  team today?
*  And if I have to remember, now this is a great one, the great Leon Hess.
*  I don't know if the Hess oil was up in Boston when you were growing up, but he,
*  he started Hess oil.
*  He's a, was a billionaire, wonderful human being, wonderful human being.
*  But he had the same scenario.
*  He had the same situation.
*  He loved rich Coke type.
*  Don't ask me how, but he thought he was his son.
*  And so when he had the opportunity to hire rich coat type, when he got fired after
*  taking the seven and two Eagles out of the playoffs, okay.
*  He fired Pete Carroll to hire a rich coat type.
*  He was thinking the right way.
*  Wrong guy.
*  Wrong guy.
*  Right.
*  Never again.
*  But to league, we just think we're the openings.
*  I don't know where this is going to go because as the, no one's fully declared
*  themselves because these coaches have never been in the market before.
*  I mean, go through it.
*  If you were, if you're a team that's in the middle of the road and you know, like
*  just actually make the list the other way, John Harbaugh is not getting fired.
*  You wouldn't replace Sean McVay.
*  You wouldn't replace Kyle Shattuck, Andy Reed, D'Amico Ryan.
*  It's like, I wouldn't replace Kevin O'Connell because I think he's a good coach.
*  But if you're Green Bay, would you replace Matt LaFleur for a chance to get one of
*  these guys?
*  Right.
*  I mean.
*  Well, what about Buffalo?
*  What happens if Buffalo looks like shit in the Pittsburgh game and then loses in
*  round two and it's like, we have Josh Allen.
*  How many more years are we going to waste her?
*  Yeah.
*  Like I, I'm not trying to get anybody fired, but I think I'm trying to change the
*  mindset of the way people look at these openings when you have this many good
*  coaches out there, right?
*  When you have this many, there's no time it's ever going to happen again.
*  It's the, it's the, it's the solar eclipse of coaches.
*  That's a good way to put it.
*  Um, you know, and so you've got to take advantage of it.
*  There's great opportunity here.
*  Like if I'm Jacksonville, right.
*  And I underachieved as a team, cause don't tell me you have it.
*  I have a quarterback that's underachieving.
*  I got to pay him a hundred million dollars.
*  I got to pay him 200 million.
*  I can't not sign them.
*  If I'm Sha Khan, do I say, maybe I should go get Jim Harbaugh.
*  Maybe that takes care of all my problems.
*  Or do I say, I hope Dougie is going to be able to do it.
*  Well, meanwhile, you have a bunch of jobs open and none of them are totally appetizing.
*  They all come with either, you don't have a QB or you're on the first round pick or
*  you have salary, cap trouble, even a job like Vegas, they're already paying like
*  $80 million to all of these other coaches on top of like, they don't have a shitload
*  of talent.
*  Um, I think Atlanta is probably the most interesting job to me because I do think
*  they have talent on both sides of the ball and they're only missing the
*  quarterback piece.
*  And maybe you could get lucky with the quarterback, but the more interesting
*  teams to me are the teams that are still in it.
*  Like if Dallas flames out, what if the Packers beat Dallas?
*  What if Buffalo loses in the first two rounds?
*  Um, what if Philly loses to Baker Mayfield on Monday night?
*  Like there's, there's variables and we owe it.
*  We're always like, oh my God, I can't believe that guy got fired.
*  It happens every year.
*  Somebody gets fired every year coming out of the first two rounds.
*  And then if it's like a ready-made roster, it's like, oh, I'm going to be
*  ready-made roster and you have your choice of these plug and play dudes.
*  Harbaugh is younger, so he has a chance.
*  Like if he really wants to build something, you know, you go to Washington,
*  it's a second pick new owners.
*  This is now a six year.
*  I can, I can build up ramp, but Carol's in his seventies.
*  Belichick's going to be 73.
*  Like I can't imagine they want to build something for the next four or five
*  years, or am I wrong?
*  I think that, that what he would do is build an organization.
*  Like Arthur blank has always gone big game hunting.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, he tried to get Joe Gibbs.
*  He tried to get parcels many times and you know, and Belichick, see the beautiful
*  thing about hiring someone like Belichick or variable is they're going to lay an
*  infrastructure down for your team that will withstand forever.
*  See what we're about to learn is what was once the Cleveland way, which then
*  became the Patriot way, which then became the LSU Alabama way, Michigan
*  state way, and really confirmed into the Patriot way, we're going to find out if
*  it's the Belichick way or if it truly is the Patriot way, right?
*  We're going to find that out.
*  And the next team that gets bill will, we'll have that way.
*  And so that way, if it's done correctly and it's taught correctly, it has
*  sustainability, let's go back to parcels.
*  Jerry hires parcels for two reasons, which I thought were two reasons.
*  I think it ended up being one.
*  He gains parcels in because he needed credibility and he needed a stadium.
*  You bring parcels in, he built that stadium for Jerry, right?
*  And I thought he was, and I thought he was going to help.
*  But I probably think he did.
*  I bet you Steven Jones would say being around parcels for three or three years,
*  really taught him a lot about the game.
*  And that helped them sustain success.
*  I think if you bring Belichick and they're going to have this sustainable
*  infrastructure, that if you're smart, you can let it run, you can let it continue
*  to go and it's a plug and play thing.
*  If you get the right guy there.
*  Is it fair to say variables, the number one draft pick because of his age and the
*  fact that he's had real success already, but he's maybe not even the coach that
*  he's going to be four years from now.
*  If you're, if you're a team that really wants to build something for the next
*  20 years, I mean, variable could, variable could his next job, he could still be
*  there in 2040.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I think it's, I think hardball is a hot commodity because 71% winning
*  percentage.
*  Yeah.
*  What happened to variable is the same thing that happened to hardball.
*  Let's not forget this now.
*  Hardball is in San Francisco.
*  Okay.
*  And Trent Alcky is the general manager and they're having conflict between the
*  two, the universal conflict, the players are better than, you know, all that crap.
*  Right.
*  And so hardball just leaves and goes to Michigan.
*  The 49ers let that happen.
*  They were tired of hardball.
*  They were tired of all that crap.
*  They promote the great Jim Tomasula, which you probably made a lot of money
*  betting against them.
*  I love that.
*  So, right.
*  And then, then they had fired Tomasula after a year and hired Chip Kelly.
*  And then they fired Belki and they had to give him a Kyle Shanahan.
*  Tennessee is about to go through the same thing, right?
*  Because everybody thinks I can replace him.
*  Everybody thinks he's replacing him.
*  Amy Adams wants her team back.
*  Yeah.
*  She's excited to run her own organization now.
*  She doesn't need Mike Frabel.
*  She's got Rand Carthon.
*  I mean, it's like, we're going to go out to the field and we're just going to start
*  pulling lettuce out.
*  Like, there's not a lot of good coaches.
*  Like, right?
*  Like what?
*  There's not a lot of good coaches.
*  Are there good coaches that want to coach Will Levis?
*  Well, she in the press release, she announced him as the good player.
*  Like you talking about a delusional press release.
*  You talk about somebody who's, I mean, you walk in there.
*  I got to make him a player.
*  No.
*  So I think with Braybo, what he proved is Braybo is going to get better.
*  Harbaugh is going to get, but they both have to be in the right situation.
*  If you go back and read the education of a coach by Halberstam on Bill, there's a
*  quote in there that Halberstam writes that when Belichick left Cleveland, any job
*  he was going to take, which is why that famous press conference occurred.
*  I won't be the NY, I won't be the HC of the NYJ.
*  It's because he wanted to install his culture.
*  And everybody thinks like people are saying, well, you hire Belichick.
*  You can't let him do personnel because you can't let him run everything.
*  Well, you got to let him run the culture.
*  Like you got to let the coach run the culture.
*  And if the general manager and the coach aren't on the same page, you don't have a
*  culture, you don't have, what you have was what you hear when you were growing up.
*  What did you hear about the Patriots with Dick Steinberg?
*  Great team, great athlete that couldn't win shit.
*  Right.
*  Well, that's because Steinberg was bigger than the program and the
*  coach could never set the culture.
*  And so that's the problem.
*  The next job, Ravel takes the next job Belichick takes the next job Harbaugh takes.
*  The owner is going to have to say, you run the culture.
*  And like Washington doesn't appear that way.
*  Washington's got more people involved in the interview process than, than anybody.
*  I mean, they, you know, they could run, they have the Merv Griffin show, the Mike
*  Doug, they got a bunch of people doing interviews.
*  If they hit, they have it in Hollywood squares.
*  It's nine squares and three rows.
*  And the coach comes in and he just talks to the nine people.
*  I mean, like, I never see anything like it.
*  Like, like who, like when you have that many people, you're interviewing that
*  many people involved, doesn't the owner, isn't he supposed to say, this is what
*  my team looks, this is what I want my team to be.
*  If you're Arthur blank and you call Bill on the phone and you say, Bill, I want
*  you to build a sustainable organization that is built on the check.
*  Right.
*  Here's, here's a hundred million dollars for six years, please.
*  Or $130 million for six years.
*  Please build me a sustainable something.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, cause look, the money's not an issue anymore.
*  These owners are, they're making so much money with the cab and
*  everything, so the players.
*  So Saban had a quote that I thought really jumped out to me and it's something that
*  confirmed some of my, some of my Belichick feelings his last 10 years.
*  When he said, did you read the quote where he said, I'm going to, I'm paraphrasing,
*  but it was something like at age 72, I can still do the 14 hour work days, but I
*  can't stay on top of everything the same way I could when I was age 62.
*  Like he, he's basically admitted like, I can still put it in the work.
*  I'm just, I don't feel like I'm at the same level of detail and you know, I'm
*  getting older, you're getting older.
*  You can see it.
*  Um, is it realistic to think people can coach NFL teams as they hit their mid
*  seventies, like really like Marv Levy was the only one I think who stayed on that
*  lay Vermeer maybe got all, but for the most part, it's like really unusual.
*  I think the band, he has to have the right band with them.
*  Like I think Nick, Nick went through a lot of coaches, you know, and, and I
*  think what we saw at the end of Bill's reign was he lost a lot of the people
*  that he needed around them.
*  Yeah.
*  I think those, you know, like the thing is, is most people in Tennessee, I
*  think most people in new England are really not going to know everything
*  that bill did until he's gone because there's so much shit he took care of
*  that Tennessee that you just, you took for granted.
*  And I think when you start to lose allies within the building, you know, and
*  you know, he thought that he could do it with some of the guys that they brought
*  in, it didn't work and they have to take responsibility for it.
*  But I think that's, I think they can still do the job.
*  I just think they need more people around them that understand who they are.
*  So you're saying it was like, like Michael Corleone, Godfather two, when
*  he's down to like Al and Connie.
*  And that's like his brain trust all of a sudden, cause he's even pushed out Tom.
*  It's like Tom, you're out.
*  And there's nobody around that he can rely on that he can trust.
*  Remember?
*  And it's a great analogy.
*  Remember when he gets shot, the only person he really can trust is Hagen.
*  So he calls them in there.
*  And at this moment I'm making you the Don cause you're the only one I can
*  completely trust.
*  Well, when you start losing those loyal people, you know, and you that don't
*  understand really the essence of the program, then you lose a little bit of
*  the details.
*  That's why the band kind of that's why the East street band still makes great
*  music.
*  They all stayed together.
*  That's why the Rolling Stone, you know, it's like, you got to stay together.
*  I'm sure they wouldn't be the same if they had to start changing all these
*  parts.
*  Yeah.
