# Was theÂ 2021 QB Class a Miss? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [October 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNHyp3NezKA)
*  2021 QB class.
*  When do we start getting worried?
*  I didn't even prep you for this.
*  I'm just throwing it at you.
*  Lawrence, his win-loss record is now four and 18.
*  Great.
*  TD interception 17-17 for his career.
*  And since his really nice week too, it seems like he's going backwards.
*  You had Zach Wilson of the, uh, Superbowl favorite New York Jets who somehow
*  10 TDs, 13 picks for his career.
*  And the Jets fans are terrified every time it's like third and eight.
*  Trey Lance is hurt fields.
*  I just don't know if he's a starting quarterback.
*  He's 11 TDs, 15 picks for his career.
*  You have Trask and Mond and Book and Ellinger.
*  No idea what happens with them.
*  And the best two QB so far, just statistically have been Davis
*  Mills and Mack Jones, who is currently in a QB battle with Bradley Zappi,
*  who nobody knew who that was four weeks ago.
*  Um, did we miss on this class?
*  What are you worried about?
*  I think, I think we certainly missed a little bit.
*  One of the main things about Lawrence coming out was that there was this kind
*  of golden child next to Andrew Luck title that was dropped on him, and then he
*  watched the Clemson offense that they ran there and it's like bubble screens,
*  RPOs, it's, it's not, it wasn't grown up.
*  Right.
*  And so a big part of Lawrence's transition was from a tools perspective,
*  from an intangibles perspective, mentality perspective, and then the way he throws
*  the ball and how it arrives, yeah, it's all there, but like, he's going to have
*  to grow up into an NFL offense.
*  He's going to have to transition more so than guys like Zach Wilson and Justin
*  Fields.
*  So that was not the narrative going in, but Wilson was like playing at least
*  like a Shanahan inspired offense, right?
*  Fields was throwing like common NFL concepts.
*  Lauren Lawrence was running a ton of college stuff and then his first coach
*  was urban Meyer and that just went so, so poorly, right?
*  So this class, I don't feel like we missed on it too much in terms of the
*  talent, but the, uh, the lessons we're going to learn about development are
*  going to be really big because you get Lawrence in that sort of a situation.
*  You get Fields in Chicago where like Fields looks not good, right?
*  Like I was a huge Justin Fields fan.
*  I hate the way he, yeah, I hate the way he looked at the back half last year.
*  I hate the way he looks through the first half this year.
*  Like the Vikings game had nice moments.
*  Washington game still had nice moments.
*  Like there's stuff you want to hang your hat on, but the totality of it is poor.
*  And then you look at what's been around him and you're like, could anybody have,
*  could I have dropped Johnny United in here and he would have developed, you
*  know what I mean?
*  Like the context just does not foster the development of the quarterback.
*  The line is breaking him.
*  He's getting David Card.
*  Like the, the, uh, charting services have checked like, Oh, the offensive
*  lines playing well, sure, but not really.
*  And also fields doesn't know how to behave behind an offensive line right now.
*  He'd never learned how, right?
*  And so you just have, you've so many stunted spots in development, Wilson
*  and Lance with the injuries that it feels more like a missed opportunity on this
*  class as opposed to like, we really missed on the talent.
*  Yeah.
*  With quarterbacks, especially the pedigree guys, it is crazy how they can just get
*  broken and we see it like in baseball.
*  It happens with baseball closers, right?
*  We had like going way back.
*  The Red Sox had Calvin Sheraldi who was throwing high nineties was like
*  everything big, tall, closer, durable.
*  And the 86 playoffs happened and he's just broken.
*  He's just never the same after that.
*  We've seen that over and over again.
*  You see it hockey goalies.
*  There'll be some goalie that has a bad playoff series or bad postseason and they
*  just crater and they're never the same quarterbacks.
*  Like cars, a good example.
*  I feel like it happened a little bit with Baker Mayfield because I think what
*  made him maybe physically he's, I don't know what kind of damage he's had, but
*  that dude carried himself with a lot of confidence and the guy in Carolina was
*  like a broken man and we've seen this over and over again with quarterbacks.
*  I don't know where I stand on the Lawrence thing.
*  I've lost money on the Jaguars three years in a row and three weeks in a row
*  and the Jags and, uh, and what was alarming to me just for the Lawrence future
*  thing is I didn't really trust him.
*  Yeah.
*  He, he seemed a little discombobulated.
*  I'm not sure about his choices.
*  I thought he was going to be so athletic moving around and just like, just putting
*  so much pressure on teams for, and it doesn't seem like that's really the case.
*  I don't think his skill guys are that bad.
*  ETN has been, I think really bad.
*  Like he's had big drops and bad moments for them for what you're expecting.
*  But for the most part, I don't see the golden child thing with him.
*  And it's like, how much longer does he have in your opinion where we should
*  start readjusting our expectations for him?
*  I'm certainly happy to give them the rest of this year because of the urban thing.
*  I like every time I talk about the Jackson Lawrence preseason, now I always end up
*  saying like, we are underestimating how much urban affected this team in the
*  development.
*  And even if it's like the only thing we talk about for the next 10 months, we're
*  probably still underestimating.
*  Like it was so detrimental to the culture of the team and to the development of the
*  young players that to me, it very much feels like a rookie season for Lawrence
*  in that regard, the improvements that they made in the skill position players
*  are to his benefit.
*  The improvement they made in the scheme is to his benefit.
*  And you see some of that in how he plays.
*  They do still need a little bit better speed because right now they, they throw a
*  lot 10 to 20 range and they really don't throw past the 20.
*  So they don't stretch the field as much as you like.
*  So they do need a little bit more speed, but that point you make about Lawrence
*  outside of the pocket, Lawrence mobility is so important because all we ever said
*  at Clemson was like, it'll surprise you.
*  This guy will beat you with his legs.
*  You don't realize how quick he is.
*  And then he gets to Jacksonville and for a year and a half, he's been a pocket
*  passer and it's like, it'll surprise you.
*  He'll get on top of you.
*  Don't know how quick he is.
*  He needs to be moved outside of the pocket a little bit more.
*  He needs to be more willing to run and extend and to tuck.
*  And critically, he has to learn risk management.
*  The number one issue with Lawrence right now is he spent all of his time at Clemson
*  never, never, never, never, never getting burned.
*  It never hurt.
*  Even when he made his mistakes, they just trotted out a defense of first rounders
*  and they just stopped whoever was opposing him, right?
*  Like say for like a national championship.
*  It really was never a bad Lawrence game.
*  He made mistakes that that handicapped that hamstrung the team.
*  So then you go to a second and goal one yard, two yards to gain against
*  Houston and there's no window, there's no throw, but he's never been burned before.
*  So he throws it.
*  He tries to jam into the window because he's never hurt.
*  Right.
*  And so now I think you start to experience that hurt.
*  You start to learn what NFL speed is like, how NFL teams can punish you off of one
*  mistake and you start to learn how to manage risk.
*  Managing risk is the number one thing a college quarterback has to learn in the
*  NFL, what's worth it and what isn't.
*  What, when is the juice worth the squeeze?
*  And for somebody like Lawrence, who just always had premier talent at Clemson, to
*  me, that's a learning process that should take his whole rookie year, which to me,
*  this functionally is his rookie year.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know what his comp is from what I've seen.
*  I'm trying to think of other successful quarterbacks I've seen, like with his
*  size, he does move like when he rolls out, it feels like something good is going to
*  happen and then half the time he makes a bad decision.
*  I I'm not sure.
*  Like if you had to, let's say one of these quarterbacks from this class is going to
*  win a Superbowl like Biff from back to the future is like, there's a 2021 guy
*  who's going to get a Superbowl.
*  Who would you pick at this point?
*  Like it's tempting to say Lance just cause we don't know anything.
*  So it could still be good.
*  You know, like you're just like, yeah, it's gonna be great.
*  The Lance thing worries me just because talk about development, man.
*  He's attempting.
*  Yeah.
*  You've lost two years in my lifetime.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like it's, it's, it's really scary.
*  He's obviously in such a great spot.
*  I think I would still guess Lawrence.
*  Lawrence more so feels like I wanted him to be more at this point, as opposed to
*  fields where it's like, I don't even know if you're recoverable.
*  I think field still is just because of the scramble value.
*  Like the big thing I've been on this year with Daniel Jones and with Jalen
*  Hertz is like, man, these quarterbacks who've been scrambled really just save
*  your offense and they just pick up the floor so much.
*  So I still have some hope for, for fields if you were in a different spot, but
*  that's not happening anytime soon.
*  I think Jacksonville is a good environment.
*  I think Doug knows how to develop guys.
*  I'd probably still take Lawrence.
*  With that said, I would need Biff from back to the future to tell me one of them
*  was winning it before I would go, yeah, seriously.
*  Yeah.
*  I, I get the Peterson thing, but I think the game management stuff they've done
*  has been really dumb, especially the last couple of weeks, like fourth and one
*  options and huge moments that swing momentum of games, stuff like that.
*  I, Eleanor is the interesting one to me because when you just laid out with Hertz
*  and Marriota and like the league is kind of moving at least a little bit with some
*  of the QBs to these mobile quarterbacks and that's, that's his calling card.
*  Right.
*  So, yeah, I'm at some point, somebody will roll the dice with that dude.
*  And I'll probably be in Indianapolis next year.
*  Yeah.
*  I would not mind at all.
*  Let's say like Indianapolis craters, which it's always funny because like
*  Indy's terrible, but they're three, two and one, so they're very fast right now.
*  But if they crater, I wouldn't mind seeing Eleanor play at all.
*  Just for that point, right.
*  A scrambled quarterback.
*  It's not that he creates better plays.
*  It's that he erases worst plays.
*  Nine yard sacks become three yard runs.
*  And that swing in terms of like expected points is enormous.
*  It's the biggest 12 yard swing you could ever get on a field.
*  It's turning a sack into like a, just like a moderate gain.
*  And so anytime you have a quarterback who can use his legs, his ability to
*  erase negative plays is really big to raising your floor.
*  And so, all right, get the guy out there and then see if he can become something
*  more and that's why the jets with Zach Wilson are, are exciting because I wasn't
*  the biggest Zach Wilson fan coming out.
*  I have, from what I've seen, I'm not, you know, super encouraged.
*  I think there's, there's good notes and there's bad notes, but the jets offense
*  is good, but the jets offense works right now, they have a great running game and
*  they've scrambled together this line well enough that they can get it done.
*  They have good receivers.
*  This team's working.
*  So that lets Zach keep playing.
*  Zach doesn't have to like make hero plays on every fourth down, like Justin
*  Fields to keep the team alive.
*  He can just run the offense that gives him the room to develop.
*  The guys like Lawrence and Fields don't have as much of right now.
