# NFL Guess the Lines Week 10 With Cousin Sal  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [November 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb88GNKWusg)
*  Okay, guess the lines
*  Ravens Bengals, what's the record by the way?
*  Five three one your head heading in a week 10, but I have I'd be shocked
*  I think I put myself as a plus 1400 today
*  Ravens at Cincinnati is the Thursday night game
*  And that's no it's the other way right since he had Baltimore
*  Oh, did I write that down wrong? Yeah, they already played in Cincinnati. It was 41 38. Yeah, my bad
*  All right, so I get that one I'm up on nothing good. That's an automatic forfeit
*  Well, this is an awesome Thursday night game
*  Very good dare. I say must watch
*  Mm-hmm, and I said this to Kyle today why and I've said this probably five of the nine weeks
*  We've done a pod but Lamar
*  Lamar and the multi view is still the MVP by far
*  I don't know if he's gonna win the MVP of the league, but he's so much fucking fun
*  We made the mistake 1710 in that Bengals game. I'd be in the Broncos game
*  Which I changed I took them off the floor
*  Not realizing that of course Lamar was gonna figure out how to score like a 60-yard touchdown in the last
*  Seconds of the game
*  Yeah, what was that?
*  I was glued to it at 41 10 because I needed Denver to win the fourth quarter
*  I was like, I'm so smart Baltimore's giving up 82 points in the fourth quarter in the last six weeks
*  I'm betting Denver blindly and they couldn't they went on fourth and go from the seven twice and they couldn't make it
*  But well, I finally I send in the 13 point tees to you guys. I finally lost it. I
*  legs was the
*  Broncos plus 22 and if I was the first loss I've had all year even so you had a shot
*  You had a little bit of a shot. I did go next had other ideas
*  All right. So if it's Ravens, I'm gonna forfeit my pick for this because I know it's okay
*  Just just guess it this I was actually somewhat close on this but but
*  Well, I would say Ravens by six
*  All right. Now you get it. I said five and a half at six and a half
*  That's a terrible way for me to lose that one. Yeah, six and a half happy to forfeit that one
*  No, it's not gonna matter. I promise it's not okay. I was so off
*  That's probably too many points right
*  Like the Bengals will be completely unafraid to go into Baltimore. Yeah
*  Just trying to think what they're
*  Trying to think if they'll ever have any chance of stopping Derek Henry. Well, I mean is that three hours
*  Yeah, Thursday night for four days after they just played
*  I kind of don't trust either defense and there was 79 points scored in the first game and I almost think the defense has got
*  a little bit worse. Yeah since then so
*  Well, I have a new category I've never done this before for the next one. Yeah, we've had the poop Fecta
*  We've never had a poop Fecta game in Germany as bad as this. So I looked up the German word for poop
*  Oh good, and it's cock a this is the cock a Fecta game
*  C a I'm sorry k a c k e Fecta. It's a cock Fecta
*  Giants Panthers
*  Yeah an outright travesty that can only take place in the Vega zone and I went Giants by four and a half
*  Yeah, you get it. I said four and it's five and a half. Mm-hmm
*  They can't make it big enough. I I'm still surprised at this
*  Sal I gotta be honest might not get up for this one. I was just gonna ask you what time you up for it
*  Probably a halftime and somebody will be up 17 nothing and I'm not sure which team do you have any fantasy players?
*  We got it because games are consumed differently now, right?
*  I'm a fantasy players none of the Giants definitely not on the Panthers. So none none across the board
*  Can I read you something you played our friend Brad and fantasy? He sent me a note
*  He said my team is well you I mean you decide how you want to take this
*  He says Simmons good dude excellent friend wonderful father dog shit at fantasy football
*  How can he say that?
*  I'm great. Did you tell about great? I am in the other league all of these descriptions are very much understatements. He writes
*  Sorry have a talk with him
*  It's a I spent a hundred twenty dollars and Garrett Wilson Cooper Cup and DJ Moore
*  DJ Moore had the opposite of a breakout year three point three points today
*  Yeah, yeah measles breakout basically
*  Travis at TN for 36 hours another mistake
*  Yeah, yeah, not great. Sometimes it's not you're in fantasy. I mean Brad did take nine running backs
*  Yeah, I know he was making fun of you too
*  I had to stop him because he was talking about how many quarterbacks you took I was like wait slow down
*  No, I like it. Yeah, I the problem is all my quarterbacks suck
*  I've a DAC who left the game early today
*  I mean how do I get 13 points out of DAC against the Falcons that should have been like a 30-point game. Oh, yeah, yeah
*  I don't know. I don't know. I can't stand it
*  Sunday marquee
*  So initially when I wrote all these down on Thursday I had Eagles Cowboys as the Sunday marquee
*  Yeah, I'm gonna keep it there, but I don't think it's the marquee game
*  But it's probably the most interesting game because you might be a different coach for you guys
*  You might have new coach after the game. You've the Eagles who are just an unintentional comedy
*  all over the place every game and
*  I'm gonna say Eagles by three in Dallas. Oh wow
*  I said four and a half. It's six and a half. Oh
*  Yeah, we're pretty bad. Wow, you're six and a half point eight
*  We're pretty bad. Wow, you're six and a half point underdogs at home. Yeah. Yeah. Wow
*  Well, I don't know means CD lamb has like this shoulder contusion, right?
*  DAC I mean I could just see these guys ballin right you could have a Cooper Rush game here. I
*  Wish Cooper Rush had
*  Been a little better when he came in. Yeah
*  Maybe that's like oh could have a quarterback controversy did that those words were not uttered during the Cooper Rush half hour that he played
*  No, take take the Cowboys plus twelve and a half. They'll cover that take them on a teaser
*  Definitely 100% not put it. I do want to give you credit though for your Thursday teaser
*  Like this is the way to play a teaser right like the Jets were one and a half point favorite ridiculous
*  They went to two and a half and you're like, oh, I'm over the touchdown
*  You took the Texans plus eight and a half, right?
*  Beautiful a little lucky at the end, but that's the way to do it a little lucky. Yeah, you know what I found out
*  Seven and a half used to be the number for me. But now like I lost on the Colts today at seven
*  I think it has to get to eight and a half on these uses when you're going the other way now
*  Seven and a half isn't good enough. There's 28 20s all over the place. Yeah, like you're right. Yeah watchables
*  I got four first one is bills at Indianapolis
*  For a couple reasons bills I think are just have just been a really fun multi-bute team all year. Yeah
*  Colts, I don't know the quarterbacks gonna be they just go back to Richardson next week. What do they do?
*  It's also like if the Colts lose this game, they're proud their seasons probably over. Mm-hmm guessing
*  Yeah, and and I feel like these teams play good games. So bills like a blacko. I think it's flacco again, but
*  Let's say bills by three. I
*  Get this. Oh, we split it. I said six. It's four and a half. Oh Vegas. Oh
*  Yeah
*  So the bills are we just the whole year?
*  I'm just never gonna feel that great about them and they're gonna go like 15 and 2. Yeah, I think so
*  Like do you watch them and go oh man look out for these guys
*  No, I don't but I'll tell you what just resonates with me the way they if they ever have to win
*  They just get it done the way they won the last three points. They'll get the three points
*  Yeah, or if they need to put together a street so they're over on the winds is twelve and a half
*  Still like it over. It's a plus 142. I still like it over. Is that unfundled? Yeah, I'm seeing they only have like nine teams listed
*  Twelve and a half plus 142
*  Yeah, they'll get it. So they'd have to go 13 and 4 the problem is they're gonna have the division clinched and probably the two seed
*  With like two weeks to go, right? So they'd have to go six and two
*  Yeah, why would it but they're gonna be the two seed though the one seed won't be clinched though
*  Right Casey's getting the one seed Casey's gonna go 16 and 1 or 15 and 2 right?
*  They play Casey
*  49ers Rams actually they do have a tough slate is they end twice in three weeks against the Patriots, but
*  Chiefs are home for the Broncos
*  I floated this out a couple weeks ago and I think it's official after the Baltimore game. I think Denver is the good bad team
*  in either conference
*  Good, I think they're officially
*  2024 is good bad. Oh, yeah, okay play the other bad teams. They're gonna win
*  You raise the level competition on them. They're losing. I thought you remember back us bad good team, but you're right
*  Yeah, they're the good bad team. Who else could it be? Who's um, who's in contention for that title?
*  I mean you could say anyone in the NFC South Arizona
*  Well, Arizona's a couple good wins though
*  Yeah, they're very close games. They're margin of victor except for today
*  In those games of very low no shots fired at our friends from Washington and I couldn't be happier for them
*  But I wouldn't rule out Washington for the good bad team either
*  well, it's funny you asked me did the
*  Hell Mary kill the Bears just just
*  Eviscerate him I think is the word to use but I feel like the hell Mary
*  And they won today. So it's a little less of a great point, but I feel like it didn't give them momentum
*  That game showed me that they've leveled off right watch them. They're not the team that punted twice in three weeks, right? So
*  They're gonna have to pull one out and a close one against the Giants every week. So maybe they're the good bad
*  Niners bucks in Tampa
*  and
*  I
*  Really had trouble with this one
*  Because I think Vegas is gonna respect the Niners a little more than maybe they deserve
*  So I'm gonna say Niners by three and a half at Tampa
*  That's exactly what I said and we were a whole field go off six and a half. Oh my god
*  So they're just jacking these lines now. Yeah
*  They are so now you have that in mind. Well McCaffrey's coming back right and Tampa's on a short week
*  I don't do you would you bet your life McCaffrey's coming back? No, I don't know. I just kept hearing trust that
*  Right, but they had to buy and now Tampa's on a short week and they still don't have those receivers
*  I guess we'll know better tomorrow
*  The last one might be this was the other choice for the marquee game and probably should have been the marquee game since the records
*  Are so good, but Jacksonville home there now what Washington at home for the Steelers? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah
*  It's a solid game. I'm gonna say Washington by two and a half. Wow, you nailed that
*  I said Pittsburgh by one tell me why they're their favorite Washington
*  Like if you did power rankings for these teams wouldn't Pittsburgh be ahead of them
*  It's the offense on Pittsburgh, I still don't think people trust it on the road
*  Yeah, that'll be it
*  So you think like these two teams are probably even and maybe a slight edge to Washington because they can score more points
*  I think this would be a team that they'd Washington would have trouble moving the ball on right more than anybody
*  Okay, two and a half that becomes a tease candidate pretty quickly, yeah
*  Yeah, right for sure. Well, they have seven point teasers
*  We're at the Fairly Watchables
*  You can't we're live
*  Vikings Jaguars in Jacksonville
*  Will coach middle see be at this game Oh
*  Yeah, yeah, you will
*  Great I think that guy just goes a lot longer than he's supposed to
*  He's the guy that we might still be making fun of next year. I
*  Think that's the boat I think Belichick is either Jacksonville or Vegas. Hmm
*  I don't think he'd mess with your team because your team's a losing hand
*  Belichick is having fun man. He's taking he's he's not into this coaching thing anymore. He's become like Jim Carrey
*  He's dressing up funny. He's like a physical comedian
*  He's done pose, you know posing with his mermaid girlfriend for Halloween
*  He's loving it
*  He's this is a year-long plan by Bill Belichick to prove that he's not like the grumpy curmudgeon that couldn't take over your
*  football team because that's probably why he didn't get a job because
*  Mouthing him and it's like this guy's of pain in the ass. He sucks to be around
*  He's so bad. This has been Belichick proving that there's actually a personality there
*  Which is what everybody who knows him is set so you think the next interview he pulls up that picture the mermaid girlfriend
*  It's like I think he's gonna keep my name on Thanksgiving
*  I think he's gonna be wearing an apron going on Chang show making turkey with Chang like I'm
*  He's on a quest to prove that there's a personality there Wow. I like all right. I
*  Don't like it. I like I like it better when he was a stiff and I can make fun of him
*  Vikings at Jags I have Vikings by two and a half
*  I get this one. I said four and it is four and a half square in the biggest. Oh, that's
*  If you're betting on Sam Darnold in Florida laying points on the road. Good luck
*  Good luck we just sit on Jacksonville for like an hour and a half
*  I'm not
*  Anyone who bets on this game is no lunatic. I'm with you. Are you worried about Raheem by the way?
*  Yeah, always yeah, well, I mean we're always worried about Reem but Reem Reem did well this week and he
*  You know, he starts tweeting how his wins and his demeanor and the text changes. I always get nervous
*  It's like watching the first 30 minutes of a movie where the main characters doing really well and you're like, oh no slow down, dude
*  He's he's gonna move to Vegas. So yes, there's a whole different
*  This is all
*  No, I know he said he made a mistake of ever moving away from it
*  I mean he gets he could probably just on comps live there for like two and a half years
*  Did he win character of the year for you? I think
*  I don't know what would have to happen in the next two months, right? Like he's just got a massive lead
*  Yeah, so Rudy would have to rack up like 14 DUIs in the next eight weeks
*  When you when you were coming back to the to the
*  To the ringer to do all this stuff with us and I was like, I can't wait to bring Raheem into your life
*  You just like one of the great gifts I've ever given you and it's exceeded all expectations. It's so good
*  It's a beautiful gift. What do you think he's in a sports book right now betting on like like cricket in
*  Argentina, I
*  Graduated him like look at you. You're you're I mean you're in Vegas
*  You probably woke up 14 minutes ago and you're hitting this with 35 trends and stats that no one's ever heard of
*  God bless you and you can't wait to get out of that seat and do it again
*  We we need like a ringer award ceremony where we can give him some sort of some sort of a word just an epic
*  Performance by him. Yeah, yeah, he's done a little bit of a tear. Yeah, Rehman. Yeah, he is hitting them not bad
*  Speaking of tears the Cardinals home in Arizona
*  Playing the New York Jets we did not talk about this game the stupid game the Jets won on Halloween night
*  Yeah with a Texans team that
*  You know just didn't have enough horses
*  I don't ever watch JJ's around
*  CJ Stroud, I don't like when he has bad games, you know or
*  Some
*  Power games, you know, like no I want that guy to be good every single time
*  But if you look at him on the road, then he got killed by the Jets last year. Yeah, it's weird. I don't like that shit
*  That whole game flipped on that crazy Wilson touchdown
*  I feel like the Jets were gonna lose the game and then all of a sudden they were winning and
*  It was very strange
*  The Jets were better in a game
*  But the Jets were better in a game
*  The Jets were better in a game
*  Cards home for the Jets, and I'm gonna say Cardinals by two and a half
*  Alright, so you got it. You got to talk me through this one, too
*  I said jets by two but you're right. It's a Cardinals by one and a half. So we're fully in. Jets aren't good
*  But the Jets were favored. So why were they favored against the Texans? That's what I'm asking. Thursday night game
*  I don't get this gambling thing.
*  I really...
*  Maybe I never did.
*  Poopfecta.
*  Bears are home for the Patriots.
*  And you know what?
*  It's officially Would You Rather Have Drake May or Caleb Williams Week?
*  And I know where I stand.
*  Uh oh.
*  And I know where I stand.
*  Don't say anything you're gonna regret.
*  I stand with Drake May.
*  Oh wow.
*  You know who else does? Kyle.
*  Kyle, who would you rather have?
*  Say it, Kyle.
*  That's a loaded question.
*  We love Drake May.
*  Listen, everyone's happy with their quarterback, but we love Drake May.
*  Good, you should.
*  And if they beat the Bears this week, I would be excited.
*  I think the Bears...
*  Ten football fan bases are happy with their quarterback.
*  I know, this might be a record.
*  I know.
*  Even the Vikings are like, hey, we got J.J. McCarthy next year.
*  Right.
*  The Raiders are going, well, we're not in that group.
*  I have the Bears favored by five and a half over the Patriots.
*  You edged me out.
*  All right.
*  I said five, it's six and a half.
*  Five, seven, you're up seven to four.
*  I really needed that one.
*  It's a field goal game.
*  Yeah?
*  Yeah.
*  Falcons at the Saints.
*  I can't imagine this not being in the Vegas zone, so I'm going to say Falcons by four and a half.
*  I get this.
*  I said three and a half.
*  It's only three.
*  Let me see if they updated it, if it's anything different.
*  Yeah, only three.
*  Three point favorite.
*  They played week four when New Orleans was a real team still, 26-24 final.
*  I'll tell you this, if Dennis Allen gets fired and we get a new Saints coach, I'll be taking the Saints for million dollar picks on Thursday.
*  Oh, really?
*  Because you know I love the new coach theory.
*  Yeah.
*  You don't even know.
*  Sight unseen.
*  I didn't know who the coach is.
*  It could be anybody.
*  Bezion Williamson is the new coach.
*  I'm taking the Saints.
*  Interesting.
*  Sight unseen.
*  Blind.
*  It's like when you do the blind soup.
*  It's like soup du jour on Postmates and taking it.
*  I liked it.
*  Chargers at the Titans.
*  I'm sorry.
*  Chargers home for the Titans.
*  And I think this line has to be Chargers by seven.
*  Man, you beat me by the half point.
*  I said six and a half and it's eight and a half.
*  You get it.
*  That's a tease.
*  Titans defense isn't bad.
*  Isn't it something we trust the Chargers to tease them now?
*  I guess we do.
*  Yeah.
*  Good coach and a good QB solves a lot of issues.
*  Titans defense is like top three in a lot of the metrics.
*  It's very weird.
*  Somehow, even though they gave up 52 points to Buffalo, but even in that one, the metrics
*  for the defense is pretty good.
*  Sunday night, Lions, Texans, and it's going to be in Houston, Texas in a dome.
*  Well, you missed one, I think.
*  What did I miss?
*  Denver Casey.
*  Did we do Denver Casey?
*  I literally missed.
*  Oh, I had that in the watchables.
*  Fuck, I just skipped over it.
*  That is a watchable.
*  I'll put it in the Fairly Watchable.
*  I have Chiefs home against the Broncos.
*  I have the Chiefs by nine.
*  Of course you win this one.
*  I should have let you forget it.
*  I said eight.
*  That's nine and a half.
*  It just feels like the Chiefs are just making it nine, nine and a half now because they
*  don't want you to tease the Chiefs.
*  Even this game tomorrow night has been between eight and a half and nine constantly.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, Denver, I think it's a good game.
*  That's going to be a tough defense for Knicks to look good in the first three quarters,
*  I think.
*  I'll tell you this though.
*  They were in that game today against Baltimore for almost the entire first half.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  Knicks missed a wide open guy for a touchdown on, I think, the first or second drive.
*  He had a guy in the fourth and two and the play worked and it was there and he missed
*  it.
*  It was a 30 yard touchdown.
*  Then he missed another guy for a touchdown, but it didn't matter because they ended up
*  scoring anyway.
*  But it was going to be 17-10 at halftime if they just get off the field and they were
*  hanging around.
*  Then that touchdown ended the game.
*  It was 24.
*  You're not winning after that.
*  24-10 with Bo Knicks, it's a wrap.
*  But 17-10 they were hanging around.
*  No, that was a game they had to make the most of every opportunity.
*  Yeah.
*  Sun and Night Lions at Houston and I have Lions by three.
*  Wow.
*  You set a record for nudging me by a half a point of my guess.
*  I said two and a half.
*  It's three and a half.
*  That's fair too.
*  I wonder where that lands because there won't be Nikko Collins, I don't think.
*  Diggs is out for the year.
*  Right.
*  There's going to be a lot of Lions talk about how they are clearly the best team now in
*  the NFC and are we getting Lions Chiefs?
*  I have a lot of Lions Chiefs stuff for the futures.
*  Yeah, I have Lions Bills.
*  That's what I'm on.
*  Lions Chiefs was 36-1 in August because I bet it was when I was in Boston on Fandel.
*  Looking real good.
*  I think the Lions are better.
*  I think this is a fair line, but you think it'll settle at three?
*  I think it goes to four.
*  I think they're going to make people, going to force people to bet Houston.
*  Pretty good rest advantage and plus this is the second road game for Lions.
*  Monday night Rams-Dolphins.
*  It's in LA.
*  Maybe we just go to this.
*  Oh yeah, Monday.
*  We don't know competing game here.
*  Did we just go to this?
*  We don't think we can.
*  The Trail Blazers are playing the Hawks and you're going to want to watch that.
*  Oh shit.
*  All right.
*  I'll look at the NBA schedule.
*  I might go to this.
*  We could go to this.
*  Why not?
*  It'd be nice if the Rams roll out the Ram carpet for us.
*  Veterans Day.
*  I went to the Quippers game yesterday.
*  Oh, tell me.
*  First one, the Arena.
*  I'll guess the Lions first.
*  Rams, I'm going to say Rams home.
*  Rams by four and a half over the Dolphins.
*  Oh, I'm glad I won the last one.
*  I said three and it's two and a half.
*  Oh, wow.
*  They don't believe.
*  Are they thinking there's going to be a lot of Dolphins fans?
*  Well, they'll be right about that, but doesn't mean they're going to play well.
*  All right.
*  So I won the week.
*  Good for you.
*  You're up six and you're up six, three, one.
