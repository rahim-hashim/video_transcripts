# Can the Depleted Lions Make the Super Bowl? Plus HOT Million Dollar Picks | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [December 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ)
*  All right. We were taping this right after the Lions Packers game in his 837 Pacific time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=0.0s)]
*  We were hoping that would be a really good game. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=5.76s)]
*  It seemed like it was going to be a really good game. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=7.44s)]
*  And then it was a really good game. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=9.64s)]
*  And even better, Packers plus three and a half covered. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=11.56s)]
*  My adjusted Packers plus four and a half with love 200 plus passing yards. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=15.6s)]
*  That covered one of my first million dollar pick already. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=20.28s)]
*  Um, Detroit had the ball 36 minutes house. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=22.88s)]
*  They had 280 yards passing. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=27.0s)]
*  They outgained the Packers by over 100 yards and felt like they dominated the game. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=31.24s)]
*  And yet. I kind of feel like the Packers blew it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=36.6s)]
*  They had the ball first down after that long completion over the middle. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=40.64s)]
*  And they were inside the 20 and then they all of a sudden they just kind of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=46.16s)]
*  settling for a field goal. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=50.24s)]
*  And I really feel like they had it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=51.440000000000005s)]
*  Well, it was, it was first and goal. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=53.68s)]
*  And there was to me a very suspicious pass interference, offensive pass interference [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=55.96s)]
*  call that pushed them way back. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=62.64s)]
*  Yeah, it didn't. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=64.64s)]
*  I mean, the number of times that occurs in a football game and it goes uncalled and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=65.56s)]
*  they were inside of it happened like virtually at the line of scrimmage. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=71.0s)]
*  So are you, wait a second. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=74.64s)]
*  Are you giving me, you think that we are headed toward a lions, bills, conspiracy [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=75.96s)]
*  Superbowl, the two losers, somebody has to win. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  This is good. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=84.52s)]
*  Now has now ordered that in. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=85.47999999999999s)]
*  Not only I love that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=87.11999999999999s)]
*  And you know, who especially loves it as cousin Sal, cause I think that was his [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  prediction for the Superbowl matchup for this season. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=91.6s)]
*  I like, look, I'm not going to, um, you know, say bad things about it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=95.84s)]
*  Detroit is an A-side team now. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=101.96s)]
*  Detroit gets A-side calls. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=104.08s)]
*  Well, explain that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=106.24s)]
*  Cause that's a Raheem phrase that you guys go and win your gambling show for my [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=107.08s)]
*  audience, they might not know what that is, but it's Raheem's best thing. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=110.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=114.88s)]
*  It's like his best theory. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=115.48s)]
*  I love it, but explain the A-side. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=116.68s)]
*  I'll try and do it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=118.28s)]
*  It's, it's when you've achieved a certain status when you have, and, and the, the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=119.24s)]
*  best example of it in the NFL is the chiefs where every week, it feels like every call [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  that might go their way does go their way. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=129.04s)]
*  Every ball that bounces seems to find the hands of the team that is the A-side [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=131.48s)]
*  team. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=136.64s)]
*  I think it's, it's basically that concept. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=137.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=139.28s)]
*  It's like the, it's a Monday night game. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=139.56s)]
*  Somebody's getting three and a half in their home and you could just tell in the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=142.92s)]
*  first quarter, the calls are going their way. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  And it's like, oh, they're the A-side today. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=148.6s)]
*  It's a good one. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  LeBron's been the A-side in the NBA for like 15 years. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=151.16s)]
*  Kind of. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=154.88s)]
*  The Warriors had a few A-side runs on their end too, but it's, it's a good theory. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=155.16s)]
*  Um, but yeah, and I felt like considering that love had 31 yards at halftime, they [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=161.0s)]
*  seemed completely blindsided by how good the, the Lions defense looked in that, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=166.76s)]
*  that first drive when they were just flying in and hounding them. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=171.0s)]
*  And then they found something with the run game. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=173.92s)]
*  Then they started taking shots deep. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=176.04s)]
*  And it felt like by the time we're in the fourth quarter, it actually felt like the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=177.64s)]
*  Packers were a slightly better team. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=180.88s)]
*  And then they just couldn't, couldn't hold the Lions off. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=183.16s)]
*  They got that fourth, that big fourth down stop. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=185.76s)]
*  And, uh, if I'm the Packers, I'm feeling good. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=188.96s)]
*  I can play with that team. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=192.88000000000002s)]
*  I can go in there in the playoffs in January and I can hang with that team. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=194.28s)]
*  And I I'm not like losing sleep. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=199.20000000000002s)]
*  You're going to be the wild card anyway. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  The entirety of that fourth quarter felt to me like whichever team has the ball [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  ass is going to win the football game, which is a testament to, you know, the, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  the matchup, but I just want to be clear. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  I know that I said the A-side thing about that dubious pass to the interference [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=213.64000000000001s)]
*  call, there was a holding call on Detroit in that last drive that was also [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=217.68s)]
*  ticky tacky felt a little makeupy and to Detroit's credit, they overcame that [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=223.64000000000001s)]
*  went right down the field. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=228.56s)]
*  You know, crazy Dan Campbell goes for it on a fourth down that, you know, had [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=230.24s)]
*  Jared golf, uh, falling over because he gets his foot stepped on by a lineman. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=235.56s)]
*  They still get the yards. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=240.56s)]
*  They still, you know, are able to just clinch the game that way, but that's [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=241.84s)]
*  so the way it goes when you, when your things are running in your favor. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=246.6s)]
*  On the nine text threads I was on during this game, most people thought [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=250.04s)]
*  Campbell was the lunatic. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=253.32s)]
*  I actually liked it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=255.4s)]
*  And it goes to what you said a minute ago. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=256.68s)]
*  It started to feel like a, whoever had the ball last game and he was going to, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=259.71999999999997s)]
*  if you kick a field goal, their love gets the ball on his own 30 with 43 seconds [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=264.92s)]
*  left, and I feel like they would have been able to go down the field and get [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=269.92s)]
*  in a field goal range. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=272.6s)]
*  So, you know, it's fourth and inches. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=273.48s)]
*  They didn't get it earlier to me. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=275.76s)]
*  A lot of these times I like when the lions go for it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=277.48s)]
*  There's other situations where I hate it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=281.36s)]
*  Like, you know, like the Jaguars, you know, when you can't really block and you [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=283.24s)]
*  have Trevor Lawrence and, you know, I just, I'm not confident you're getting it on [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=287.71999999999997s)]
*  fourth and two or fourth and four. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=292.52s)]
*  There's a bunch of teams like that with them. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=293.88s)]
*  I like when they, the play that they didn't get it, that Gibbs like pitch out [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=296.12s)]
*  play, I didn't like the play. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=299.4s)]
*  I like that they went for it, but just, you have this huge offensive line, just [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=301.44s)]
*  run behind it and push forward. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=305.04s)]
*  And it seems like teams always get into trouble when they try to get tricky, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=306.88s)]
*  you know, and they try to out trick themselves a bunch of times in this game, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=310.24s)]
*  which is why the Packers were able to hang around. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=314.36s)]
*  The thing that you said in our text thread, I think early in the second half, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  it did indeed feel like the lions could get 10 to 15 yards passing the football [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=320.16s)]
*  anytime they wanted it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=326.32000000000005s)]
*  And they ran really sharp plays in the red zone, both times fourth down those [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=327.84000000000003s)]
*  touchdowns that they got were really sharp play calls. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=334.2s)]
*  Ben Johnson in his bag BS. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=338.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=340.32s)]
*  The golf was 32 for 41 for two 83. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=340.56s)]
*  He'd won bad pass. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=343.76s)]
*  He stared the guy down through a pick, but they ran the ball Montgomery and [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=344.96s)]
*  Gibbs were 29 for 94. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=348.8s)]
*  I think what they were only 3.6 for Montgomery 2.9 for Gibbs, but I think the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=351.59999999999997s)]
*  reason they're trying to run the ball, I think they're trying to shorten the game. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=356.0s)]
*  I agree. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=359.52s)]
*  They didn't trust the defense. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=360.0s)]
*  Totally agree. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=361.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=362.0s)]
*  And, uh, so it just felt like I like when the lions play with pace because [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=362.68s)]
*  they have so many weapons, but I guess they feel like they can't do that anymore. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=368.08000000000004s)]
*  Cause it's such a Patrick defense, but a lot of people, uh, a lot of people [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=371.56s)]
*  writing online, people on pods have been making the same point that this whole [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=377.24s)]
*  conference feels like it's shifting toward Philly a little bit, you know, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=381.92s)]
*  like I heard Lombardi today talking about, he really feels like Philly, they [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=385.72s)]
*  have the second best odds to win the NFC, but you know, Philly's in a great spot, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=389.32s)]
*  whether they're the one seed or the two seed, the way their defense is playing. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=393.84s)]
*  Um, I, it, to me, the NFC feels way more wide open than it did a couple weeks [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=397.32s)]
*  ago and it's cause of the Detroit injuries, their defenses in the same. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=402.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=405.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=405.52s)]
*  I mean, wide open means what? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=405.96s)]
*  I, I, okay, fair enough. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=408.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=412.36s)]
*  But I thought there was a point about four weeks ago when it just seemed like [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=412.52s)]
*  Detroit was almost like, I'd bet anything they're going to make the super bowl. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=417.44000000000005s)]
*  This just seems like the dominant NFC team. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=420.96000000000004s)]
*  I just love the way they're playing. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=425.0s)]
*  Even after the Hutchinson injury, it still felt pretty great. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=426.32000000000005s)]
*  So I'm Fandel right now. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=429.44000000000005s)]
*  They have the conference stuff. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=431.96000000000004s)]
*  Detroit's plus one 40 Philly's plus two 50 and the Packers are eight to one. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=434.08000000000004s)]
*  Vikings are plus nine 50. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=439.36s)]
*  And we're going to talk about them later on million dollar picks, but there's some, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=442.12s)]
*  some pretty interesting defensive stats with them that are not encouraging. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=445.4s)]
*  Other than that, I don't see anyone else. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=448.56s)]
*  So it's those three in the NFC, but I feel like the Packers, I think they [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=449.96s)]
*  could go into Detroit and hang Philly would be a little tougher because of the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=454.0s)]
*  Philly defense and we need to know when JR Alexander comes back is the other thing. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=457.28s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=462.76s)]
*  That that's going to be huge. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=463.24s)]
*  Um, for, for green Bay, um, the, the Philly thing, the Philly advantage that they [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=464.68s)]
*  have is their own ability to, to just, you know, shrink the clock and run the ball, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=470.28s)]
*  especially in the second half of these games now. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=475.55999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, they're good. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=478.52s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=480.55999999999995s)]
*  Detroit has probably been on TV the most this year, other than maybe KC, right? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=481.28s)]
*  It's those two, but I feel like Detroit, I feel like I've seen almost all of their [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=487.84s)]
*  games. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=491.52s)]
*  Well, sadly we've, we've seen way too much of the mother f*****g jets. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=491.88s)]
*  Well, I mean the jets, let's shoot them straight into the sun. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=496.59999999999997s)]
*  But that's my point. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=499.28s)]
*  Usually like the MBAs in this situation now, they have just a s**tload of Laker games [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=500.16s)]
*  left. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=504.8s)]
*  They barely have any Cleveland games. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=505.12s)]
*  They barely have any Oklahoma city games. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=506.72s)]
*  Um, and a lot of times like the most televised teams, it turns out to be [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=509.56s)]
*  disappointing. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=514.08s)]
*  I love watching Detroit. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=515.28s)]
*  I really get it. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=516.88s)]
*  And I have, I have fantasy guys from them in different leagues and I'm sure that's [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=517.64s)]
*  part of it. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=521.96s)]
*  I had the one seed bet with them. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=522.4s)]
*  I had their over all kinds of stuff, but I just think they're really entertaining [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=523.9200000000001s)]
*  offensively, like about as entertaining of an offense as we've seen in a while. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=527.48s)]
*  And then the big thing that they added that they just didn't have in the first two [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=532.12s)]
*  months was, uh, this Tim Patrick, who I always thought was good on the Broncos. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=535.6800000000001s)]
*  He got hurt and he was healthy in preseason. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=542.16s)]
*  And I guess, uh, I guess, uh, Peyton, just like the other receivers, let him go. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=545.32s)]
*  And he's the third receiver that the lions have kind of been dying for. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=550.6800000000001s)]
*  Like he had a couple of really big catches today, but I think. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=554.28s)]
*  They just have playmakers everywhere. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=557.52s)]
*  And I always feel like that Packers didn't get that thing, tie game, four [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=559.7199999999999s)]
*  minutes left. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=564.4399999999999s)]
*  And it's like, fuck, you guys probably lost. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=565.0799999999999s)]
*  I don't think you're stopping the lions. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=567.7199999999999s)]
*  I think they're going to get into field goal range and win the game. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=569.28s)]
*  Like, didn't you have that feeling? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=571.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=572.5999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=573.56s)]
*  The only thing that put it into doubt at all was a crazy Dan Campbell going for it [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=574.2399999999999s)]
*  on that fourth down. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=578.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, I wonder. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=581.0799999999999s)]
*  I mean, I wonder like the pie chart of that decision-making where they didn't [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=582.36s)]
*  get it before. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=587.72s)]
*  And I do think there's like a attitude piece to when he's been doing this for [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=588.72s)]
*  three years, right? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=594.52s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=595.28s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=595.56s)]
*  And it's like, if I go for it here and we get it, I kind of win our swagger [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=595.96s)]
*  back. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=599.36s)]
*  If I kick the field goal combined with us not getting it before our swagger [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=600.2s)]
*  isn't like a tiny bit of a question. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=604.3199999999999s)]
*  And I, you know, he's just aggro. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=606.16s)]
*  That's who he is. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=607.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's true. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=608.72s)]
*  And I do wonder, it can't be part of the affirmative calculation when he's sitting [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=609.4s)]
*  there making the decision, but there is got to be something in terms of the [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=614.4s)]
*  identity. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=618.96s)]
*  Like this is who we are. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=619.4s)]
*  This is what we do. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=621.0s)]
*  We have to do it. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=622.0s)]
*  We don't waver from it. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=622.6s)]
*  We can't waver from our identity. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=624.32s)]
*  This is who we plow ahead. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=626.08s)]
*  We plow ahead. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=627.5600000000001s)]
*  And it did have the desired outcome, which was not giving the green Bay [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=628.6800000000001s)]
*  Packers the football back. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=633.04s)]
*  The nerds didn't like it. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=634.5600000000001s)]
*  It was like, I think 4% of the people that were there. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=635.64s)]
*  Probability was better if they just kicked it for winning the game, which I [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=639.8000000000001s)]
*  was surprised by. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=643.4000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=644.5600000000001s)]
*  But I liked it. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=644.88s)]
*  I thought, I thought they were going to get it. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=645.84s)]
*  I was judged to stuff by, do I think they're going to get it? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=647.2800000000001s)]
*  If I'm like, I was, you know, obviously root for the Packers with the plus [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=650.76s)]
*  points and, um, hoping that the lions would kick the field goal and really [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=653.84s)]
*  worried that not only were they going to get it, but they were going to be the [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=659.08s)]
*  thing where they like breakthrough and get the touchdown and I don't know. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=661.64s)]
*  It's just the whole thing made me nervous. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=664.4000000000001s)]
*  So is that, are the lions still the best team to you? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=666.48s)]
*  Sure. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=670.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=670.9200000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=671.52s)]
*  I mean, we're going to see Kansas city this coming week. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=672.2s)]
*  And I feel like we were gonna, we're, we're due for a Kansas city statement [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=676.9200000000001s)]
*  game and it might be this weekend. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=682.4s)]
*  It might be this weekend. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=684.84s)]
*  Well, that's nice to move into million dollar picks because we had Casey down [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=686.72s)]
*  as, as one of the possibilities. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=690.32s)]
*  Casey, the lions finally adjusted to back up what we've been watching week after [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=693.16s)]
*  week where they haven't been covering any of these games and they've been [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=699.36s)]
*  pulling wins out of their ass and every week the lines have been three to eight [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=702.6s)]
*  points too high for them and Fandle and everybody else who makes lines finally [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=707.28s)]
*  had enough of it and they made them three and a half point favorites at home [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=713.0s)]
*  against the chargers on a Sunday night that don't have JK Dobbins that, uh, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=718.08s)]
*  McConkies hurt and like, we'll see tomorrow on Friday. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=724.24s)]
*  Usually the guy doesn't practice on Friday. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=728.0s)]
*  It's usually a bad sign for playing. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=729.84s)]
*  He's been like their big play guy every third. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=731.6400000000001s)]
*  The only play guy. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=734.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=735.24s)]
*  Um, and I would have thought the line would be maybe six and a half. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=736.1600000000001s)]
*  I was going to say six. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=740.4000000000001s)]
*  All the odds makers were like, Nope, we've had it with the chiefs. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=742.0s)]
*  It's three and a half. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=744.96s)]
*  The chiefs are on a six game against the spread losing streak. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=746.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=752.04s)]
*  Incredible for a team with their winning percentage. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=752.44s)]
*  If you look at the history, there's some great numbers out there. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=755.68s)]
*  Action network team was doing it. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=758.28s)]
*  Some incredible numbers about a team with their winning percentage being on [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=760.52s)]
*  an oh and six against the spread streak. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=763.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=766.72s)]
*  And even if you look at their last, their last, uh, five, their last six [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=766.92s)]
*  wins beat the Niners by 10, that turns out to be a congratulations Vegas by [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=772.12s)]
*  seven, Tampa by six, Denver by two Carolina by three Vegas by two. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=778.08s)]
*  They beat Vegas twice by nine points combined. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=783.24s)]
*  And I think the odds makers have just had it and they're like, you know what? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=786.6s)]
*  So to me, it's a huge gambling opportunity because I don't love the hook, but it [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=791.2s)]
*  does allow us to use their money line and start combining it with stuff. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=797.4s)]
*  But, you know, the big thing for me with the matchup is just, I, a, not sure [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=802.68s)]
*  about the chargers at all. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=807.24s)]
*  Their best wins is I like them. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=808.6s)]
*  I've enjoyed betting on them. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=810.28s)]
*  I have them make the playoffs. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=811.3199999999999s)]
*  Like they're, they're better than a good, bad team. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=812.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure they're a good team. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=815.0s)]
*  Their best two wins were Denver by seven and Atlanta by four. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=816.76s)]
*  Denver is the only team with a winning record. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=822.1999999999999s)]
*  They beaten. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=823.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=824.76s)]
*  Casey's defense third against the run. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=825.24s)]
*  Chargers don't have Dobbins. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=829.04s)]
*  Their run game was non-existent last week. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=830.52s)]
*  Chiefs at home. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=833.4399999999999s)]
*  Chiefs kind of need to make some sort of statement at some point [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=834.68s)]
*  before we get to January. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=838.48s)]
*  And this just feels like the week. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=839.88s)]
*  I agree. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=843.4s)]
*  I mean, this is, you know, the, the weakness for Kansas city has been their past [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=844.0799999999999s)]
*  defense since the cornerback Jalen Watson got hurt. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=850.76s)]
*  That was against San Francisco. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=854.24s)]
*  We've seen a lot of teams get into that secondary that Kansas city secondary, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=856.1999999999999s)]
*  but the chargers are so one dimensional now. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=861.6s)]
*  And look, all credit to coach Harbaugh. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=865.36s)]
*  Amazing turnaround. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=868.9599999999999s)]
*  And they did exactly what they needed to do against stupid Atlanta, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=871.4399999999999s)]
*  which was just hang around, just be on the football field and let [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=876.04s)]
*  us win it for them. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=880.32s)]
*  Serve you up on a, on a Thanksgiving platter. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=881.4s)]
*  Here you go, guys. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=884.64s)]
*  We've got some nice leftovers for you. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=885.8s)]
*  How would you like to win this game? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=887.4399999999999s)]
*  And Herbert and the Chargers accepted, uh, openly. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=889.56s)]
*  Um, but that's not the chiefs. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=893.88s)]
*  That's not the chiefs at home. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=895.4s)]
*  That's not the chiefs only laying a little number like this. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=896.88s)]
*  Patrick Mahomes, uh, with laying, you know, under six like this, very good [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=899.68s)]
*  numbers, it's like in the 60 some percent range and they got extra rest. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=904.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=909.16s)]
*  That they're coming off of that Friday all the way back around to a nice Sunday. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=909.52s)]
*  I, this is, this could be a chief smash spot, but it could be a chief smash spot. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=914.36s)]
*  So do you like the minus three and a half or you like it a money line with [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=919.92s)]
*  somebody else because there's a money line situation that I really like. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=922.96s)]
*  I like it all. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=926.68s)]
*  I'll just tell you, I like it all. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=927.56s)]
*  I'm not afraid of any of it. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=928.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=930.56s)]
*  The hook scares me just cause they, the, the settling for field goal things. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=932.28s)]
*  They do have Pacheco back. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=936.0s)]
*  Tell me, tell me how the Chargers score 20 points. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=937.04s)]
*  I know. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=940.8s)]
*  I know. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=941.6s)]
*  Tell me how. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=941.8s)]
*  I know. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=943.64s)]
*  I'm with you. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=944.52s)]
*  So how's the, the ringer gambling show today, you were talking about, um, a [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=945.36s)]
*  parlay and I was listening to it and I already had it written down and I texted [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=949.64s)]
*  it to the thread, the, uh, the Sunday pregame thread before I heard you actually. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=954.6s)]
*  Toss out the parlay and it was basically the torn Achilles parlay. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=960.04s)]
*  It was cake, Minnesota against Atlanta. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=963.76s)]
*  And, and take Miami against the jets, short cousins, short Rogers. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=966.52s)]
*  This is, it's like, I think plus one Oh nine, something like that. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=973.12s)]
*  I mean, both of those guys left legs are shorter, so it makes sense. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=976.4s)]
*  And I like the symmetry of it. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=981.12s)]
*  And I, and I was like, I would love to do that. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=983.0799999999999s)]
*  I would love to bet against Kirk cousins again. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=985.5999999999999s)]
*  And, uh, and obviously Miami at home, I actually think Miami is a little under [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=988.16s)]
*  valued now because the Packers Thursday night game threw everyone off the scent. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=991.76s)]
*  But it was cold, cold weather Thursday night. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=996.9200000000001s)]
*  What the fuck do you think was going to happen? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=999.32s)]
*  They'd actually played well the weeks before that. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1000.6s)]
*  So let's be fair. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1002.9200000000001s)]
*  The, the, the dolphins offense was up to the challenge. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1004.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1008.0s)]
*  The dolphins defense would have no part of tackling in that. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1008.9200000000001s)]
*  They didn't want to be there. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1012.52s)]
*  They did not. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1013.72s)]
*  And then Atlanta's nine and 19 or the last 28 against the spread. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1014.84s)]
*  Worth mentioning. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1018.88s)]
*  Atlanta is not good. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1020.8399999999999s)]
*  No, they're there six and six. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1022.3199999999999s)]
*  They really could be three and nine, two and 10, a couple of plays. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1023.8s)]
*  And I was, I'm going to do minutes. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1027.6799999999998s)]
*  This sounds great. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1029.0s)]
*  And then I started looking at the Minnesota defensive stats, which I mailed to you. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1029.8799999999999s)]
*  And they're a little alarming and there's something I don't trust about this game. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1034.28s)]
*  My shit detectors going off because it's really like the make or break game [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1038.3999999999999s)]
*  of the season for Atlanta. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1042.9199999999998s)]
*  They're at an impasse with cousins here. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1044.9199999999998s)]
*  It's cousins going back to Minnesota. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1047.6799999999998s)]
*  Um, but I look at Minnesota, they give them a 29 in Green Bay, 31 to Detroit, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1050.52s)]
*  27 to Chicago, 30 to the Rams. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1054.36s)]
*  Last week, Arizona had 406 yards and 25 first downs in them and really kind [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1056.4399999999998s)]
*  of choked the game away. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1061.2s)]
*  They had the game. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1062.0s)]
*  They're up 19 and six. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1063.08s)]
*  They're in control. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1064.08s)]
*  And I just don't trust Minnesota and make the counter with just try to do [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1065.72s)]
*  your Kirk cousins counter and let's talk this out. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1071.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1074.8799999999999s)]
*  So what we've seen from him in virtually every game, except for the games against [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1075.16s)]
*  the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where virtually all of the yardage, all of the positive [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1080.8000000000002s)]
*  EPA for the Atlanta offense was generated from the enormous, uh, success that the [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1086.0800000000002s)]
*  Falcons offense had against Tampa in two games over the last three games. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1093.72s)]
*  Kirk cousins has this many I'm holding out, but giant zero touchdown passes. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1099.16s)]
*  And they were not against great, uh, defenses. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1104.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1108.96s)]
*  They were against the saints was one of those games. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1109.64s)]
*  I mean, I'll go back and, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1111.92s)]
*  well, the chargers have a good defense. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1113.0s)]
*  They had, but it was a short week and a travel week for the chargers and the [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1115.28s)]
*  Falcons had no problem moving the football up and down the field. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1119.84s)]
*  They just got to the red zone and puked all over themselves and Kirk cousins, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1122.72s)]
*  especially, you know, short arming and short legging and not moving and playing [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1127.0s)]
*  out of pistol and the guy that is the offensive coordinator for Atlanta, not [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1132.88s)]
*  covering himself in glory because we keep having this conversation about the [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1138.64s)]
*  Falcons, not putting Kirk cousins in a tenable position, a tenable situation. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1143.0800000000002s)]
*  They have two incredible running backs. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1148.5200000000002s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1150.16s)]
*  They try and set up play action. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1151.24s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1152.96s)]
*  Cousins single-handedly is, uh, taking wins away from this team. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1154.1200000000001s)]
*  And it's only going in one direction with him physically. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1161.28s)]
*  Uh, one of the guys in our threads shared that next gen stat. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1164.4399999999998s)]
*  Now I don't know how long next gen has been around. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1169.12s)]
*  Is it two years? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1171.56s)]
*  Is it 20 years? [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1172.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1174.28s)]
*  No quarterback. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1175.08s)]
*  No, there are no quarterbacks since next gen has been measuring the [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1176.1999999999998s)]
*  velocity of passes that had 20, at least 20 attempts and has not reached 37 miles [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1180.9199999999998s)]
*  an hour and Kirk cousins came along on Sunday and said, hold my beer. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1188.0s)]
*  Mother f***** I'm right here. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1192.0s)]
*  And you could see it. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1193.96s)]
*  I mean, they kept saying we watched that game. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1195.56s)]
*  He had no push out of his feet at all. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1198.96s)]
*  No push. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1201.04s)]
*  Would you want next gen stats to measure your peas since like you were a [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1201.84s)]
*  teenager to now miles per hour? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1206.12s)]
*  Can we get stats and bathroom? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1208.72s)]
*  No. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1210.64s)]
*  Oh, my P is down to 34 miles an hour. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1211.4s)]
*  I don't want, I don't want anybody measuring my bathroom before any sort of streams. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1214.4s)]
*  No. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1220.32s)]
*  Well, you compared cousins to Joe Biden on the, on the ringer. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1221.2s)]
*  What, what, what did you say? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1225.72s)]
*  Well, only in the sense that like, when you reach this point physically, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1227.16s)]
*  it only goes in one direction. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1230.8400000000001s)]
*  That was the point I was trying to make. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1232.28s)]
*  Like the case that people were trying to make over the summer, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1233.76s)]
*  Oh, the Joe Biden, he can over, he, behind the scenes is the sharpest attack. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1236.76s)]
*  There was no overcoming the thing because the thing was he's old and you can't, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1241.76s)]
*  it only goes in one direction every day that goes by. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1246.48s)]
*  You're one day older. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1248.8s)]
*  That's where cousins is right now. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1250.12s)]
*  It's not that he's in a rough patch. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1251.8799999999999s)]
*  It's not that he's working things out. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1253.6399999999999s)]
*  He's not, you know, uh, he doesn't have the yips. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1255.3999999999999s)]
*  He's not physically able. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1258.3999999999999s)]
*  He's literally physically unable to perform. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1259.8s)]
*  And that's why going up against a Brian Flores blitz heavy defense. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1262.9199999999998s)]
*  I know, but the defense hasn't been that good though. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1267.24s)]
*  It's the blitz. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1269.68s)]
*  It's the thing. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1270.36s)]
*  I get it. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1271.0s)]
*  It's the blitz. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1271.3999999999999s)]
*  It's not the secondary that I'm interested in. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1271.9199999999998s)]
*  It's the blitz. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1273.8799999999999s)]
*  So I think I'm this, I, I see the case. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1274.9599999999998s)]
*  I feel like I got so lucky last week, a million dollar picks with the chargers [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1279.08s)]
*  in that game where they just couldn't do anything and cousins just single [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1282.9199999999998s)]
*  handed, they delivered the game to them. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1286.36s)]
*  He did. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1287.84s)]
*  And I almost feel like I, I don't even want to play with house. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1288.32s)]
*  Fine. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1292.28s)]
*  Fine. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1292.6399999999999s)]
*  There's, there's another game I like with the, I like to me that the [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1292.9599999999998s)]
*  parlay is Miami and Kansas city. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1297.6s)]
*  And great dolphins home against the jets sauce gardener. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1300.4399999999998s)]
*  We're taping this on a Thursday night. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1305.04s)]
*  It's got a bad hamstring. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1307.1599999999999s)]
*  So he's either going to be playing hurt or not playing either, either [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1308.4799999999998s)]
*  scenario awful for the jets with the speed of the, of the dolphins. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1311.32s)]
*  Breeze hall is questionable for the 100 straight week. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1314.84s)]
*  The jets are awful. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1317.9199999999998s)]
*  They're one in five on Sundays. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1319.6399999999999s)]
*  They're one in six on the road. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1321.52s)]
*  Uh, they, um, no, they're one in either one in eight on Sundays, one in six on [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1323.6399999999999s)]
*  the road, they have three starters out on their offensive line, their left tackle [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1329.8s)]
*  and their entire right side, Miami's defense sneaky, good night against the run. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1334.3999999999999s)]
*  I think it's the pass improving, improving. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1338.9199999999998s)]
*  Well, I look at their, their two losses, right? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1341.72s)]
*  Two of them, a bunch of games there, but the games they've lost with two, they [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1344.2s)]
*  lost the Buffalo twice, they lost to green Bay, they lost to Arizona. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1347.12s)]
*  I don't think they're bad. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1351.04s)]
*  Well, you know, who likes playing against the jets who I'm ready to get in bed with [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1352.2s)]
*  two of these nuts, who would these nuts love playing against the jets. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1357.52s)]
*  He's three and oh, uh, straight up or whatever. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1362.4399999999998s)]
*  There's the numbers are very good. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1365.6s)]
*  And on top of that, their home and their offense is so much more comfortable. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1367.28s)]
*  They're all of the precision stuff. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1373.6399999999999s)]
*  The DJ is spinning his home Miami sound. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1375.48s)]
*  He might get back. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1378.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he loves it. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1379.6799999999998s)]
*  He loves spinning those Miami records. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1380.56s)]
*  He loves the Miami sound. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1382.32s)]
*  Oh, I think he's, I think he's breaking out some 45s for this game. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1383.84s)]
*  Shout out to Lombardi. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1387.72s)]
*  Hey, I think the DJ went into the attic and pulled some rare [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1389.1200000000001s)]
*  selections from the early nineties. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1393.84s)]
*  Let me, no, no, I want to ask you some yacht rock. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1396.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, he really, maybe he got inspired by the yacht rock doc. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1400.04s)]
*  Maybe he went grab some doobies. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1403.24s)]
*  Doesn't it look like he could be in the doc? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1405.0s)]
*  I mean, I missed opportunity. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1407.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1410.2s)]
*  The jets line. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1411.56s)]
*  I just don't see any, they seem like they're, if they're not the worst coach [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1412.6399999999999s)]
*  team in the league, they're one of the three or four worst coach teams in the [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1416.9599999999998s)]
*  league, they make penalties every week. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1419.6399999999999s)]
*  Rogers clearly just can't wait for the season to be over at this point. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1421.76s)]
*  Um, it's just a disaster. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1425.6399999999999s)]
*  So it seems like a great, it's a great, it's a great, it's a great, uh, parlay [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1428.1599999999999s)]
*  leg, it's a great teaser leg, however you want to put Miami. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1432.28s)]
*  Well, Miami, Miami money line, Casey money line is plus one or nine. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1435.36s)]
*  Great. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1439.6399999999999s)]
*  Great. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1440.36s)]
*  I'm in. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1440.8s)]
*  So we'll mark that one down. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1441.52s)]
*  The next one, you knew this was coming. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1444.1999999999998s)]
*  If you listen to this podcast, nothing I love more than a team that has fired [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1446.32s)]
*  their coach, who the players were rebelling against, then playing the next week. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1451.6s)]
*  I, it's not a hundred percent, but it feels like it's at least 80. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1457.28s)]
*  We just hit this with the saints, which we did not do. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1460.56s)]
*  You talk me out of it. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1463.0s)]
*  The fucking clogger came in, won a game outright. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1464.28s)]
*  You talk me out of it. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1467.28s)]
*  I'm, I've forgiven you. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1468.2399999999998s)]
*  But, um, but this, this bears Niners. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1470.12s)]
*  Well, it didn't happen for the jets. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1475.6799999999998s)]
*  The jets lost their first game. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1477.28s)]
*  No, but they remember that game though. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1479.3999999999999s)]
*  They, they kind of should have won and then they jets it up, but they did play [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1481.1599999999999s)]
*  better and then they kind of fucked it up. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1484.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1486.08s)]
*  The brick. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1486.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1487.3999999999999s)]
*  The bridge. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1487.76s)]
*  Oh, brick. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1488.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1489.36s)]
*  Um, I, I've watched a few of these bears games and they've had some lows, right? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1489.56s)]
*  They've had some games where they just look awful. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1496.1599999999999s)]
*  Um, but they've also had some pretty good moments and stretches and halves. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1499.16s)]
*  And, um, and I think they figured out something with Caleb the last couple [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1506.1200000000001s)]
*  of weeks, but just having them get rid of the ball faster, um, defense can [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1510.16s)]
*  create some pressure. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1515.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1515.92s)]
*  I just think, I think they could win this game. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1516.28s)]
*  It feels like a three point game to me. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1518.8s)]
*  That the bigger thing is this is a, this is a zag against a Niners team that [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1520.4s)]
*  feels like the season is going in the wrong direction, not just like not [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1524.3999999999999s)]
*  making the playoffs, but like, it's like, just kind of edging toward, Hey, are [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1529.04s)]
*  we sure Kyle Shanahan should be the coach next year? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1534.76s)]
*  Oh, I think the Niners fans if you talk to, yeah, that in the Niners fans [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1537.8s)]
*  worlds, there's a lot of Kyle Shanahan consternation right now. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1543.28s)]
*  I mean, they literally got what? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1548.12s)]
*  Uh, two thirds of, of a legit game out of McCaffrey over 13 games. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1551.52s)]
*  I'm not saying it's rational. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1558.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm just saying, I mean, he's literally the most important player in the league. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1560.1999999999998s)]
*  Like he's in the conversation for, you know, offensive player of the league [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1565.8s)]
*  every year that he's healthy. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1570.0s)]
*  I don't know, taking that guy out of the mix. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1572.1599999999999s)]
*  It seems like it, but, and they lose IU. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1574.1999999999998s)]
*  Defense isn't the same. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1577.76s)]
*  No, we, we see this in football every year. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1579.24s)]
*  With at least one team and sometimes two, the pedigree team that either just has [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1582.1999999999998s)]
*  way too many injuries or gets old. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1587.3999999999999s)]
*  And we just sit there for, we, I went against the Niners in that Packers game. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1589.6399999999999s)]
*  Like I've, I've had success going against them, betting against them, because I [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1594.52s)]
*  don't, I just, I just don't think they're good. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1598.6799999999998s)]
*  And even this game, I mean, that wasn't really going on on a limb with Brandon Allen. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1602.04s)]
*  I know, but the, but the lines didn't really reflect even that. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1606.8799999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1611.4399999999998s)]
*  And then it was like, I don't know. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1611.76s)]
*  I just thought the way they were being measured, their past tense team to me is my [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1613.36s)]
*  point. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1618.7199999999998s)]
*  Fine. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1618.9599999999998s)]
*  Fine. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1619.4399999999998s)]
*  Fine. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1619.84s)]
*  They're not a present tense team. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1620.12s)]
*  They're not an arrow pointing up team. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1621.4399999999998s)]
*  I think the Bears can beat them this week. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1623.6799999999998s)]
*  And I love the new coach bump. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1625.1999999999998s)]
*  The only thing that I'm concerned with is like, when's the last time the [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1627.1599999999999s)]
*  Bears won a game on the road. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1630.9599999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1633.9599999999998s)]
*  It's been, it's been, that was one of the Ibrafluis hallmarks, like, Oh, go find him [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1634.6s)]
*  on the road and load up against, against the Bears because they just don't. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1639.56s)]
*  The thing that worried me looking at the stats was just the Bears run. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1644.6399999999999s)]
*  Defense has been bad. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1647.6s)]
*  I think they're like 27th against the run. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1648.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1650.96s)]
*  The Niners are obviously a good running team, but they're, they're down to Isaac [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1651.3999999999999s)]
*  Garando. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1654.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1655.6s)]
*  Their third stringer, right? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1655.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1657.12s)]
*  The fantasy darling this week and Trent Williams has hurt my play, my knot. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1657.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1662.48s)]
*  Um, yeah, that was the, for, for that Buffalo game, as soon as Williams was out, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1662.84s)]
*  I was like, Oh, I can't have enough Buffalo. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1667.64s)]
*  Put all the both Buffalo on my plate. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1669.48s)]
*  That was my Thanksgiving dessert. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1671.68s)]
*  So Bears plus three and a half or Bears in a tease or bears adjusted or bears [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1673.96s)]
*  money line, what hardens your nipples out of those? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1682.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, it depends on what color Caleb's fingernails are, but starting from there, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1689.88s)]
*  um, I I'd like the bears like in a tease. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1695.44s)]
*  That's the only thing that makes me feel comfortable. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1698.92s)]
*  I don't because the Niners, you know, had two diabolical situations in that green [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1700.8000000000002s)]
*  Bay and Buffalo back to back. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1706.88s)]
*  And I'm worried that there's like the basic operating function. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1709.0s)]
*  Now, again, let's see if Trent Williams is playing that that'll be a determining [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1713.2s)]
*  factor, but out of all of the options you're giving me, the bears in it with a [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1716.8000000000002s)]
*  tease leg is my, uh, favorite. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1721.44s)]
*  All right. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1724.52s)]
*  So what if I gave you the bears plus eight and a half? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1724.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1727.88s)]
*  In the Steelers money line against Jamison, the Browns, which is minus one [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1729.1200000000001s)]
*  10 on Fandel there, we're now we're talking. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1734.28s)]
*  That's a good one. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1736.56s)]
*  And that's our bet. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1737.6000000000001s)]
*  Um, love that one. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1738.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1739.6000000000001s)]
*  So Steelers game Cleveland has the, uh, really tough, exciting game in Denver in [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1740.24s)]
*  altitude on Monday night, six days later against Pittsburgh in the Denver game. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1747.96s)]
*  So my buddy, Gus Ramsey, huge Denver fan, and he was telling me the D back that was [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1752.96s)]
*  out was going to have a dramatic effect on the game because the guy that was going [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1757.6s)]
*  in for him could not cover anybody. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1761.68s)]
*  And he's like, I'm a little nervous about Jamison this game. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1764.1599999999999s)]
*  Cause we have this guy that I think, and guess what that guy gave up like 200 [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1766.56s)]
*  yards, but, uh, so I think that's made people think the Browns are a little more [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1770.8799999999999s)]
*  explosive than maybe they actually are. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1776.8799999999999s)]
*  So you sent me some Brown stats. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1779.04s)]
*  The Browns have lost 20 consecutive regular season games at Pittsburgh. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1781.84s)]
*  Their last win was October 2003 with Tim couch. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1785.3999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1788.84s)]
*  I had been living in LA for less than a year. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1789.6399999999999s)]
*  And then in Mike Tomlin's career with the Steelers, no opposing QB has gone to, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1791.52s)]
*  you know, against the spread against him in the same season, straight up against [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1799.48s)]
*  him, straight up against him. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1803.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1804.9199999999998s)]
*  Straight up straight up. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1806.1599999999999s)]
*  So Jamis beat them, beat them in that fluke stupid Thursday snow game. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1807.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1811.84s)]
*  Which had all the makings of a stay away. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1812.32s)]
*  And then it turned out it was. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1814.1999999999998s)]
*  And I continue to think the Steelers teams a little undervalued. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1815.56s)]
*  I actually think this line should be higher than six and a half, but I'm [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1821.0s)]
*  delighted that the money line is only minus three 10 and I feel like this is a [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1823.9599999999998s)]
*  gift from the gods and we have to put it in somewhere. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1828.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1830.6799999999998s)]
*  I like that a lot. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1830.8799999999999s)]
*  I like the money line just fine over history in these division games. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1832.12s)]
*  When Pittsburgh has been favored around six, uh, in that neighborhood, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1836.9199999999998s)]
*  it doesn't, you know, the, uh, underdog division opponent tends to cover. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1841.6000000000001s)]
*  Um, and that's been, you know, sort of the, the Tomlin thing. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1847.52s)]
*  You, you grab Tomlin and the Steelers when they are underdogs and you fade them [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1850.32s)]
*  against the spread when they're faves. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1854.88s)]
*  But this is a situation where we're just looking for the Steelers to win. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1857.2s)]
*  I don't want to mess around with the points. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1862.28s)]
*  I mean, the, the, the ceiling and the floor with Jamis are, it's like, you [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1864.44s)]
*  know, Mount Everest, uh, you know, the, the, the variance there. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1870.12s)]
*  So let's just go ahead and pick the Steelers to win, have that be a leg. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1873.36s)]
*  And then that, then we can move on with our lives. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1877.8799999999999s)]
*  So Steelers, you could tease them with the over of 37 and a half, which I [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1880.6399999999999s)]
*  wanted to discuss quickly, even though it's December, a little colder, but. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1884.76s)]
*  The fact that the Browns will not be able to run the ball at all and Nick Chubb, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1889.8799999999999s)]
*  I love Nick Chubb, but it really feels like, uh, maybe he should have sat this [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1894.04s)]
*  year out, but they're not going to be able to run the ball, which means they're [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1897.32s)]
*  going to throw it a lot, which means the ball is going to be in play all over the [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1901.04s)]
*  place. Raheem had an incredible stat today on the, uh, on the gambling show [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1904.36s)]
*  that Jamis actually broke the passing yards record. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1910.04s)]
*  If you include the 190, whatever interception yards that he had, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1912.6399999999999s)]
*  his own yards, he was like 600 yards. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1917.76s)]
*  680. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1920.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1922.08s)]
*  Nearly 680 combined receiving yards. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1922.6399999999999s)]
*  But Raheem said that every interception is like, has a five point impact on the [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1925.8s)]
*  spread. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1930.16s)]
*  Jamis is good for probably two interceptions in this game. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1932.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1934.92s)]
*  It just seems like 37 and a half lowering that with the Steelers, like as a tease. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1935.24s)]
*  That's another way to go. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1941.6s)]
*  And then then we're not relying on the Bears. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1942.64s)]
*  We like the Steelers that much. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1944.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1945.96s)]
*  I mean, it's a danger zone when you start messing with the points in these [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1946.1200000000001s)]
*  AFC North games, especially in December, we recognize the risk, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1950.6799999999998s)]
*  but if the weather doesn't look like it has a high chance of precipitation, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1955.52s)]
*  it looks like it's just going to be 40 degrees cloudy-ish. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1960.6399999999999s)]
*  The wind doesn't look insane. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1964.2s)]
*  Um, so those are still, because we, we, we think that with Arthur Smith, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1966.3999999999999s)]
*  you know, it's a miracle. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1971.32s)]
*  They get rid of that bum met Canada and all of a sudden they have four games [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1972.96s)]
*  where with both Justin Fields and Russell Wilson, all of a sudden Pittsburgh [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1977.72s)]
*  can, can get gained 400 yards on offense. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1983.0s)]
*  All again, it's a, it's a goddamn magic act. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1985.64s)]
*  Kudos to Arthur Smith for, you know, getting his bag, cooking up some offense. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1988.88s)]
*  It's fun to watch. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1994.4s)]
*  And is art did Arthur Smith or did he revitalize Russell Wilson's career? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=1995.68s)]
*  Because there's a whole case of that. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2001.6000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2003.8s)]
*  Wait, you can, you can look at Arthur Smith and just be like, who was the [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2004.96s)]
*  quarterback that he had to work with? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2007.72s)]
*  Everybody he had as a quarterback in the Falcons is not a [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2010.08s)]
*  starting quarterback in the NFL. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2012.52s)]
*  I mean, Ritter played a couple of weeks because three guys got hurt. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2013.92s)]
*  But you know, maybe he was a good coach just in a bad situation. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2017.6s)]
*  I don't know what to think, but he's completely reinvigorated Pittsburgh. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2022.36s)]
*  There's another snare. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2025.6s)]
*  I'm just going to throw at you since it seems like we like the Pittsburgh [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2026.52s)]
*  Moneyline, the Casey Moneyline and Miami Moneyline the most. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2029.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2032.8799999999999s)]
*  You put those three together. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2033.28s)]
*  That's plus one 77 on Fandl. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2034.36s)]
*  So I wouldn't do a full, you know, allocation like, like you like to do. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2038.36s)]
*  I wouldn't do a full 200,000 on, on that one, but I mean, that's worth 100 grand. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2042.12s)]
*  That's worth 50 grand. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2046.76s)]
*  It's nearly as, you know, one and three quarters to one. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2048.24s)]
*  We'd like that. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2052.8s)]
*  Minnesota. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2054.8s)]
*  Yes or no. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2055.4s)]
*  I mean, I'm all in on it. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2056.8s)]
*  It's a smash for me. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2057.96s)]
*  I love Minnesota. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2058.84s)]
*  I think they're going to kick the living crap out of Atlanta. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2059.64s)]
*  There's all kinds of numbers that, uh, about Kirk indoors. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2063.0s)]
*  He stinks indoors. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2068.16s)]
*  She's been playing. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2069.56s)]
*  He had all those years in Minnesota, but he's not, he hasn't been good. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2070.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of angles if you want to fade, uh, Atlanta, but the biggest [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2073.44s)]
*  one is, um, he's he is one legged cousins. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2078.4s)]
*  I really do like the symmetry of the cousins with Rogers T parlay fade the frauds. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2082.48s)]
*  So would you put Steelers with Minnesota or the bears? [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2092.28s)]
*  Uh, definitely Minnesota. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2096.56s)]
*  Cause I, I mean, I'm going to put Steelers with Minnesota and then if Minnesota blows [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2098.12s)]
*  it, it's my fault. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2102.64s)]
*  I just get to blame you and call you a motherfucker and send you nasty texts. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2103.92s)]
*  You can do that. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2108.52s)]

*  You see these teams hold onto the coach for the extra year when we [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2293.4s)]
*  already know the jig is up. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2297.2000000000003s)]
*  Doofy doofus. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2298.76s)]
*  What's the redemption story? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2299.92s)]
*  Thomas Brown, your guy, the new head coach this week. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2301.88s)]
*  This is when it starts. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2306.1600000000003s)]
*  We've seen the green sprouts shooting up of Caleb, you know, getting rid of the [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2307.6000000000004s)]
*  ball quickly that offense gets cooking. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2312.6400000000003s)]
*  The team likes him. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2314.28s)]
*  DJ Moore is alive for fantasy football playoff time. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2315.52s)]
*  I know. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2320.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2321.16s)]
*  So bears plus three and a half new coach theory. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2321.36s)]
*  It's almost a blind for me at this point. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2324.64s)]
*  You talked me out of it with the clogger and the saints. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2326.4s)]
*  I resented you for it. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2329.2799999999997s)]
*  We're doing it here. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2331.04s)]
*  And also a chance to short the Niners because to really have a season from hell, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2332.32s)]
*  you got to keep losing in December. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2338.44s)]
*  Like they haven't clinched season for us that you still have to have a [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2341.2799999999997s)]
*  couple more losses. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2344.4s)]
*  So we're going to do that. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2345.32s)]
*  And then last but not least, we love the Steelers at home against the Browns. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2346.12s)]
*  Just like Jamis coming off Monday night. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2351.84s)]
*  Like, yeah, he's not beating Tom and twice in the same season. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2354.2000000000003s)]
*  Steelers need the game. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2358.04s)]
*  Yeah, they really need the game. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2359.6s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2360.84s)]
*  Oh, we got caught by surprise. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2361.6800000000003s)]
*  We relax like they, they need every game. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2363.48s)]
*  They're trying to win their division and get either the two seed or three seed. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2365.84s)]
*  Yep. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2369.08s)]
*  So we're putting the Steelers in a tease in a Moneyline thing with the, uh, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2369.96s)]
*  with the Vikings. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2374.2400000000002s)]
*  Like it. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2375.28s)]
*  And the Vikings are minus five and a half. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2375.76s)]
*  So we're throwing the Steelers in with the Vikings, which you insisted on because [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2378.6000000000004s)]
*  they're going against Kirk Cousins who basically died last week and turned into [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2382.0s)]
*  a chalk outline that resembled John Jastremsky watching the Miami Dolphins [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2387.28s)]
*  playoff game in my house. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2390.96s)]
*  Well, I think he died like a month ago, but we finally caught on. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2392.36s)]
*  We finally realized. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2395.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2396.96s)]
*  I have just on the record as saying my shit detector was going off with this [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2397.2s)]
*  game. It seems too easy. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2400.4399999999996s)]
*  The Minnesota defense, I think it's a little overrated, but you talked me into [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2401.9199999999996s)]
*  it. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2405.48s)]
*  Steelers Vikings. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2406.16s)]
*  It's minus one 19 on Fandel. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2407.6s)]
*  Just that has to win. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2409.6s)]
*  And we take it. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2411.3599999999997s)]
*  We're putting 200 K and now we're putting 200 K on the bears plus three and a [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2412.08s)]
*  half as well. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2417.48s)]
*  And then you know what else just for fun, just for shits and giggles. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2419.3599999999997s)]
*  Let's hear it. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2423.52s)]
*  Little 50 K extra plus one 77 Steelers Miami KC all to win. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2424.44s)]
*  Little extra. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2432.92s)]
*  We do like it. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2433.88s)]
*  Little sprinkling. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2434.6800000000003s)]
*  Who F's us. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2435.84s)]
*  Let's play who F's us on that one. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2437.08s)]
*  Not KC. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2439.0s)]
*  Miami's always worries me. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2440.1200000000003s)]
*  I agree. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2441.56s)]
*  That is the answer. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2442.44s)]
*  The disc jockey and Tua taking a hit. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2443.1600000000003s)]
*  Who knows. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2446.52s)]
*  One last hurrah. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2446.8s)]
*  Anyway, those are the million dollar picks for week 14. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5W9IiaPTQ&t=2448.4s)]
