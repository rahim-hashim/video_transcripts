# Bill Simmonsâ€™s Super Bowl LVIII Props | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [February 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9kJ2iY-Vb8)
*  Well, we've had a week to stare at this super bowl with the chiefs and the niners.
*  And when we did guest aligns last week, I think I guess one and a half and bounced
*  around, it was one and a half to now it's two and a half as we tape this on a Sunday
*  night, where does it go?
*  Where does it land?
*  Where does it end?
*  Well, you're going to give me the title because I, yeah, you, you changed your
*  guest to Tic Tac one and a half and I had two.
*  So now it's two and a half.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't think this.
*  I don't think it'll go to three, but I just from casual people you talk to you,
*  you've been on the road for a week now.
*  Everyone's asking who you're picking and every bonehead is like, I don't know.
*  I'm taking the chiefs, right?
*  Yes.
*  And so is the money that sharp that it could turn to niners minus three.
*  And is that even the right side anyway?
*  I don't know.
*  Well, and we even did this.
*  I'm guilty of it.
*  The podcast we did last Sunday night.
*  Never betting against my homes again.
*  I, the more I thought about that game over the next two days is I'm flying around
*  and walking around, trying to get my steps in and just thinking about what, how did
*  I go wrong?
*  How did I get both games wrong?
*  Cause I really liked my picks and I'm looking at it and I'm like, the chiefs
*  didn't score in the second half.
*  Right.
*  It scored 17 points.
*  Like Baltimore was the right pick.
*  They fucking sucked.
*  They, they stunk.
*  Even if you go, the Zay flowers reach, reach over and the throne of triple coverage,
*  you just get changed to the outcome of those two plays and maybe they win.
*  But, you know, I, I don't feel like the Ravens were the wrong pick, but what I
*  will say, what I have thought about over and over again, I'm not the first person
*  to make this point.
*  It does feel like my homes is at this level now where he sikes the other team
*  out or he sikes the other QB out.
*  There's some sort of, especially when he gets a lead and the other team just
*  completely panics and changes our identity.
*  The podcast we did a week ago, we were like, why, what happened to the Ravens?
*  Why'd they panic?
*  What happened to Lamar?
*  Why didn't they run the ball?
*  And it's like, there's something about him and Brady, I think had this too, where
*  you're just like, and you get discombobulated and I'm sure they must be
*  watching that tape now and they must be like punching themselves in the face.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I think there is an element of, um, uh, a grownup playing, you know, one-on-one
*  basketball with his six-year-old son.
*  Like, all right, I'll let you shoot on me and I'll let you score or whatever.
*  But when push comes to shove, I'm going to hit Valdez Gambling on a play that's
*  going to be everyone else's best play of the year, but it's just like my home's
*  his 50th best, so it's tough.
*  I think we're probably waiting on giving our picks, right?
*  We're going to need a whole bunch of props today, but one way I'm looking at
*  it is which units surprised you the most from these two teams?
*  I can't believe how good the chief's defense is.
*  I think they've allowed three points in the fourth quarter for all
*  three playoff games combined.
*  And I can't believe how weak the Niners defense is.
*  So those are my two surprises.
*  That's kind of how I'm going to start to analyze it.
*  I think from there.
*  Yeah.
*  Was, was he, of fun, get this good that their whole defense collapse?
*  I was looking, I'm leaning toward the chiefs and it might change by the time we
*  get to Thursday, but I was looking at the, the, uh, the San Francisco defensive stats
*  just for Detroit, Green Bay and the Baltimore game near the end of the year.
*  You know, Detroit had 28 first downs, the Forger 42 yards.
*  They ran 29 for 182.
*  And they blew a couple of fourth downs.
*  They had a fumble in their own territory.
*  You know, it's, it, they moved the ball the whole game and they, you know, that's,
*  that was one of the worst losses we've seen in a while where your coach screwed
*  stuff up, your players made bad plays at the dumbest times you lost an interception
*  that hit somebody in the helmet, bounced in the air for 50 yarder.
*  Um, Green Bay, the week before three 30, 21st downs, they ran for 28 for 136.
*  And then Baltimore that near the end of the season, three 43, 23 first downs.
*  They ran 26 for 102.
*  And the chiefs feel like they're in the proximity of those offenses.
*  Maybe they're not as explosive as Detroit, but they're not going to be like worse
*  than those offenses, right?
*  And what they're not going to do is they're not going to abandon what's working.
*  Right?
*  So you said Aaron Jones is running all over, right?
*  Uh, 49ers as was the Montgomery Gibbs combo was giving them a fit.
*  Uh, they seem looked faster than a Niners defense.
*  You know, I, I don't, I think Andy Reed.
*  And plus the whole thing when he has two weeks to prepare all that stuff, throw
*  that aside, but yeah, I don't think they're going to screw that part of it up.
*  Joe house.
*  I don't know.
*  Do you know him?
*  He he's does some stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  Good eater in his day.
*  Yeah.
*  He, uh, he put his foot in the sand of San Francisco would not be the fourth
*  best team in the AFC was one of his takes on East coast bias on Thursday, which.
*  You know, San Francisco is pretty explosive at least.
*  You got to give it to their offense, but I, I keep playing this game out of my head.
*  You saw what Kansas city did last week where that first hour, we talked about
*  it last week on the pod, they just threw the kitchen sink at San Francisco and,
*  you know, Pacheco and 14 carries Kelsey had nine catches rice had six catches.
*  Like they, they ran all their best plays for like an hour and 10 minutes.
*  And then they kind of held on on the flip side.
*  Purdy, um, really takes a while to get going.
*  I was looking at some of his splits and stuff and you can see it.
*  Like if it goes first quarter, second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter,
*  he gets better as the game goes along.
*  He, he, by the fourth quarter, he's 12.2 yards per pass the first quarter.
*  He's like eight and it takes him a while.
*  And one of the things I was thinking about was the super bowl, which we
*  always talk about how disjointed it is.
*  And yet, you know, the pre-games forever and it's hard to get it on the field.
*  You're on the field and it's just everything that's going on.
*  If everything feels so long, then you have the first half and then you have
*  this 40 minute halftime and then you go again.
*  I think it's a real disadvantage for a first time quarterback.
*  So the combo of Casey starting fast and then Purdy starting slow that I keep
*  thinking about that in my head, right?
*  Yeah.
*  It's not even starting.
*  I mean, definitely starting slow, but he plays a different game.
*  Doesn't he?
*  Like the first half or first quarter and a half, he will let the
*  pocket crumble around it.
*  Like he doesn't take off.
*  He's got like three 15 yard plus runs.
*  They're all in the second half.
*  Like, like, what are you doing?
*  Why are you letting this?
*  Why aren't you stepping up in the pocket?
*  He did that against Green Bay.
*  He did that against Detroit.
*  It's going to be tough if he does that against Kansas City.
*  I feel like he'll go down a lot if that's the, and it combined with the
*  butterflies and everything else for a first time quarterback.
*  So I'm going to throw narratives at you.
*  The game is over on Sunday.
*  You're your stuff.
*  Cause you ate too much.
*  You're probably mad because you, you probably lost more than, than you won on all
*  the, your collective bets.
*  You're a little groggy.
*  Probably had $11,000 on the chiefs who covered in one.
*  And then I lost 16 grand in props.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  That's probably, yeah.
*  And now you're thinking about us doing the pod that night.
*  What's the lead of the pod?
*  Let's talk about the possibilities.
*  The, the one would be if it was an incredible game and we say, oh my God,
*  that game, we do that thing.
*  The second I think would be my homes.
*  All right.
*  This is, this is three now.
*  This is, you know, this is, this is now officially on and all day we go that route.
*  Then there's a Brock Purdy going that way, or it's like Brock Purdy.
*  Unbelievable.
*  Mr.
*  Irrelevant.
*  How did he do this?
*  Nobody thought ever all the money was on the chiefs, the line dropped to one.
*  What other narratives could you see leading the podcast a week from now?
*  You're saying positive, right?
*  Because this would be a good.
*  When for us.
*  Yeah.
*  Because I, I have to say one of my new year's resolutions was to try to analyze
*  these games from a positive perspective.
*  And it's not easy to do.
*  Right.
*  You want to go after how did the lions blow that?
*  Dan Campbell sucks that.
*  That's your first thing, but I think those are all good.
*  Uh, Shanahan got the monkey office back.
*  That'll be a big thing.
*  Right.
*  Uh, what if that, what if there was a Kelsey MVP Taylor Swift Grammys tonight
*  announced her new, new album.
*  I think it's called dead poets society.
*  I didn't get the title.
*  Sounds right.
*  Whatever it was.
*  Um, but Kelsey wins the MVP.
*  He kisses Taylor Swift.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh my God, we're going to Disney and everybody, the half of the nation just
*  gets completely pissed off and we're like close to a civil war after that.
*  They go into the blue tent.
*  They had, they had into the blue tent.
*  A camera opens it up, catches them nude.
*  We have to reproduce.
*  We have to create the most special baby America has ever had.
*  Super baby.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that's, well, that'll probably, honestly, no matter what, that's
*  going to be it, right?
*  Taylor was good for this team or all the league fixed it so that the chiefs won
*  or yeah, screw you conspiracy theorists.
*  The Niners won by 10.
*  So what are you talking about?
*  Right.
*  I think we have to lead that.
*  I'm glad we talked this out because you're right.
*  Either way it's, it's Taylor Swift and Travis Kelsey somehow becomes the lead.
*  Maybe not on our podcast, but just in general.
*  Okay.
*  We're into some props.
*  This is your favorite.
*  I would say, I don't know how many days, how many days have you been immersed
*  in props now at this point, like three or four?
*  It's a lot.
*  And yeah, there's only been a few instances where there's been one week
*  between the championship games and the Superbowl, but I almost think like it's
*  almost too long to study for a final exam.
*  I mean, he did a great job fandal with these and they're like, no, no, there's
*  more to come early, late on middle of the week.
*  I was like, it's like when you come home from college and your mother's
*  corn fritters and then coconut shrimp, it's like, stop, it's too much.
*  It's too much fried food.
*  I need to say that.
*  Yeah.
*  I found, I found almost everything I wanted to find.
*  They don't have some of the cross-sports stuff yet.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause it's, you gotta, it's too hard with the NBA to even know who's playing,
*  but let's go, let's just throw some favorite props out.
*  You go first.
*  All right.
*  I'm going to throw a couple.
*  Well, first of all, let's start at the beginning.
*  Well, first of all, let's start at the beginning.
*  Tales, um, 30 tales, 27 heads in the 57 super bowls.
*  Uh, it won last year.
*  Tales, right?
*  Remember Sirianni was sobbing or maybe that was the anthem.
*  I'm not sure.
*  Coin toss or the anthem, but Simmons, you and I established last week that
*  we believe in momentum and that's how Purdy was able to come back against the
*  lions.
*  I believe in the momentum of tales.
*  I'm going tails minus one Oh four.
*  Why?
*  There's tales.
*  No, I did.
*  Minus one Oh four.
*  They just get a 4% vague either way.
*  That's right.
*  That's right.
*  Okay.
*  You want to go, uh, you want, we want, uh, alternate.
*  Can we go a little earlier than the coin toss?
*  Oh yeah, sure.
*  So Reba McIntyre right now it's 86 seconds and that might go up and
*  there's some juice on that.
*  It's minus one 45 minus one 50 range, which seems super fast.
*  Cause we've had, we've had overrunners that are for this that have gone over
*  two minutes one year.
*  We had, uh, um, our buddy PR, Maven Lewis K was in the stadium and tipped us off
*  and then was like, don't talk about this on the podcast.
*  I might get in trouble.
*  And then we immediately did.
*  What was it?
*  Do you remember what anthem that was?
*  I don't know.
*  I think he was right.
*  I think he gave us a winner.
*  So they try to lock these down, but, um, what you said a minute 26, a minute 26.
*  So, well, so here's the last six Stapleton, Stapleton two Oh five.
*  That went under Mickey Guyton.
*  One 35 went over Jasmine Sullivan, Eric church.
*  One 59 over Demi Lovato.
*  One 55 under Gladys Knight, one 47 over.
*  And then pink was two minutes under.
*  So this is the shortest over under we've had in a while.
*  And I like the other cell.
*  You could go back even more.
*  I'm not, I'm looking at the list of in 30 years and 20 years, 140 Billy Joel, Carrie
*  Underwood, Kelly Clarkson, 2012 was one 34.
*  That was the shortest.
*  Wow.
*  You think, you think Reba, I mean, she probably put some action on herself.
*  Have we had a national anthem betting scandal yet?
*  No, the easiest thing to rig.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know what we got to find out what her plans are afterwards.
*  Why she's trying to get the hell out of there.
*  So could she part, could she parlay herself?
*  Yeah.
*  And she's just like, oh,
*  like flying through it.
*  She's, you know, six lines.
*  All right.
*  Oh, and speaking of a music thing, Usher, one of the props was, was him playing.
*  Yeah.
*  As plus 200 as the favorite for opening song, just coming out with that one.
*  I like the plus odds.
*  You like the plus odds.
*  Yeah.
*  I like the plus odds.
*  I like the plus odds.
*  I like the plus odds.
*  I like the plus odds.
*  I like the plus odds.
*  I like the plus odds.
*  I like the plus odds.
*  You like for that one.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Cause he comes out as like, yeah, yeah.
*  Everybody's like, yeah.
*  Let dancers things coming around.
*  I like it.
*  You can't disagree with.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, the opposite is no, I kind of mood.
*  There's one 14 to one odds.
*  Jim dance mistakes.
*  Usher for John legend and is immediately canceled.
*  So that, I don't know.
*  Does Fandle have that?
*  I'm not sure.
*  That's not John legend, Jim.
*  That's not sure.
*  Jim, you want me to take that back?
*  Jim, Jim, rush to judgment there, Jim.
*  All right.
*  What do you got?
*  You're up.
*  All right.
*  I'm going to give you one though.
*  These odds aren't that great.
*  I'm going to give you a two or three, but they hit the prime.
*  I love any player to score two or more touchdowns minus one 65.
*  Again, you're not, I'm not doing any favors with the big, but last year
*  hurts had three Higgins and cup both had to the year before Gronk the year
*  before that had to Damian Williams had to for the chiefs, the last time
*  they beat the Niners Gronk again versus the Eagles, James White, two or more.
*  I mean, uh, two or more touchdowns by a player in six to the last seven
*  and between Kelsey and CMC and Samuel, Kittle and I, that's a lot of nice options.
*  I just feel like quarterbacks.
*  I want to rock the boat.
*  If something's working in this game where there's a bundle of nerves
*  surrounding the participants.
*  So I like that.
*  That's a really good one.
*  Cause I like it.
*  Uh, all right.
*  I'm going to go big on this one.
*  I like it.
*  Like with a big player here, my home's under 262.5 pass yards.
*  Ooh.
*  His last five weeks, 242, 215, 262, 245, 235 since week nine, three of 12
*  games over two 62, and I also think they've changed how they played.
*  Like, I really think they want long drives, shorter games, move down the field.
*  I think that Vegas game when that game was so embarrassing and they had some sort
*  of come to Jesus moment and since then they just want these seven minute drives.
*  They want to shorten the game.
*  Um, they just feel like they can win any 21 17, you know, 20 17, 24 to 20,
*  like just anything in that range.
*  And I don't, I don't see him airing it out.
*  What's like, what's the best case scenario for Kelsey?
*  Probably what did last week.
*  It's like 11 catches for a hundred rice had a really good game too.
*  And he still didn't get there.
*  So the only thing that worries me is McKinnon's back, which is a better, you
*  know, third down pass guy for him.
*  And you could always get the one long pass that would F this up, but, um, I
*  just don't see him chucking around.
*  I think they're going to have long drives.
*  I love this.
*  Um, every year his air yards go down and down and down, and it doesn't mean he's
*  worse.
*  I love this.
*  I'm going to put two stars by this because I think people will bet this over,
*  just be like, Oh, my homes, I want to bet over.
*  I want to bet my home's this and my home's that, but I think it comes in under,
*  you're right.
*  They play a different game and they, you're really going to have to take them out of
*  their game plan to hit two 63 or more.
*  I think they'd have to be losing by 10 or more.
*  I just don't see that in the second quarter.
*  Otherwise you're right.
*  Just short stuff over the middle screen plays.
*  My home's doing what he's doing.
*  Or the game goes to overtime and you get screwed that way.
*  I went to the Knicks Lakers game with Dave Jacoby, who loves using Fandel and he's,
*  he's all excited.
*  He's like LeBron 25 points over that with the Lakers.
*  And I'm like, I don't like it.
*  Seems too easy.
*  Right.
*  Everyone here who's betting that like the instinct is to always go over.
*  I'm with you, my homes.
*  This is two 62.5 now.
*  It's probably like two 65 by game time.
*  Yeah.
*  And at that point they're going to have to be behind by 10, 14 points for him to
*  hit that.
*  So yeah, they're not, they're not game planning for 280 yard game for him.
*  I agree with that.
*  All right.
*  I'll give you one again.
*  I'll be done with these bad odds in a second, but shortest touchdown under one
*  and a half yards.
*  I love this all year.
*  They only seem to have it up for like the super bowl.
*  It's minus one 75.
*  It should be about minus two 50.
*  This is the brother Bryce special.
*  It's at four straight.
*  It's at seven of the last eight.
*  Same thinking here.
*  CMC, everything down low for the chiefs shovel pass or Pacheco Pacheco himself as
*  five, one yard touchdown runs this year.
*  And you know, if you're a chiefs, they're only going to win because of Taylor
*  Swift conspiracists.
*  You believe that there's going to be a phantom pass interference call in the end
*  zone, which automatically puts the ball at the one.
*  I think this should be like two 50.
*  It's one 75.
*  So the, I really liked that one.
*  The only thing that worries me, my homes just doesn't score touchdowns anymore.
*  Right.
*  I don't think he has a touchdown this year.
*  Is that possible?
*  I think he has zero touchdowns because you know, they're never going to have him
*  do tush push any of that stuff.
*  Cause he got hurt in that play.
*  They basically retired that play.
*  Um, I'm looking at this, looking this up as we talking.
*  Yeah.
*  Zero touchdowns this year for him.
*  And then purdy isn't exactly a tush pusher either.
*  So you're looking at Pacheco McCaffrey, but the good news with this is any
*  pass interference in the end zone and the ball gets put on the one and we've
*  seen Pacheco and McCaffrey can go in.
*  How do you say it?
*  People saying I say Pacheco wrong.
*  You say Pacheco.
*  Oh, that's Pacheco.
*  Yeah.
*  You say it right.
*  I'm being told.
*  I say it wrong.
*  What do I say?
*  Pacheco.
*  I think I say like a Y.
*  Yeah.
*  Pacheco.
*  You make them sound like Sicilian.
*  Check on check.
*  Check.
*  Okay.
*  Check.
*  Oh, what are you speaking of?
*  Speaking of quarterbacks and running stuff.
*  Brock Purdy over three and a half rushing attempts plus one 24 on Fandol.
*  And maybe people have bet that since we're talking about this in the playoffs.
*  It five carries.
*  He had six carries during the season in the since he gave me at six Tampa, he
*  had four in Minnesota at five in general against a good defense where they're
*  pushing the pocket and he had say that was one of the keys to that Lions game
*  was his ability to move around.
*  I think he's able to do this against the chiefs.
*  We've seen quarterbacks with their legs, beat them for first downs.
*  And I just think he's going to run the ball four times.
*  So I was surprised that was plus one 24.
*  I would have thought that would have been like minus one 50.
*  I'm going to put two stars by it and I'll make you feel slightly better.
*  I think this is a, this is a nice hedge.
*  If you like the chiefs, because a kneel down counts as a carry.
*  So if he takes three knees, you're getting, you're half away right there.
*  You know what I forgot when I was researching this, that my homes, he had
*  hit the over and the rushing, they were running the clock out at the end and he
*  he lost 16 yards on three carries, trying to run out the car.
*  It was one of the great prop losses.
*  Our friend, Nick Santora had that and was devastated.
*  I watched the game with him and he lost on that because of that.
*  And he fled the state.
*  He's not, he has not come back actually moved to Pennsylvania.
*  He's he's, he was supposed to make his seventh action show for Netflix.
*  That's right.
*  He's like, no, I can't do it.
*  Jason Statham's like, wait, I thought we're shooting on Monday.
*  What do you, what do you have for your next one?
*  Uh, all right.
*  How about this first touchdown Jersey?
*  I love these.
*  I just love it all.
*  First touchdown Jersey number over 19 and a half.
*  So Debo is the cutoff.
*  Uh, I like over you get Kelsey, you get McCaffrey, you get kiddle, you get rice,
*  get most of the receivers over 19 and a half, you go under, you get the
*  quarterbacks, you get IU and you get Debo.
*  Did I miss somebody?
*  And Pacheco, however you say it.
*  You like these bets where I actually have to do work to follow what's
*  happening with the bet.
*  Like I've watched, I've watched huge football games with you.
*  You can barely concentrate on anything.
*  What's the games going?
*  So you're going to be, you're being calculated in this as it's happening.
*  I'm thinking of bringing my, uh, my son, Jack's math tutor in with me to watch
*  the games, Superbowl Sunday, because I just have too much or an accountant or
*  something.
*  All right, Sal, this is it.
*  My favorite prop.
*  You're going to do Gary Russell later.
*  I'm doing mine now.
*  Okay.
*  I, this might be a little bit on Gary Russell's corner and if it is, I
*  apologize.
*  That wasn't my intention.
*  I just really liked this bet.
*  First TD of the game, Noah Gray.
*  Okay.
*  43 to one.
*  He caught two short touchdowns in 2023.
*  He had 28 catches for 305 for the year.
*  He's 16 first down catches.
*  And in general, when the chiefs get close to the, again, my homes isn't going
*  to run because they, they just don't, that plays out my homes doing anything,
*  running into the line, push, push, push anything.
*  And then it's like, well, they're going to, he'll throw it to Kelsey then.
*  Now the Noah Gray, it's like the Superbowl was like when they love to have the
*  cute play where it's like, Oh, you thought I was going to do this.
*  We did this instead.
*  And all of a sudden, Noah Gray gets the first TD and everybody's like, who the
*  fuck is that?
*  Right.
*  43 to one.
*  That's a, that's a large number and it's the perfect name to piss everybody off.
*  It's like, Oh man, just complete just hostility.
*  Fandal rakes in the IU.
*  Kelsey.
*  Yeah.
*  Thank you.
*  I'm good.
*  I'm good.
*  Yeah.
*  All right.
*  I don't hate that.
*  That's too high.
*  43 to one.
*  That's too high.
*  Um, I have, uh, let's see.
*  Uh, okay.
*  I have, all right, let's do Gatorade.
*  Why not?
*  Yellow lime green, uh, plus three 80 purple is favored at plus two 25.
*  Yellow green is three to one.
*  Um, yeah, I'm getting into three to one.
*  Everyone bet big on purple last time these teams played because of Kobe.
*  Um, in 57, it was purple.
*  There were two blues before that yellow hit with Doug Peterson and the Eagles.
*  I think yellow is due also if drunk Jason Kelsey urinates in the bucket, you
*  automatically get the win for yellow.
*  So that's what I'm going to.
*  So what would be the va what would be the Vegas ties to the color?
*  Oh, right.
*  Why didn't I even think of that?
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't even know what you would associate from a color standpoint.
*  The bowl, that logo that was supposed to trip everyone up for Raven's, um,
*  Niners was purple a little bit, right?
*  Purple and red.
*  So there you go.
*  I don't know.
*  I'm just saying, uh, green right there.
*  I love that you bet on, do we have, so for my next one, I couldn't find this
*  yet and maybe it's not out, but.
*  Is there a Jake Moody will miss a field goal prop?
*  Um, I didn't see that either.
*  I was looking for that there.
*  There will be that will be.
*  I'd like to go blind, just blind, blind.
*  I don't know the odds yet blind on a parlay of Jake Moody misses a, a field
*  goal and it's probably a little longer, but it goes over the upright and it seems
*  like he missed it, but we're not positive.
*  Ooh.
*  Parlayed with Adam Corolla and babbling about how the upright should be taller
*  for the next 25 minutes to a bunch of people who have to move to different
*  sections to get away from them, even though he's probably hosting the party.
*  So I have the parlay.
*  Well, I don't, I can't calculate those odds yet, but I think that Jake Moody
*  misses it's quite a Corolla for 12, 13 minutes straight, 12, 13 podcast straight.
*  Corolla wouldn't be happy if the uprights went.
*  Through the moon, through the surface of the moon, he wouldn't be, it's not
*  not enough for him.
*  I do.
*  I found odds for the miss.
*  What do you think they are?
*  What is it?
*  I'm going to say plus one 20.
*  Oh, you're going to love this plus two 10.
*  Oh my God.
*  That guy, he's not ready.
*  That's, that's one of my favorite ones, but you lose if there's no attempt.
*  That that's the only thing.
*  So he has to actually, he actually, I assume this, you know, I don't think that
*  guy that that is one of the Achilles heels of this diners team.
*  Right.
*  I don't trust he's one of those when he comes out, I never think he's making it.
*  So that would be a fun one.
*  Plus two 10.
*  Yeah, that's good.
*  All right.
*  I'm writing it down.
*  All right.
*  What do you got?
*  Plus two 10.
*  Uh, I also, uh, off of the Gatorade color of Brock Purdy's mom's minivan.
*  When she picks them up after the game, red two to one green four to one clear nine
*  to one, I don't know why it clears even in there.
*  Um, no, they may clear minivans.
*  Isn't that strange?
*  Why is it take me through this?
*  Will the two minute warning come at exactly two minutes?
*  The no is plus three 10.
*  So that would be there running a play that goes over the two minute and the
*  clock stops at 58, 157 versus counting the clock down in the two minute warning.
*  And then it just stops at two minutes.
*  Okay.
*  So let me, here's the thing.
*  Uh, it's one of those plays where 49ers have it like at their own 45 and they
*  know they could, they have no timeouts, but they know they could throw here
*  because the clock is going to stop.
*  Stop.
*  Right.
*  And so it's at two Oh three and they take it to one fifth.
*  I don't know.
*  I just thought that was too high for the nut for the note.
*  Probably off anyway.
*  Um, yeah.
*  So does that mean I'm up?
*  Yeah, go ahead.
*  Yep.
*  All right.
*  I wrote a name track, Excel it today from New York city to Boston.
*  I had a great time.
*  It was great to fly by Stanford and New Haven and new London and
*  Providence, uh, seeing the sites really brought me back to my, uh, my childhood.
*  One of the things I did on this train ride was try to figure out the longest
*  reception and the instinct is to take like IU, he's the favorite, you know, and
*  his big receptions this year were 42, 76, 51, and then he had a 51 yarder in the
*  playoffs that bounced off a guy's face.
*  Yes.
*  Um, you might say rice rice has had a couple of long ones over the years,
*  over the months, but the one I settled on with great odds.
*  And I love this for so many different reasons is Valdez scantling longest
*  perception of the game plus 800.
*  Yeah.
*  This year he's had 47, 36, 34, and then the playoffs is at 32 and 32.
*  We've also seen him drop a couple of long ass ones that he became like,
*  uh, you know, the enemy of the chiefs fans.
*  Right.
*  If we're talking redemption, redemption stories and just like, Oh, think of all
*  that if a chiefs win, what are, what are some of the things that'll happen?
*  And he's already made a couple of big plays in the playoffs, but Valdez scantling
*  with like a 60 yarder or a 65 yarder or 50 yarder, I just like the odds.
*  I think he has as good of a chance as IU to bust one and the chiefs aren't
*  giving up long, they didn't do it against Buffalo and they didn't do it against
*  Baltimore, except for that Wednesday flowers play.
*  Um, so did he have the longest?
*  Did he have the longest, um, last game?
*  Is this was 32?
*  Like you said, Oh no, I think somebody on Baltimore beat him.
*  Yeah.
*  Flowers at a 54.
*  How did that happen?
*  She's yeah, that's right.
*  I don't know.
*  Uh, yeah, I think so.
*  I think he's kind of like the guy who's like, he's the wrestler that's hiding
*  under the ring, uh, during the Royal rumble.
*  And then he comes out, he's like, wait a minute.
*  I didn't know you were still in there.
*  That's much like he did against the Ravens.
*  It was a long one, but it wasn't the longest.
*  I like that.
*  I think that's too high.
*  They will throw to him that the script would have him catch one.
*  One other one for this one that I thought was intriguing was McCaffrey was 18 to one
*  his longest this year, 35, 33 and 41 during the season.
*  Then he had a 28 yard in the playoffs.
*  But I was thinking like some like 71 yard wheel route, right?
*  Where it's just like, Oh, and he's in space and all of a sudden he's just gone.
*  Cause he's busted some big plays, but usually they're runs.
*  What was one of those odds?
*  What were those?
*  Eight, 18 to one.
*  It just seemed like too high, right?
*  All right.
*  There's too many bets.
*  These can all win, right?
*  We should warn people that aren't going to all win.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  It's good to take some unders too.
*  Uh, all right.
*  Well, I'll, I'll throw it at you.
*  Purdy interception for all the reasons you brought up at the top of the podcast.
*  Right.
*  It's only minus one 15th.
*  Um, he's at, he's at seven in the last eight games, somehow none versus the Packers a
*  few weeks ago, even though he could add like three or four nerves could easily set in.
*  Right.
*  I also like Carl.
*  Wait, can you hold on on that one?
*  Yeah, go ahead.
*  But no, but this is a similar thing to it, but I had it down as well.
*  He 11 picks this season, but I watched a lot of Niners this year, at least seven,
*  eight drop picks for him.
*  It only two had more dropped picks this season of games that I watched.
*  So I just, I'm with you.
*  I think that mine, there's another bet.
*  The words just chiefs get the first interception is minus one 10.
*  I don't know why we wouldn't.
*  Oh, that's a good one.
*  That's a good one.
*  I'm just going to add to that cart.
*  These guys are linemen, but defensive linemen, what Carl Laftis, 100 to one, Chris
*  Jones, 70 to one to get an interception.
*  They don't post, they don't accumulate a lot of picks, but can't you see a bad
*  it up at the, at the line of scrimmage, especially if he's going to let the pocket
*  collapse like he did in the first half in the last two games.
*  So, uh,
*  the screen pass or somebody jumps off.
*  Right.
*  Yep.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  All right.
*  Here's another one.
*  I really like the chiefs will have the longest kick return is minus one 60.
*  And the reason for this one is buck her.
*  The chief's kicker is like pretty touchback reliant.
*  He just boots in the end zone and you don't return it.
*  Whereas Moody, you know, especially if he loses confidence, misses a
*  field goal, doesn't hit one.
*  I just think the chiefs will have more chances to have kick returns.
*  So that that's minus one 60.
*  I don't love the odds, but I like the.
*  I like that a lot.
*  I have something later to support that.
*  I'll say this though.
*  I know this, the odds suck for this, but Fendel has it at minus three 30.
*  Other books have it like minus 500 that the first, the kickoff, the
*  opening kickoff is a touchback.
*  I like that player takes a knee.
*  Uh, the chiefs have 83% to your point, touchbacks this year for buck.
*  Or the league average is 65, two super bowls in a row.
*  There's been a touchback in the opening kick, all the super bowl
*  touchbacks in the opening kick occurred in the dome.
*  I think this is the same story, but it's high.
*  It's three 30.
*  Your way to do that.
*  I like it.
*  Yeah, I like it.
*  Um, you're up.
*  Okay.
*  Um, all right.
*  These squares, let's talk about these squares.
*  You can go on Fandel.
*  This is perhaps the greatest invention since wireless that you could bet the
*  seven three or the three three.
*  You don't have to be stuck with these pools that with the two five or whatever.
*  Shit, the nine eight.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  The nine eight.
*  You're done.
*  Right.
*  And not to mention it's a pain collecting money.
*  You and I have been at super bowl parties.
*  You've got these dead sex, the Anthem's about to end and you're freaking out
*  because only 70 boxes are filled, you know, and it ends up being me, you,
*  Daniel and Jimmy by every box.
*  So grab your zero zeros, grab your three zeros.
*  In this case, I like seven three for both sides.
*  And this is cumulative.
*  You get plus five 50 and plus 600.
*  And it goes throughout the game throughout the, you know, not just
*  the first quarter, not just the game.
*  You get every quarter at seven three, both sides.
*  If you take them once five 50 and one 600.
*  That's a great one.
*  Just in general squares are squares are terrific.
*  Yeah.
*  If you had told us 20 years ago that we would just be able to bet on our
*  own personal squares on a website.
*  Yeah.
*  And that this would have been a thing that would have worked or in an app or
*  we didn't know what apps were in 2003, but great stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, Casey to beat San Francisco and overtime is 18 to one.
*  Ooh, Casey to win the first half and the game is plus one 90.
*  And Fandol allows you to throw that in same game parlays and stuff.
*  But my thing is if Casey's going to win the game, it's going to look like that
*  Raven's game and they're going to be putting all of the silverware into the
*  sink in that first half the way they did and try to put purty on his heels.
*  And basically the same premise of what they did to Lamar.
*  Oh, you're going against Patrick, the homes.
*  Now you're down seven and we have the ball to start the second.
*  You just know how it goes.
*  But anyway, uh, Casey to win the first half in the game.
*  I think you're right.
*  That's the more logical way to approach it.
*  I feel like I owe this bet something because it's hit for me so many times.
*  Niners first half Casey game is eight to one.
*  Casey first half Niners game is seven to one.
*  They did it last week, Kansas, San Francisco.
*  So it's been a crazy year, but I think your way, uh, just that it keeps going.
*  Um, uh, 17 to one, this is interesting that the confetti that falls from
*  Allegiant stadium following the game is made from shredded call girl pamphlets.
*  I didn't even think that was allowed, but you think they'd be on top of that.
*  Uh, all right now, here's a good one.
*  Kelsey, Kelsey catches every target plus nine 50.
*  I saw that one.
*  He did almost did this last week, right?
*  He did it.
*  He did do it last week.
*  He was 11, 11 for 11.
*  He did it earlier in the year.
*  Um, you know, he's done it twice this year and fewer than 19 games.
*  So plus nine 50 is good.
*  He might just be one of those things where he's just sure-handed, wide open,
*  short routes, and God forbid if he catches one pass and goes out with an
*  injury, you win, you win that way too.
*  That's pretty good.
*  I looked at that hard.
*  I kept thinking of Fred Warner, like getting his hand in on one of them though.
*  Like he goes eight for eight and then Fred Warner, like, Oh, Fred Warner,
*  you killed us.
*  No successful fourth down conversion in the game.
*  Oh, plus 300 did some recon on this.
*  I think as I was passing through new London, I think I was looking this stuff up.
*  Um, Casey for the season, only 10, 10 for, uh, 10 for, uh, 10 for,
*  10, uh, they've had 20 total.
*  They've made 10, they're 50%.
*  Which is weird.
*  That's basically like one a game.
*  Like there's some teams that are like in the fifties, they're two, two out of
*  three in the playoffs, San Francisco for the season, 13 total, they hit seven.
*  Yeah.
*  And the playoffs are all for one.
*  Both of these teams are really conservative and I don't really fully understand it.
*  Yeah.
*  Because you would think like they're both that both have a Kansas City as a
*  Kansas City as an explosive quarterback.
*  The Niners have an explosive offense.
*  I just, I was really surprised by that.
*  Anyway, plus 300 where it seems like that should be even odds.
*  I like that.
*  And you're right.
*  I think the parlay kid went over that and against all odds, he was shocked at how
*  few four down conversions the Niners had this year.
*  Um, the one thing I'll say is I think I liked that bet better two weeks ago or
*  three weeks ago, but they're explosive, the offense, but they are have a kicker.
*  That's exploding too.
*  His mind is exploding.
*  So they might go for it on fourth and three, but they normally wouldn't.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, what do you got?
*  Just, uh, this is dumb, but exact points scored for Kansas City.
*  17 is 10 to one that hit four times this year.
*  27 is 12 to one that hit three times this year.
*  It's again, it's another way of doing like squares and stuff, but, uh, we're
*  really, we're playing craps here, right?
*  We're just throwing a million things in the middle, bet the, yo, bet everything,
*  but, uh, it kind of is the last game.
*  So we've got to do it.
*  All right.
*  So let's do MVP first.
*  I had the odds that jumped out to me where Kelsey at 17 to one and going to narratives
*  and just what's the Hollywood ending here is Kelsey winning the MVP and kissing
*  Taylor Swift at the end of the game.
*  He also, I don't think he's looked at good, especially in the second half of the
*  season, um, but in the playoffs, there's been a little bit of a resurgence and I
*  thought, I thought he was lights out last week against Baltimore.
*  So cup won the MVP, Julie Nettleman won it and San Antonio homes won it.
*  Those were the last three receivers slash Titanic.
*  Kelsey's really receiver, uh, that have won in the last 15 years, but the 17 to
*  one, I w I was really surprised the odds were that high.
*  Well, we gave this out.
*  If my home's isn't going to win it, if my home's isn't going to win it,
*  Kelsey's going to win it.
*  And if you think the chiefs are going to win, it's either my homes or Kelsey.
*  So why is Kelsey 17 to one?
*  I, he was 23 to one last week when we liked it.
*  And now, uh, I think we changed, we moved the line on people.
*  I apologize for that, but it still seems too high.
*  I'm with you.
*  I'm with you.
*  It's, um, he, uh, cause all right.
*  So I'm trying to think like if my home's has four touchdowns and Kelsey has two
*  of them, who do you think they give it to?
*  I guess it depends which ones are important towards the game.
*  Right.
*  What if it's a, what if it's a 21 to 20, 21, 17, 23 to 17 type game?
*  Kelsey has the only two touchdown catches.
*  Kelsey has eight first down catches.
*  He finishes 10 for one 32.
*  Nobody else in the chiefs has more than, you know, 40 yards receiving and, you
*  know, maybe my home stores a pick.
*  There's a path.
*  Let me ask you this.
*  The fact that my home's won the two times that they were Superbowl champs.
*  Does that make you think, all right, there's a little fatigue.
*  He doesn't have to be a three time winner.
*  Or, I mean, I'm trying to look, I'm looking at his numbers.
*  He w he had 182 yards passing last year and won it.
*  He did have three touchdowns.
*  It's just like if, if he has a typical my home's game, it's going to be 250
*  yards, two touchdowns, just this version of my home's we're watching now.
*  And then he'll get five for 42 rushing yards, something like that.
*  There's one more.
*  Yeah.
*  One more.
*  Well, I bet I really like, let me do, let me do the MVP real quick.
*  Cause I have it.
*  I just, uh, yeah, no, it's all right.
*  I envy take the 17 to one for sure.
*  That's a better number, but MVP other than quarterback is plus 200.
*  That's so that's any other position.
*  The last 10, there's been six quarterbacks and four non-quarterback.
*  So plus 200 is a decent number.
*  If you look at the last decade, McCaffrey Kelsey could burst out, you know,
*  defense, which has happened fairly recently.
*  Who knows?
*  So I like that number.
*  Well, speaking of Kelsey, him to have the most receptions in the game is plus 170.
*  And I was looking at it because pass it, maybe, maybe the Rhode Island
*  border at this point, Kelsey had eight plus catches four times this season.
*  Rice had eight plus four times.
*  Kittles had eight plus twice.
*  Iukes only had it once and McCaffrey and Debo zero times, which made me think
*  races plus two 20 for most receptions.
*  Kelsey's plus one 70.
*  You could almost bet both.
*  And just say, you bet a hundred on either on both of them.
*  You either win 70, 120, or you lose 200 if George Kittle ends up
*  having the most catches, right?
*  So I think it's going to be Kelsey or rice and the Kelsey plus one 70.
*  I'm actually surprised.
*  That's not like even odds.
*  I think it's going to be even odds.
*  I think it's going to get there.
*  You know, as we're talking this through, is Kelsey going to be the most bet on
*  non-quarterback in Superbowl history?
*  We just talked about eight Kelsey bets.
*  That all sounds great.
*  Well, remember we had this two years ago with Cooper Cup and I think just about
*  all of them hit and they threw them over and over and over again as the game went on.
*  So, you know, if you think the chiefs are going to win, Kelsey is going
*  to have to have a good game.
*  There's no other path.
*  But how many 13 year olds are asking their dad to put $20 on Kelsey to
*  score first or Kelsey to win MVP?
*  I don't think we've ever, there's no other way to win.
*  I think 65.
*  You're probably right.
*  I might be wrong.
*  You don't think this is happening for Brandon LaFell 10 years ago in the Patriots?
*  Well, you also have the segment of the country now that hates Kelsey and Taylor
*  Swift and every time he gets a catch, ah, screw that guy.
*  Exactly.
*  So he's, he's the most eyeballs on him of any non QB we've had in a long time.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  And I think that's the biggest thing.
*  I think that's the biggest thing.
*  I mean, no Patriot, no non QB Patriot ever ascended to these, to these kind
*  of visibility fame heights, um, Randy boss.
*  I don't even know if he got there.
*  No Jerry, right.
*  I mean, that was so, this is real.
*  So we have to really consider just the last 15 years or so.
*  Um, it lasts 25.
*  It's like no Steeler, no Packer, no cowboy.
*  What are you?
*  You're right.
*  You have made it.
*  You have made it.
*  You're right.
*  You're right.
*  No, I don't know.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's, it's, you know, manning, it wouldn't be a, it wouldn't be a
*  Steeler, like you said, saints, Ravens, Seahawks.
*  I don't even know.
*  Is it a Terrell Davis?
*  I'm not sure it was close.
*  He's, he's absolutely outrageously ridiculously famous and you can make a
*  case he's more famous than my homes right now.
*  The Taylor thing has anyway, we don't have to rehash it.
*  All right.
*  What do you want to do?
*  Gary Russell?
*  I have a couple others.
*  I have a two to one odds sometime this week.
*  Dan Campbell spotted at a blackjack table, splitting tens.
*  I could see that.
*  I think that's probably good money there.
*  Spitting tens against the days.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, what, uh, 25 to one following the game, Brock Purdy holds up the
*  Lombardi Trophy and screams into the camera.
*  Can you smell what the Brock is cooking?
*  I can smell it.
*  I can smell it.
*  I can smell it.
*  I can smell it.
*  I can smell it.
*  I can smell it.
*  I can smell it.
*  I can smell it.
*  I can smell it.
*  Brock is cooking.
*  That would be interesting.
*  That's all I got.
*  It's a little nonsense.
*  I could, uh,
*  I wish there was a way to bet on the CBS when they do the thing, like Brock
*  Purdy's journey for Mr.
*  Relevant and they spent three days making that cartoon package where he's like
*  wearing a cowboy hat riding a horse and he's riding next to Trey Lance's horse.
*  And then Trey Lance's horse falls off a cliff.
*  Interesting.
*  They spent like $50,000 on the stupid cartoon.
*  Lance has to narrate it.
*  And then look at him ride in there, Tony.
*  He's riding in Jim.
*  It's friend, the horse.
*  And then someone at the end, they have the graphic is buried in a Vegas, uh, desert.
*  Um, like Tommy DeVito's agent.
*  All right.
*  Before we do Gary Russell, here's my favorite same game.
*  Parlay right now it is over 13 to one odds Kansas City to win first half game.
*  My home's under two 62.5.
*  We discussed Noah Gray over one and a half receptions and, and Pacheco, not
*  Pacheco, Pacheco 70 plus yards rushing.
*  And that is 13 plus 13 16.
*  Is it that high?
*  Yeah.
*  I didn't hear anything.
*  I didn't like, oh man.
*  Yeah.
*  So I'll do that again.
*  Casey to win first half game.
*  My home's under two 62.5.
*  No gray two catches.
*  Pacheco 70 plus rushing.
*  All right.
*  I don't have one.
*  That sounds good because I, well, you have the Gary Russell, which is way more important.
*  So yes, backstory.
*  It's super bowl, Steelers, whatever Steelers and Cardinals.
*  Great Superbowl.
*  Really enjoyable.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, and you did a prop.
*  We had the podcast at that point and you did a prop and it was Gary Russell.
*  What was it for, for three yards, four yards?
*  No, to not score a touchdown.
*  So this is their backup running back.
*  Right.
*  It was a fast Willie Parker was there.
*  We started right.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that year.
*  Yeah.
*  So minus one 50, uh, to not score a touchdown, the backup.
*  And this is, I think the first year I picked an obscure player to not do something.
*  Minus one 50.
*  Not only did he score the first touchdown, he had two carries inside the three yard
*  line, uh, in that first drive or the first drive that they, it was like they listened
*  to the pot and they just wanted to mess with you.
*  And then, um, Coincident, then someone wrote in and said that months later that they were
*  laughing when Gary Russell scored and across the room, this guy heard a woman laugh and
*  they got together.
*  They had never met each other and they discussed it and they go, do you listen to the
*  guests, the lines pot?
*  Like, yeah, yeah.
*  Those two ended up getting married based on the Gary Russell prop bet.
*  And he's never, we've never heard of Dave.
*  I think the woman is now dating.
*  Um, uh, I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know what she'll be.
*  She's with Kanye.
*  Is that who she's with?
*  I'll have to look that up.
*  Someone let us know.
*  But anyway, every year I try to pick an obscure name and top the Gary Russell moment.
*  So I was, I was, as you were talking there at the end, I was looking up Gary
*  Russell to see what happened to him.
*  And there's apparently a boxer named Gary Russell.
*  I know, I know.
*  I got, I got in that rabbit hole too.
*  Of a featherweight, uh, who held the title for like seven years.
*  I don't watch the featherweights.
*  Um, so yeah, that may, we probably should have put some Gary Russell's bet.
*  All right, here we go.
*  It's ready.
*  SB 58, the Gary Russell prop.
*  Here we go.
*  Okay.
*  I really thought about this because I think last year and maybe even two of the last
*  three years, the name has been so obscure.
*  They haven't even made the roster.
*  Like they were inactive by Sunday and that sucked.
*  And then everyone got mad at me and whatever, but this guy's making the roster.
*  He's playing.
*  He's actually a name that's less obscure than those that I've gone with.
*  Right.
*  I went with the, who's your tight end?
*  Uh, the Patriots is like a, um, from Samoa.
*  I think I met one with that, right.
*  I went to a bunch of them.
*  Um, I really try to go obscure.
*  Not this year.
*  Richie James returns a punt or a kick for a touchdown 30 to one odds.
*  Kansas city chiefs, 2018.
*  He had a kick return for a touchdown as a member of the 49ers.
*  So we'll hear all about that.
*  Uh, I just see it second quarter Simmons following a Jake Moody field goal that
*  grazes the crossbar and goes in much like you would describe San Francisco, feeling
*  good about themselves.
*  Richie James, former mid Tennessee state blue Raider takes a kickoff 92 yards to
*  pay dirt and that dirt is going to pay well 30 to one buddy.
*  Let's do this Gary Russell.
*  So is it Richie James?
*  It has to be a special teams TD.
*  That's right.
*  Punt or kick return.
*  I gotta say, I bet on what your Gary Russell pick was going to be.
*  And I lost.
*  You did.
*  What'd you like?
*  What'd you have?
*  I thought it was going to be Blake Blake Bell, the third string KC tight.
*  He fit your profile.
*  Yeah, I like that.
*  I've been screwed with the tight ends though.
*  The third string tight ends usually get cut before a game time, but Richie
*  James is doing it.
*  Richie James.
*  I like it.
*  So you researched all his, all his returns teams over the years.
*  Yeah, he's done it.
*  And I just think it's going to be like a weird punting kickoff situation, Moody,
*  whatever 30 to one is a good number.
*  God bless you.
*  Richie James.
*  Where does this line end?
*  Where do we, where does, where are we at on a week from now?
*  I think two, I think two, I don't know why.
*  I think sharp money will come in on two.
*  I mean, they are giving it to us with the teaser, aren't they?
*  Like we're going to get eight, eight and a half at this point.
*  And you just, I think it has to one and a half.
*  One and a half.
*  Yeah.
*  So your big bet is going to be Casey and the over on a teaser.
*  No, my big bet is going to probably be Casey and the under really.
*  Cause the under goes all the way up to 53 and a half.
*  And if the working theory is that the chiefs are either going to win or hang
*  around, it'll be a slow pace game.
*  And 53 and a half is a lot, man.
*  27, 24 is a lot of scoring for these teams that take forever to get down.
*  50, 54 is like 30 to 24 or, you know, 30, 27.
*  So somebody's getting to 30 at 54.
*  Yeah.
*  So like 28, 27 beats it.
*  But it would, it would basically have to be 30.
