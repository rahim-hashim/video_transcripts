# Million-Dollar Picks Week 8 With Sheil Kapadia and Anthony Dabbundo  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [October 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucidMnn35Ec)
*  All right. We're going to do some million dollar picks.
*  We have all the ringers in town this week.
*  So I grabbed Shil Kapadia, Anthony De Bundeau.
*  They're doing this with me in person.
*  And I'm super happy that you're here because this is the toughest week of the year.
*  The lines are super weird.
*  They're like old school high lines, huge home dogs.
*  There's teams that I feel like we've either given up on or we're too bullish on.
*  And it has all the makings of a zigzag week.
*  And I'm scared.
*  And I might actually did really well on million dollar picks last week.
*  I thought we should have swept lost by the half point in Packers game.
*  And then I still don't know how the Chargers didn't beat the Cardinals.
*  But when you have a guy on the team you bet on
*  that fumbles the ball out of bounds for the touchback,
*  has that team ever then covered?
*  No, no, that's an L every time.
*  Yeah, that's an L every time.
*  You just immediately know it's like a black cat gets thrown on the TV.
*  What are you the most afraid of from this week?
*  I think you said it, the big lines.
*  You have the Lions.
*  I'm like the Lions are awesome.
*  The Lions can get to the Super Bowl.
*  They're 11 and a half point favorites.
*  I'm looking at the Panthers who Andy Dalton gets in the car accident.
*  Bryce Young is back.
*  I'm like, do I want to take Bo Nicks to cover 10 and a half points?
*  So those two lines-
*  Can the Broncos score 10 points?
*  Yeah.
*  Ravens, Browns.
*  20 on Carolina by halftime though.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  So the big lines are the scariest.
*  What are you the most scared of?
*  The bad teams are worse than they've been in years according to DVOA.
*  That's scary.
*  Road favorites are 16 and 2 in the last three weeks.
*  Wow.
*  It should have been 17 and 1 if the Chargers beat the Cardinals, right?
*  Jalen Rigger elevated from the practice squad to ruin the game.
*  Unbelievable.
*  So you're the most scared of that?
*  Things never last forever.
*  NFL not for long.
*  So I feel like there has to be some mean reversion.
*  The first four weeks I came on the pod, we talked about it.
*  Underdogs were crushing it.
*  And now the spreads are really, really big.
*  There's six games with at least a touchdown spread.
*  And I don't, there's a couple I like and a couple I want no part of.
*  So I'll walk you through a couple of the games that I ultimately decided to stay away from
*  before we get to the ones I liked.
*  And then I want to hear what you guys like.
*  I was looking at the Seahawks all week plus three against Buffalo because
*  I still feel like you can throw on Buffalo.
*  And that's the one thing I really believe Seattle can do.
*  And I actually think their offense might be a little better than people realize.
*  And then ultimately Metcalf being hurt, not knowing what's happening with him.
*  And then I realized like, I just hate betting against Josh Allen.
*  I just don't like it.
*  You just feel so stupid with.
*  And so I was like, I think I'm out, but you guys could also talk me back into that.
*  I like the other side quite a bit.
*  I like the Bills minus three is one of my favorite picks of the week.
*  I'm looking at it.
*  That Seahawks team last week against the worst pass rush in the NFL in Atlanta.
*  Geno Smith was pressured on 50% of his drop backs.
*  Now we played awesome.
*  He's able to play under pressure and he did that in that game and they won.
*  But the Bills defense is overachieved this year.
*  I mean, they've got a good pass rush.
*  Their offense is top five in the NFL against that Seahawks defense that has not been great.
*  I feel like the Seahawks, I don't want to call them the good bad team,
*  but I do feel like they're that if you lose to the Seahawks, you probably stink.
*  But against good teams, they played what the 49ers, the Lions,
*  those have both been double digit losses this year.
*  I think the Bills are really good actually with that Amari Cooper edition.
*  He played well last week and so in kind of a three point spread.
*  They can run the ball.
*  Their offensive line is good.
*  So I like the Bills minus three in that game.
*  You think the Colts are the good bad team or would you go with the Seattle?
*  Are they good enough?
*  You're he's the Colts guy.
*  Are they good enough to be the good bad team?
*  Maybe.
*  They're the coin flip every game team.
*  Every game just decided in the last five minutes this year.
*  Yeah, I was looking at their point for every game and every game was like two points,
*  three points, six points.
*  Yeah.
*  Yes.
*  I mean, the Colts, I think the Seahawks are better than the Colts.
*  I think the Seahawks will surprise some teams, but they're not healthy.
*  They're not good on the offensive line.
*  And it's like if Gino turns into a magician and has one of those games
*  against a bad defense, they can win.
*  But I think if I see a team that I think can get to the Super Bowl playing the Seahawks,
*  I feel pretty good about that team taking care of them.
*  Any other Seahawks thoughts?
*  Buffalo has been running the ball a lot all year until last week.
*  They actually got more pass happy for the first time.
*  And it is interesting to me because they have now more options with Cooper in the lineup
*  to throw.
*  And the one concerning thing with me for Buffalo is it's always been that they play the two high.
*  They never give up big plays.
*  This year they are giving up more big plays.
*  And so I do kind of think Seattle could stay in this with some explosives if they had Metcalf.
*  But without him, who's the explosive threat on this offense now?
*  Seattle, 27th against the run, their defense.
*  Feels like Buffalo can run on them.
*  Yeah, they should.
*  If Metcalf was playing, I'd be a little more bullish on Seattle.
*  But yeah, so that was one.
*  I guess we got to talk Packers-Jags.
*  I can't believe the Jags are even in the conversation.
*  But this line is offensive.
*  I mean, the Packers are four and a half point favorites in Jacksonville.
*  It's probably going to be hot.
*  The Jaguars are probably going to be able to move the ball on them, I'm guessing.
*  And then conversely, I haven't liked the way Jordan Loves looked.
*  I like that Packers team, but they have a big game next week.
*  Coming off, they had a big game last week.
*  This just feels so trappy to me.
*  I know who Big Bang Dog likes.
*  Yeah, we're going to go to Jacksonville and beat the shit out of them.
*  And it just scares me.
*  Somebody who likes to kind of follow where does the lines move on certain teams throughout the year?
*  Because you'll see that big groups, people with a lot of market influence,
*  they will bet certain teams repeatedly throughout the year.
*  And there's no team in the NFL that has gotten more of that support than the Jags.
*  If you look at the spreads, week three, week four, week five, week six,
*  somebody has come in and said, we love Jacksonville.
*  I don't know who they are.
*  If they are, if you're betting Jacksonville every week and you listen to this podcast, call me.
*  We can talk about what you see that I don't.
*  But Green Bay has some real red flags.
*  Well, talk about them.
*  Give us three.
*  So their early down numbers are terrible.
*  Their success rate numbers are very mediocre.
*  It's a very boomer bus team and they forced a ton of turnovers.
*  They've had a ton of explosives.
*  That's good.
*  But how sustainable is it is a question that I have about Green Bay.
*  This would be a stay away from me.
*  We've had interventions on this podcast about the Jaguars before.
*  I'm not doing it against Matt LaFleur who wins 70% of his games or whatever it is.
*  And you're right about Jordan Love.
*  But we saw him the second half of last year.
*  There was some boomer bus to him and then he put it together and he was sensational.
*  I think that stretch is coming.
*  If you're looking at sleeper MVP candidates,
*  I think Jordan Love has like a seven, eight game stretch coming up
*  where he's going to be one of the best players in one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL.
*  I just don't think those turnovers are going to last.
*  I can't take Jacksonville.
*  They won by what?
*  Running it 18 times in a row.
*  How often is that going to happen?
*  So I understand sort of the analytical view of-
*  They beat the soft Patriots.
*  That's right.
*  The soft Patriots.
*  I don't know that that formula is going to work against the Packers.
*  You know, you should put this in your column.
*  You write an excellent betting column for us every week.
*  Every year there's an I hate myself team where you bet them and then you just,
*  you literally hate yourself halfway through the game.
*  And that's the Jaguars this year.
*  I don't even know who's even in the running against them for that.
*  I mean, if you bet the Browns at any point this year, you probably-
*  Yeah, but that's it.
*  Yeah, they got duped.
*  You're just ignoring obvious signs.
*  Well, the Cardinals are just like the zigzag team.
*  Like it's like, oh, they're the-
*  And then all of a sudden they're losing by 30.
*  And certain defenses just seem like they can shut down Kyler completely.
*  And then other ones just let them run around.
*  And I never understand how teams don't just defend Kyler the same way.
*  Giants are probably in that-
*  I hated myself for picking the Giants last week.
*  You had the Eagles and I was like, I don't know.
*  I kind of like the-
*  I hated myself one, you know, eight minutes into that game.
*  So if I gave you a parlay with the Jags up to plus seven and a half,
*  and the Over up to 39 and a half, and it was minus 120, you're not intrigued at all.
*  Because there's probably gonna be points in this game, right?
*  You could do the- I know you don't like team totals.
*  House- you got mad at House about that.
*  But why not just bet the Jags team total?
*  I just had bad luck with team totals.
*  I'm not saying I'm right or wrong.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah, I mean-
*  I just stink at them.
*  I like the Jags.
*  I think there'll be points.
*  So I generally agree with that.
*  All right, I'm gonna cross them off.
*  This next game I might not cross off.
*  Colts, who, as we said, they might be the good bad team.
*  Catching Houston in a really interesting spot where they've already played them, the game was close.
*  Yeah.
*  Every game they're in is tight, and they're getting five and a half at home.
*  And I don't understand without Nico Collins, why I wouldn't tease the Colts backwards
*  and play around with the over-under.
*  Why wouldn't I do that?
*  Every advanced stat- and DeBundo and I have talked about this-
*  every advanced stat on the Texans is suggesting they're a fraud.
*  And I like the Texans coming into the season, but if you look at any of the offensive stuff
*  and what they're doing on early downs, they're what, plus six on the season?
*  Their point differential, like their offense is underachieved,
*  maybe as much as any offense in the NFL.
*  But they didn't have Mixon for half of that.
*  Yeah, but I don't know.
*  Like Joe Mixon's fine, but I'm not-
*  if Joe Mixon means that much to your offense, then you might have some issues.
*  So I know they don't have Nico Collins, but yeah, I like the Colts a little bit.
*  In that game, I don't totally trust it, but I don't trust that Texans team.
*  I think fading the Texans while their record's really good
*  and all the numbers suggest they might not be that good
*  is probably a good play for the next whatever, two, three weeks.
*  Do you believe in the second game thing?
*  I think it's fascinating how much the perception of these two teams
*  has even changed in the last seven weeks.
*  Like both have overperformed relative- if you just look at their records, right?
*  If you told a Colts fan before the season,
*  we're going to be four and three, they would have taken it.
*  Texans, five and two, they feel great.
*  And yet, I feel like under the hood, both are kind of worse.
*  Like Richardson has been worse than I think most expected.
*  It's very boomer bust.
*  And honestly, Stroud has been very boomer bust.
*  And the whole Texans offense is, okay, it's third down, Stroud drops back.
*  He looks- where's Nico Collins?
*  He throws in the ball and they move the chains.
*  That's the whole offense.
*  And the last two weeks, they did it to your team, everybody has.
*  They can't score in the second half.
*  Every game, it's like three points second half, three points second half
*  against Buffalo, against pretty much every team they played this year.
*  Last week, Stroud couldn't get to 100 pass yards.
*  So I don't really trust this offense.
*  The Colts to 11 and a half and the under up to 52 and a half.
*  The only way I lose that is if Anthony Richardson just loses his mind
*  and throws like a pick six and has a fumble.
*  I haven't liked what I've seen from him at all.
*  It doesn't seem like he's ready to be an efficient starting quarterback yet.
*  The thing that made him special was the running,
*  which they seem a little more hesitant for him to do now.
*  So now it's like, well, what is this then?
*  We were being promised this Cam Newton, Josh Allen physical threat
*  who's going to run the ball and now they're seemingly afraid to do that.
*  This is your favorite team.
*  But don't you feel like they have them on the shackles basically?
*  We were sitting in the movie theater in the Spotify office on Sunday
*  and at one point Danny Kelly turned around and said,
*  are you still a believer?
*  I'm like, yes, but I have to be a little quieter about my belief now.
*  It's harder for me to put my chest out and say,
*  we got the QB one in the draft because obviously Stroud's been as good as he's been.
*  I'm still happy they took him over Levis because that was basically the option.
*  Right.
*  And I'm going to say that word.
*  It's a low bar to clear.
*  It's a low bar to clear.
*  I don't know how confident you are.
*  You had to take the swing and I'm still not out yet.
*  Well, they're in a weird spot because they're four and three
*  in a conference that's not that good.
*  Right.
*  In the defense that stinks.
*  Right.
*  But I like your receiver weapons and it seems like whoever's in the game can run the ball.
*  So I don't know.
*  I'm going to mark this one.
*  I don't think these two teams can get to...
*  Their first game was 56 points.
*  That was with Nico Collins and with Richardson hitting some bombs.
*  I don't see that happening again.
*  I'm going to mark that one down.
*  And then the Chief Raiders game is a stay away to me.
*  As much as I want to be like, oh, they talk shit to my homes.
*  I just think those home teams getting that many points,
*  the history of that is a nightmare with Teases.
*  And we have the Browns in that situation and we have the Raiders.
*  I think the Raiders are awful.
*  To me, that's an automatic no play.
*  It's probably a stay away division game line that high.
*  I am tempted a little bit though with the Chiefs with the way they've played the last two weeks.
*  They've had double digit wins in each of those games.
*  And I agree with you that my home's narrative thing is kind of a factor.
*  I'm sure that he's looking for anything.
*  Last week, look how we put their underdogs.
*  And I know we had the two interceptions,
*  but he was treating that game with the way he was running.
*  Like that was a big game.
*  And that Raiders team just, I mean, they're just waiting to...
*  I mean, they've already collapsed.
*  They're just waiting to collapse more.
*  They traded their best wide receiver.
*  They've got nothing to look forward to.
*  They have no players.
*  They can't run the ball or stop the run.
*  And they turn it over.
*  Their defense isn't good.
*  Their defense was good last year when they played the Chiefs and upset them.
*  Their defense this year is like a bottom five unit.
*  So if I had to pick a side, I would pick the Chiefs.
*  But I'm kind of with you.
*  I like to stay away when it's a division game that line that high.
*  So if I gave you this eight point tease, which is even money on Fandl,
*  Ravens minus nine and a half, Lions minus 10 and a half, and Chiefs minus nine and a half,
*  and you could tease all those under three and all of them have to cover.
*  Who would you be the most worried about?
*  Ravens, Lions or Chiefs.
*  It has to be the Ravens.
*  Right?
*  The first game with Jameis?
*  Well, which could go either way.
*  Right.
*  But that's you're introducing variants.
*  I think that Brown's defense has been OK.
*  I agree.
*  You know, and Schwartz, the problem is the Ravens are rushing for 200 plus yards a game.
*  Yeah, I just I can't.
*  Betting against Jameis seems smart.
*  The Ravens have given up the most 20 plus yard plays in the league.
*  So if Jameis wants to get in there and lob some balls up, see what happens, could get dicey.
*  This feels like the kind of game that we look we look late in the fourth quarter
*  and you're looking at and you're like, wait, Baltimore's up three with the ball.
*  I know it seems too easy.
*  I think that teases the stay away, but I looked at it long and hard.
*  Dolphins against the Cardinals with Tua coming back.
*  And the Dolphins actually played pretty well last week considering they don't have a quarterback.
*  I thought their defense kept them hanging around, but I just this to me seems like an all time
*  zigzag stay away.
*  100 percent.
*  I didn't even want no part of the game.
*  I agree.
*  I don't know what to expect.
*  Arizona might be a no bet team for me now.
*  I don't know how the Chargers didn't beat them.
*  I don't even really know what the Cardinals did.
*  And then you guys get you guys have a minute to talk me into the Cowboys plus four and a half
*  against 49ers.
*  Go.
*  I'm not doing it.
*  I like the other side.
*  This Cowboys defense stinks.
*  I don't care who's out for the 49ers.
*  Give me Kyle Shanahan against the Cowboys defense that probably still won't have Michael
*  Parsons that can't stop anybody.
*  And I like the Niners in that I'm not a believer in this Cowboys team at all.
*  I think the Niners actually bounce back in that game.
*  I've been a Dak guy forever, but there's one team he has never solved and it's the Niners.
*  Their defense, no matter who the coordinator was, that personnel like Warner's ability to
*  take away the middle of the field has really, I think, hurt that hurt Dak.
*  And he's always had problems in that matchup.
*  That's what scares me the most.
*  More than any of the Niners stuff.
*  I mean, offensively, they look like a mess.
*  You guys talked about on the Ringer NFL show all yack now.
*  It's no more easy button plays for Purdy to just kind of get guys in space and just
*  dominate the Monstars are no longer.
*  But I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  Kind of a must win for the Niners, too.
*  Yeah, they'd be three and five.
*  Well, Dallas isn't good.
*  I mean, that's the reason to pick the Niners over everything else is I just don't think
*  Dallas is good.
*  But I also don't know who I'm scared of Niners if Debo doesn't play.
*  So now it's just like I got to stop George Kittle.
*  This feels like all the nerds after this game are like, oh my God, Kyle Shanahan,
*  look at what he did on this run play.
*  And oh my God, he had this linebacker in a blender.
*  That type of game.
*  The Ronnie Bell game somehow.
*  Yeah.
*  Stay away.
*  Okay.
*  Let's go to the picks that I actually liked.
*  So and you guys can feel free to throw your body in front of any of these.
*  Oh, first of all, before I do that, what's your favorite other than the Bills?
*  I like the Bears.
*  I have them.
*  They're coming up.
*  What's your favorite?
*  I'm going to go with the Jacks.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, I hate it.
*  I hate having part of it.
*  But give me the Jacksonville.
*  I'm going to hate this on Sunday.
*  But at least it's not a London game.
*  You won't feel terrible until like, you know, two o'clock Eastern time.
*  You and Raheem just cannot resist.
*  You just can't.
*  And Austin Gale is the worst.
*  Like he was like Deshawn's last fan.
*  So no, this is the week.
*  I think he can get it going.
*  He needed Deshawn to keep trying so he could have the content on Twitter where he could say
*  Deshawn is the worst quarterback in the history of football.
*  He just would not give up on him.
*  Okay.
*  My first favorite game.
*  Sorry, Shield.
*  The Bengals down to minus one and a half against the Eagles.
*  Okay.
*  I don't think you can stop passing offenses.
*  And I mean you, like you're on the Eagles.
*  I just don't think you're going to be able to stop Higgins and Burrow and Chase.
*  And I think that Tampa game a couple weeks ago was more of a snapshot for who you are on defense.
*  It could be.
*  Now the last two weeks, they haven't allowed a touchdown.
*  I know they've played.
*  Who did you play?
*  They played bad offenses.
*  It's true.
*  Bad offenses?
*  You played Deshawn?
*  You played Danny Dimes?
*  Listen, Dimes was carving up some defenses earlier this season.
*  No, it's true.
*  This is a test for them.
*  I will say their corners though have played really well.
*  When they were struggling against the Bucs, a lot of it was the pass rush wasn't getting home.
*  They had eight sacks last week against the Giants.
*  Again, I know it's the Giants, but their corners, the rookie Quinion Mitchell and Darius Slay
*  have been having awesome seasons here.
*  So it's going to be a lot of one-on-one.
*  I think on the outside with those corners versus the Bengals receivers.
*  And can the Eagles pass rush get home without blitzing?
*  So I actually took the Eagles this week.
*  Now I was against them last week, but I was on the Eagles this week because I think Saquon
*  can have a monster game here against the Bengals.
*  So that's the fear.
*  Yeah, since he had some bad defensive stats with them.
*  They're actually higher on DBOA than Philly is, but we're just staying in the bundle.
*  So you want to guess how many points the Eagles have in the first quarter this year?
*  It's not many.
*  It's not any.
*  Zero.
*  They still have not scored in the first quarter.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, Kellen Moore, I don't know what to make of that.
*  I mean, the offense looks very similar to what it looked like last year.
*  The passing game is a mess.
*  If there's a reason to take the Bengals, it's because the Eagles,
*  they had 21 dropbacks last week and seven of them were a scramble or a sack.
*  They throw a goal ball stage at Brown.
*  There's literally nothing else with this entire passing game.
*  So I understand that reason to take the Bengals.
*  I actually like the under in this game.
*  I think both defenses are going to play pretty well and it's going to be a little low scoring.
*  I was looking at my favorite bet on Findo, the first half game bet.
*  And I thought I'd get more value on Bengals when first half Bengals won game,
*  but it's only plus 130.
*  It's not worth it.
*  Maybe maybe she also do the cousin South special do Bengals first half Eagles game.
*  Come back.
*  Maybe.
*  That is plus 750.
*  Oh, oh, lean into the little bit sprinkle.
*  Where are you on hurts mentally these days?
*  He hasn't played well.
*  I mean, their passing game is a mess.
*  He's turning down throws.
*  They're playing like they did his that 2021 when it was just run the ball, run the ball,
*  run the ball, hit a couple deep shots and that's the offense and they've got nothing else.
*  So he's got to play better.
*  There's jokes about how they're like a service Academy just run, run, run.
*  Even Navy and army have more interesting offenses than the Eagles do now.
*  My fear with taking the Bengals is their offensive lines banged up and your defensive line
*  could just take over the game and burrow would be running around for his life.
*  But I think the Bengals can move the ball and throw on them.
*  I think borrows 70% completion this year is either leading the league or second,
*  which is basically the Tampa recipe of just the chains are moving.
*  Balls going six yards here, 15, six, and they take the lead early and then you're in a spot.
*  You don't want to be in if you're the Eagles.
*  Yeah, that absolutely could happen.
*  I think you're right.
*  The left tackle injury for the Bengals against the Eagles pass rush.
*  Can they get home?
*  That'll probably determine the game.
*  Bengals run defense has been a little better since rankings and Hill came back.
*  The two defensive tackles, but they also played some bad run offenses.
*  I'm not sure where I stand on Cincinnati run defense.
*  Yeah, they play the same two teams, right?
*  The Giants and the Browns the last two weeks, same two teams as the Eagles.
*  Are you ready to see the Bengals go three and five?
*  That seems improbable to me.
*  Especially for someone like me who picked them to win the Super Bowl.
*  So yeah, I think I'm going to keep them in the division.
*  So I heard all the warning flags.
*  I think I might keep that one.
*  Next one is the Bears, which it sounds like we all like.
*  That's up to two and a half.
*  I'm going to do the rare thing of if Daniel somehow plays,
*  I must feel like that bet should be scratched.
*  I agree with that.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I don't think that's fair to be stuck with that line if Daniel's playing,
*  but it doesn't seem like he's going to play.
*  I think I would have liked the Bears anyway in this game.
*  Their defense, the stats are pretty good.
*  They're third against on first down, seventh on third down.
*  They're fifth yards per play.
*  Third turnovers.
*  They're good in the havoc stuff.
*  I like that havoc ranking.
*  And then Caleb looked really good against some bad teams and some bad defenses.
*  Guess who doesn't have a good defense?
*  Washington.
*  So whether Daniel's plays or not, I think they can move the ball.
*  He's got all three receivers.
*  This feels like a get everyone's hope up in a real way.
*  Bears win followed by their schedule gets harder.
*  Well, they've got the hardest remaining schedule in the NFL.
*  If you look at the betting markets and win totals.
*  My big, I mean, I don't know if I would like it if Daniel's was playing, but Mariota,
*  I think people are looking at that game last week and, oh,
*  Cliff Kingsbury created this quarterback proof offense.
*  It was the Carolina Panthers.
*  We've seen enough.
*  By far the worst team.
*  Yeah, we've seen enough of Marcus Mariota over the years.
*  I want a three game sample of Marcus Mariota and this offense is going to be trash.
*  So that's the reason this Bears defense, you mentioned it,
*  they don't give up 20 points against good offenses.
*  So against Marcus Mariota, I think after this game, we're being like, wow,
*  Jaden Daniels was a big reason why that commander's offense was good.
*  You lose all the explosive plays with Mariota.
*  He's going to have a dumb turnover and there's a reason,
*  he's been in the league for a long time and nobody's ever really been happy with the experience.
*  He got benched when he was on the Netflix show.
*  Yeah, that was an amazing day.
*  He just left the show and they're like, yeah, I'm out and I'm out on the show as well.
*  What do you have to add?
*  This game for me, I wrote the least on it just because I don't have a strong opinion,
*  but I don't really see the case for Washington.
*  There's one thing that they've gained and no team has gained more win probability from turnovers
*  than the commanders this year.
*  That tends to be kind of fluky.
*  This is the Bears off the buy, right?
*  So if we're going to see any imagination from this offense,
*  which we have seen very little of thus far, maybe this is the spot we see it from Chicago
*  because I still have major questions about their offense.
*  Like you said, they beat up on some of the worst defenses in the league.
*  It would be a horrific Bears loss.
*  Like, wow, we just lost to Marcus Mariota
*  and our schedule is about to get harder.
*  Conversely, Washington wins.
*  They're fine.
*  It's like, hey, our record is still awesome.
*  We still have the NFC East.
*  We still have control over it.
*  We didn't have Daniels for this game.
*  We're fine.
*  The commanders still have to play Philly and Dallas twice each.
*  So the NFC East is going to be decided much later than this week for sure.
*  They have to play Philly twice and they have the privilege of playing Dallas twice.
*  Not sure how Dallas gets any stops, but I'm still not.
*  DAC has just dominated the NFC East in a way that I refuse to give up on them
*  stealing a bunch of division games and somehow sneaking in.
*  Falcons-Bucks is my next one.
*  I don't understand this line at all and I do understand it, but I also don't.
*  The Falcons, this line moved to Falcons minus two and a half.
*  They looked awful last week against Seattle.
*  Chris Godwin and Mike Evans are no longer playing for the Bucks.
*  We're skipping over this.
*  That was the whole reason they were successful.
*  And Bucky Irving is pretty good too.
*  But Baker had these two great receivers that he had real chemistry with and was
*  just moving the ball left and right.
*  And in one game both of them went down.
*  I just picked up Jalen McMillan in two of my leagues for big money by the way.
*  He's the new number one.
*  He's 22 years old.
*  Feels like a little must-win-ish for the Falcons.
*  Coming off an awful loss.
*  I get it.
*  They can't rush the passer, but I just find it hard to believe they're not going to be able
*  to beat the Bucks without any star receivers.
*  I've got the Falcons.
*  You nailed it.
*  I've got the Falcons.
*  You watched that Bucks offense.
*  It's not just like, oh, they lost good play.
*  That was the offense.
*  If those two guys can't win one-on-one or create explosive plays or yards after the catch,
*  I don't know.
*  Are they good enough to scheme stuff?
*  And you lose both of them.
*  It's not like you lost one of them.
*  You know what it's like if you had opening night for the Sixers and the bead and Paul
*  George didn't play?
*  Who's Yabba Selle?
*  Who's going to be playing?
*  Jalen McMillan is Yabba Selle.
*  I'm not sure.
*  Atlanta's offense, fifth against the fifth passing.
*  Tampa's D, 29th against the pass.
*  28th first down.
*  Their defense isn't that good.
*  They try to do a lot of gimmicks with the blitzes and stuff, which might work against
*  cousins because the offensive line-ups have been great.
*  But I just, you know, first game, Atlanta stole it.
*  So there's a revenge spot.
*  Kirk threw for 500 plus yards in that game.
*  And Tampa Bay's secondary has given up more explosives than anybody,
*  them in Baltimore, given up the most explosives in the league.
*  So Atlanta is, I'm looking up the standings.
*  I did tease Tampa for the record.
*  Up to eight and a half.
*  Yeah.
*  So Atlanta's four and three and Tampa's four and three.
*  This game's for the division.
*  For the division in week eight?
*  If Atlanta wins, they're going to be two games up with the tiebreaker and Tampa's
*  not going to have their best receivers.
*  Atlanta wins, this division's kind of over.
*  Well, more amazing is that one of these
*  teams might have five wins after week eight.
*  Like, what the fuck?
*  I almost feel like this has to be a tie, but I mean, if Atlanta loses this game,
*  that's embarrassing.
*  You can't beat the Bucs without Mike Evans and Chris Godwin.
*  That's literally their whole team.
*  Yeah, that's my only, is it a little rat liney?
*  I mean, I'm with you.
*  I saw a minus two and a half.
*  Well, Atlanta lost by 20 to fucking Seattle last week.
*  So I don't, and Atlanta, they're four and three, but literally could be one and six.
*  Yeah.
*  Atlanta's had one game that wasn't down to the final possession, basically,
*  or two games now with last week.
*  Every other game is like two minutes to go.
*  They're within six either way and Kirk's got to lead a drive to try to win it or lose it.
*  And they got a couple home.
*  They didn't get others home.
*  But yeah, these division games at home, catching eight and a half and a tease.
*  I love Tampa.
*  You love Tampa?
*  And a tease.
*  And a tease.
*  Name four Tampa receivers.
*  Do I get to count the running backs?
*  Jerry McMillan?
*  No.
*  Name four.
*  That's the thing though.
*  Who do they run in a four receiver set?
*  They're not going to.
*  That's the one concern.
*  So they run a lot of 11 personnel.
*  They don't have three full receivers now, so they got to go a little heavier.
*  But K.Dotten, K.Dotten big game this week.
*  Young and experienced, youthful exuberance.
*  We just got to keep them in the ring or fold.
*  That's right.
*  Trey Palmer's going to be pissed off.
*  He's going to get a big game for him.
*  Last one.
*  I'm marking the Falcons down.
*  If they lose that game, they should keep up the team.
*  By the way, Sheil, who, if they didn't take Penex after having seen all the rookies,
*  who should they have taken that would have had a huge impact for them at number eight?
*  Yeah, I'm trying to think of who was taking.
*  I mean, I don't want to be a homer,
*  but Quinian Mitchell would be looking very good as a corner in that secondary.
*  And just look at like the last three years, the guys they could have had.
*  Oh my God.
*  Three or four years.
*  They really could have built on the lines of scrimmage very well.
*  But yeah, that was one name that came to mind.
*  Byron Murphy, I know he got hurt, but I think he would have been working for them too.
*  Jared Verst, I mean, there were definitely good defensive players
*  that they could have taken and added to that group.
*  One of the stories is that none of the defensive guys have really taken the leap.
*  But we knew that in the draft, right?
*  Nobody was taken until pick 15.
*  People were pretty down on it.
*  But yeah, you're right.
*  The cornerback that you got, the guy Detroit got, the D-back.
*  Arnold, yeah.
*  It seems like those have been kind of the winners.
*  Yeah, there hasn't been one dominant guy yet.
*  You're looking at the defensive rookie of the year odds.
*  I can tell.
*  Jared Verst is the favorite.
*  And Verst was good last year.
*  Probably the guy that, you know, if you had to pick one guy, if they could redo it,
*  that'd probably be the guy.
*  All right.
*  Last one that I really liked.
*  And I try not, sorry, Kyle, try not to bet against the Patriots.
*  Oh, Kyle's sad.
*  You're playing seven with the Jets?
*  No, I'm not.
*  I'm going to tease the Jets with the over of 35, down to 35 and a half.
*  The over is 41 and a half.
*  Tease the Jets to one.
*  Over 35 and a half.
*  The Pats are sneaky.
*  The over underlines have not caught up to the team they have.
*  Their defense sucks.
*  It's awful.
*  The quarterback actually makes some plays.
*  Mays, pretty good.
*  And they're a garbage time threat, right?
*  They're an end of the half, two minute warning.
*  They can actually get a field goal.
*  They're not, offense isn't terrible.
*  And it's also an all time must win for the Jets.
*  Like their season's over if they don't win this.
*  They beat them already.
*  And the only fear would be like a 24 to three type game,
*  like what they had on the Thursday night.
*  But this Pats team is going to be able to put up like 14.
*  So 35 and a half seems right.
*  Is there any way the Pats actually win this game?
*  Wait, what's the teaser?
*  So Jets down to minus one.
*  Minus one.
*  Over to 35 and a half.
*  I just need to get to 37 points.
*  Jets can win 2017 and I win.
*  Is it a good sign that Devontae Adams had to give a fiery postgame speech
*  when he had been in New Jersey for like three days after last week's game?
*  Did you see this story?
*  I did.
*  So you have that.
*  I mean, everything that can go wrong has gone wrong with the Jets.
*  You mentioned it.
*  Drake May will push the ball downfield.
*  The Jets defense has actually been the bigger story over their offense.
*  They're 21st in defensive DVOA.
*  The offense ranks exactly the same.
*  21st.
*  You thought you were getting a mediocre offense with a great defense
*  and their defense isn't good.
*  But Rodgers basically said that.
*  He's like, our offense needs to take care of our defense.
*  We need to score points, give them lead.
*  He's basically saying our defense sucks.
*  Which I was surprised by.
*  But as usual, I heard Rodgers said something.
*  I think you're on the right side.
*  I would be afraid to have any wager depending on the New York Jets with the way this season has gone.
*  I don't think you understand.
*  And nobody does because nobody cares about the Patriots nor should they.
*  This was a pretty traumatic week in Patriots Nation.
*  I've been following.
*  The Mayo soft thing.
*  First of all, they were so...
*  And we talked about it Sunday night in the pod, so I'm not going to be harsh on that.
*  They were so bad on Sunday night and so poorly coached and just everything was mismanaged
*  and they looked awful.
*  And then the quotes after the game from him,
*  which as usually Mayo took no culpability for anything and just blames everybody else,
*  says he's soft and that really went badly.
*  And then Belichick said, fuck it.
*  And just started doing little sniper shots on him.
*  And eight different shows he's on and just escalated the stakes.
*  And there's like a real conversation now in Massachusetts because God knows they love...
*  The media loves this stuff there.
*  It's like, could this guy be one and done?
*  Would Kraft do this?
*  I personally don't think he would.
*  I think he'll give him more time.
*  But it's a fucking mess.
*  The wide receiver room.
*  They've had like three different guys have complained publicly.
*  No other team has this.
*  I feel like this is an under the radar, like huge story for week eight.
*  With everything you said, and I've been following it all week long.
*  Like if they come out and are just get blown out by 35 points at home,
*  what are you doing after that with the head coach?
*  Now, is there a chance that it's not as bad on the inside as it seems on the outside?
*  And they come out and they play well and some players actually like Gerard Mayo
*  and they figure some things out.
*  That's the other thing.
*  Maybe you come out of this saying, oh my gosh, everything last week was so overblown
*  with the way they played in London and they're competitive in this game.
*  But they're a sneaky big story, I feel like, in this week.
*  Listen, the player podcasts are for the most part ridiculous.
*  And player interviews, ex-player interviews, you always have to take with a grain of salt.
*  I was shocked by how many people who talk or have platforms were like,
*  wow, you don't call your team soft.
*  That's never worked.
*  That's never motivated anybody.
*  That's like the number one thing you can't do.
*  Like people are pretty horrified by it.
*  You try to walk it back the next day.
*  He's like, I wasn't saying the team was soft.
*  I was saying we played soft.
*  It's like, no, you said the team was soft.
*  That's actually what you did.
*  And it's one of like many huge mistakes he's made.
*  But they just seem really poorly prepared and poorly coached,
*  which every year there's two teams, right?
*  Like Carolina last year with Ryke, you knew something was like way off.
*  It's like something, Monty Williams and the Pistons.
*  It's like this seems off.
*  Something's wrong.
*  And that's the vibe I'm getting from the Pats.
*  It just doesn't seem right.
*  What do you see when you're watching?
*  Maybe they could try a different former linebacker as their head coach next year.
*  Mike Vrabel?
*  He is available, I believe.
*  Yeah, I think the offense is kind of interesting early in the game.
*  And then the second half offenses have not been as inspiring.
*  Once they get off the script.
*  Once they try to establish the run, it's a disaster because they can't run the ball.
*  But the ones that I like, they were 31st in explosive pass rate the first five weeks with
*  Percet.
*  They're up to 15th the last few weeks.
*  Yeah, Kyle.
*  Hitting some big plays down the field.
*  They finally hit some 10, 20 plus yard plays.
*  And that's when you don't have a good, you've talked about this,
*  you don't have a good offense, try to hit some big plays and see what happens.
*  We had a Drew Bledsoe season.
*  I think it was the second season.
*  They're the same thing, couldn't run the ball.
*  Team wasn't very good and they were just like, Drew aired out.
*  And he did and it was kind of, it kind of worked a little bit.
*  And he's just flinging the ball.
*  They had Ben Coats that year.
*  I have a feeling if they're actually going to try to win this game, which I would assume
*  they'd want to because it's the Jets.
*  That's it for the run game.
*  They can't run the ball.
*  The line sucks.
*  So I just generally like the over because I don't think they're going to be able to
*  stop the Jets.
*  The tackling linebackers, they've made history with how bad the tackling is.
*  I've never seen anything like it.
*  So I think Breeze Hall could have a big game.
*  But so I like Jets minus one with the over 35 and a half.
*  So all right, so we have four on the fence with Colts plus 11 and a half with the under 52
*  and a half in Houston.
*  I like it.
*  You guys vote on that.
*  You like that one?
*  I like it.
*  I like it.
*  Okay.
*  So we'll add that.
*  Cardiac Colts.
*  And then Bills minus three in Seattle.
*  What are your thoughts?
*  I'm completely passing on this game.
*  I'm excited to watch it.
*  It's actually a game I'm most excited to watch.
*  I like it.
*  It's one of my favorite.
*  Listen, I thought the bundle, you know, we had a nice dinner last night, but I thought
*  he would come in, support me by pick.
*  But that's okay.
*  Listen, you got to speak with whatever you're feeling at the time.
*  I do like the Bills minus three in Seattle.
*  Well, maybe what I can do is do little half bets.
*  Or we could do a parlay with all three of those.
*  Bills minus three.
*  Jags plus seven and a half in the over.
*  Or maybe just Bills minus three with Jags plus seven and a half.
*  I do feel like Charlie at the wall and it's always sunny.
*  And I know that they filmed it right outside the office.
*  I try to keep track of all the teasers that have just been thrown at me in the last 10 minutes.
*  What if we teased Jags Bill up to, or not teased,
*  nudged it up to plus seven and a half so we get that touchdown buffer
*  with Bills minus three and it's a debundo shield parlay?
*  All right.
*  You're responsible for the Jags part of that.
*  Let's do it.
*  There you go.
*  All right.
*  So we just looked this up.
*  Bills minus three and then the Jags up to plus seven and a half.
*  That parlay is plus 179.
*  So I think we'll sprinkle something on that too.
*  I also need an anytime touchdown scorer.
*  Preferably a tight end because Fandl is running a very cool touchdown bonus.
*  What is, what are we getting for that one, Kyle?
*  30% profit boost.
*  Has to be a tight end?
*  Does it have to be a tight end?
*  No.
*  I was going to say Kate Otton is looking real good this weekend.
*  Kate Otton?
*  For the Bucks.
*  Yeah.
*  Tucker Kraft?
*  Somebody's got to score.
*  Oh my God.
*  Tucker Kraft.
*  Emotional hedge.
*  You lose there?
*  No, we're not emotionally hedging Tucker Kraft.
*  I do Brian Thomas often so maybe he could score for the Jags.
*  So you got Kate?
*  The only reliable receiver.
*  Kate Otton plus 180 anytime scorer?
*  Sure.
*  I love it.
*  Yeah.
*  Somebody's got to score for the Bucks.
*  They will eventually get points in the game, right?
*  So.
*  All right.
*  Hopefully.
*  What a performance by you.
*  Kate Otton and the Jags just coming in on fire.
*  What a performance.
*  This is the NFL.
*  And we're definitely doing Colts under.
*  Okay.
*  I got this.
*  All right, Kyle, it's time.
*  The million dollar picks for week eight coming off a $580,000 windfall last week
*  that really should have been more.
*  We're up $163,000 for the year.
*  Mainly because I don't bet on Deshaun Watson
*  do some of the stuff your buddy Austin Gale does on paper chasers.
*  I'm glad we came up with a name finally for
*  the pod.
*  I've got some fun.
*  I had a bunch of trademark violations before we got to paper chasers.
*  Million dollar picks week eight.
*  We all love the Bears minus two and a half against Marcus Maradona and
*  Washington.
*  Do we put the caveat that if Daniels plays, this is a no bet or do we just ride it?
*  I would be shocked if Daniels plays.
*  Okay.
*  Let's just ride it.
*  You know what?
*  We're gambling.
*  Let's go.
*  Bears minus two and a half.
*  Washington doesn't need this game.
*  This is the last easy Bears game for gets hard.
*  Washington D is terrible.
*  The Bears come with the ball and that's our first one.
*  Falcons minus two and a half against the depleted bucks.
*  The bundle doesn't like it, but you, you like the bucks and the T's a little bit,
*  even though you couldn't name three receivers on the team.
*  Sheila and I like the Falcons in a bunch back minus two and a half.
*  No Mike Evans, no Chris Godwin just played on a Monday night.
*  These teams have already played.
*  This feels like Atlanta gets their team right.
*  That's two.
*  The Bengals.
*  Minus one and a half against the Philadelphia Eagles.
*  She'll doesn't like this one.
*  The bundle likes it.
*  The bundle likes it.
*  Yeah, a little bit.
*  You mentioned havoc.
*  I'm a little scared because the Bengals do not create much.
*  They do not create much havoc.
*  The havoc might be on the Philadelphia sideline with people throwing stuff.
*  I just think we saw this game a few weeks ago, a version of it with Tampa where they just
*  threw on Philly the whole game.
*  Philly's defense wore down.
*  The Bengals I think can do that again.
*  I don't think the Bengals are going three and five.
*  So that's three.
*  We're going to put $200,000 on each of those.
*  We are also putting $200,000 on the Jets teased down to minus one with the over of 30,
*  down to 35 and a half because Drake may can get cheap points.
*  And I think the Jets win.
*  If the Jets lose this game, this becomes one of the dark moments in Jets history.
*  They lose this dysfunctional Pats team that's turning on the coach.
*  Come on.
*  And we all like this one.
*  Another tease.
*  Colts up to 11 and a half against Houston.
*  They've already played the under up to 52 and a half.
*  53 points needs to beat this.
*  No, Nico Collins.
*  Yeah, he's dominated the Colts in this head to head.
*  The fear would be the Anthony Richardson pick six like to start the first quarter.
*  It's all sudden at seven.
*  Nothing.
*  You're like, oh my God.
*  All right.
*  And then last but not least, we're doing a little hundred K on a DeBundo shield parlay.
*  She'll love the bills minus three against Seattle.
*  The bundle legs to Jags.
*  We're going to bring them up to plus seven and a half.
*  That is plus 179 on Fandle.
*  So we'll put actually we'll put 120 K on that so they get that over 200.
*  And then last but not least, Fandle's 30% touchdown scoring boost.
*  Are you in on that?
*  I can't wait.
*  This is all I'm going to be watching.
*  Kedon plus 180.
*  I'm going to have to have a screen on Falcon's Bucks now for some reason.
*  A little we'll throw 25 K on that just to respect ourselves.
*  Yes.
*  Chio Capote, we can hear you on the Ringer NFL show.
*  DeBundo, you're on the Ringer gambling show.
*  You pop on Philly special from time to time.
*  Right.
*  We had a short lived Philly's playoff run to reminisce my short lives.
*  Hey, I didn't have a playoff run at all.
*  So I'm jealous.
*  Good to see you guys.
*  You too.
*  See you too.
