# Where Does This Injury Put the New York Jets? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdZ9t8av5VI)
*  Aaron Rodgers, out for the year, touring Achilles.
*  Sean Fantasy, who I've worked with for 11 plus years at this point.
*  Die Hard, Jets, Mets fan, Knicks.
*  Been a rough ride, rocky road.
*  After Rodgers went down five minutes into the game, you just tweeted goodbye.
*  And then didn't respond to texts.
*  We didn't know.
*  I was saying it was like, Marketson's gone.
*  There is no Marketson.
*  It's like, Sean's gone.
*  There is no Sean.
*  How are we feeling today?
*  Um, thanks for having me on the show, Bill.
*  Really kind of you to have me on.
*  Um, I, I feel justified in all of my melodramatic curse talk.
*  I'm sure, I'm sure I feel similar to how you felt in 2002, 2003, you know, with the socks
*  and feeling anxiety.
*  I feel bad.
*  Um, I feel even worse actually because they won for a variety of reasons, but we got a
*  chance to see like, this is a really cool, fun, exciting team.
*  And they, I don't know if they were Super Bowl bound, but it's easy to imagine a world
*  in which they could have been Super Bowl bound.
*  So yeah, I feel, I feel very bad.
*  Very bad.
*  Well, I think the, the revelation from last night was that Bruce looked like 95% of where
*  he was last year, which I was not expecting.
*  And he was a weird fantasy football guy.
*  It was people like, when's he going to be a hundred percent?
*  Is it going to happen?
*  So the fact that he looked like that almost made the Rogers thing worse as the game was
*  going on. If it was even possible to feel worse about it, because it's like, oh, this
*  guy's like a guy again.
*  Yeah, I even at the very beginning of the game, it's stupid to nitpick the first four
*  play calls, but I was like, wow, they're really throwing a lot coming out of this game.
*  I thought the whole point of this season was to actually use the running game to power
*  Rogers. Obviously the injury is a freak injury.
*  Nothing could have prevented it.
*  He's an older player.
*  That O line is obviously problematic, but it was painful actually watching Bruce play
*  so well because that could have been really the focal point of the offense.
*  And then Aaron Rogers just needed to be competent.
*  And then this would have been a really competitive team.
*  So it's like I'm legitimately depressed about it.
*  On the other hand, I tell you what I really don't like about it.
*  I feel like this weirdly sets them back for like another two to five years, because
*  obviously you were at best case scenario going to get three years out of Aaron Rogers,
*  more likely one and a half years, something like that out of him.
*  Now it's like where is this team with all of this talent?
*  They have a bust number two overall pick that's probably going to play for them right
*  now. They have a 39 year old rehabbing.
*  So even if he comes back next year and decides he wants to play, Rogers is going to be
*  40. And they're also weirdly going to be too good to tank.
*  So they're not going to be in the top 10 of now loaded QB draft.
*  So I guess they just have to hope that another free agent hits the market in the next
*  three years. Like it's it's weirdly a generation setting injury in the first five
*  plays of the season. So it's devastating all around.
*  You somehow get your first round pick back.
*  They do because he didn't hit the 70 percent.
*  Yeah, look, man, he's 39 years old.
*  And this is this was always the concern.
*  He didn't look that good last year.
*  And there were excuses for the broken thumb.
*  Hard knocks comes in. He's in great shape.
*  But he's still an older QB and it was still to me like a pretty big variable behind
*  the offensive line. I didn't expect him to get hurt in four minutes.
*  I was power walking around L.A.
*  and I came home and I missed the start of the game and I turned it on.
*  And two seconds later, he got hurt.
*  And you could tell when he sat in the turf that it was bad.
*  But I was like, what's happening?
*  Is that am I like a man? Did I like get mugged and knocked out?
*  And I'm just imagining this.
*  How is this a real thing that's happening?
*  And then you had to watch Zach Wilson come in, which had to have been among the worst
*  hours in Jets history, right?
*  I I don't want to be too strong about this, but I hate Zach Wilson.
*  Like, I hate watching him play football.
*  Hate, hate. Like, I really can't do this this year.
*  I did say to my wife while we were watching the game in the third quarter that if he is
*  their quarterback this year, I actually just will not watch.
*  Like, I will not watch the season.
*  And then they won in stunning and exciting fashion.
*  And of course, like I got roped back in.
*  Like, it was kind of the worst of all possible situations.
*  You lose Rogers, you see all the talent on display.
*  And then as soon as the game is over, Robert Salas says Zach Wilson is our starter,
*  which like I we saw this movie that they literally showed us this movie last year.
*  It's a seven and ten team.
*  And Zach Wilson is the least fun, least competent quarterback in the NFL.
*  So I just they have to do something.
*  They're saying they're not going to do something.
*  They have to do something, though.
*  I don't know what it is.
*  Bring me Jacoby Brissette.
*  Bring me anybody but Joe Flacco and Zach Wilson.
*  Like, I just I need him to not be the quarterback this year.
*  What's the spin going to be with with Zach Wilson?
*  He got the three months he spent with Rogers really turned the corner for him,
*  because, you know, they're going to be spinning it forward.
*  Like, it's not two thousand twenty two.
*  Zach anymore. He's a different guy.
*  Did you did you see the obviously there was a normal Zach Wilson play, which is that
*  when he scrambles to the right and runs around and throws it out of bounds?
*  Yeah. Did you see did you see the Manning cast during that?
*  Now, so Peyton and Eli were there's a clip out of that moment when Zach,
*  you know, hikes the ball and runs backwards 20 yards.
*  And the look on Peyton Manning's face is like, this is disgusting.
*  How bad this guy is.
*  This is deplorable how bad he is at football.
*  And he's 100 percent right.
*  Like, it is unacceptable.
*  There's Zach Wilson learned nothing.
*  We what we saw yesterday, he threw a pass right across the middle of the field,
*  right into Matt Milano's hands because he couldn't read the linebackers.
*  That was the same guy last year.
*  Like, he didn't learn anything from Aaron Rogers.
*  Now, maybe in two years time, apprenticing under him, he could have learned something.
*  That's very possible. It's been six weeks.
*  Well, like what are you talking about?
*  There's no way he learned anything.
*  I also just I don't actually think he has the brain to be an NFL QB.
*  And so I would love for them to get him out of there as soon as possible.
*  I'm genuinely nervous that they're not going to do that.
*  I'm and you must be thrilled.
*  I mean, this is incredible for the Patriots.
*  It's huge for the Dolphins.
*  I feel like Dolphins fans must be cheering after seeing to look the way that he looked.
*  And now this Jets team that is loaded with talent is going to have to struggle to get to eight wins.
*  So they just have to do something.
*  They cannot let you can't let Garrett Wilson not have a thousand year season.
*  Like you saw the catch last night.
*  Like he's an unbelievable player.
*  I'm like grasping at straws here.
*  They have to figure something out.
*  Well, there is that moment when in the last four minutes, when it was clear,
*  they were just like, Zach Wilson's not throwing another pass in this game.
*  And if we just kick a field goal and give them the ball back, that's fine.
*  But we're at least getting three points.
*  And they had it was two or four left heading into the two minute warning.
*  And the Bills had just nine guys on the line for every play.
*  And some of the Jets were still running a little bit on them.
*  But Wilson's just by himself on the left, right?
*  He's like, it's not one of the three best receivers in the league, but he's one of the best six or one of the best seven.
*  And he's just by himself.
*  And the two minute warning is coming up.
*  And you're like, if there's ever a moment in Zach Wilson's history where just throw like a little slant pass, this is it.
*  And they're like, no, let's run the ball right in the line.
*  I honestly think it was the right call.
*  I really think it was the right call.
*  Zach Wilson in nine games last year only had two games in which he had more touchdowns than interceptions.
*  I mean, he sucks.
*  So even with Breeze Hall and Garrett Wilson on the field.
*  And frankly, I had not watched Alan Lazard play very much.
*  And I liked how he looked, too.
*  I was like, this is a weirdly could be a pretty good offense.
*  Yeah. And the Jets have had very few good offenses in their entire history, as you know.
*  And the defense was really fun.
*  Yeah.
*  But I mean, they're going to hurt a couple of quarterbacks this year.
*  They're so fast.
