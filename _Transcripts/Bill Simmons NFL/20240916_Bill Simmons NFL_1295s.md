# NFL Guess the Lines Week 3 with Cousin Sal  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW0unonOeMA)
*  Guest lines week three. Did you beat me last week too? We tied. We did. We tied 10 10. Yeah, I'm gonna be
*  101
*  By the way should mention
*  Here are the two and oh teams
*  Buffalo running Pittsburgh Chargers KC Houston
*  Minnesota New Orleans Tampa
*  Seattle so we got eight plus Philly tomorrow potentially
*  Yeah, right and which one do we say word we would bet against to make the playoffs the Saints
*  I'd really need to look at that this week
*  Because one of these teams of like I remember when the Saints started out to you know
*  And then they finished 6-11 and Dennis Allen got fired. I'm still not I know but we kind of have to do it now, right? Yeah
*  We three the Jets are home
*  They're playing the Patriots of New England, this is by the way, I think our only night game this year
*  How the mighty have fallen. That's right. Yeah. Yeah, this is it. Enjoy it. I
*  have the Jets
*  By five and I try to pick this exactly because I sure as hell did five and a half six and a half
*  You picked it exactly. I did. Yeah
*  The rest
*  The rest
*  So that's right, yeah, that's a whiff high you think so yeah
*  Yeah, the Jets last week they got killed by the Niners who then just lost to the Vikings
*  This week they barely beat the Titans even though will love us
*  We were joking earlier that it seemed like if a quarterback did have drinks before again, this is what it would look like
*  So, I don't know why would they suddenly be almost seven points against the Pats who beat the Bengals and then almost beat the Seahawks
*  I guess first home game, right? I guess the place will be
*  Pretty pumped for Aaron Rodgers. Will it make it to the distance? You've been to a Jets game
*  Is it a place that gets really pumped? It's I would say it goes the other way. Yeah, it gets more surly
*  That's what I mean by pump that's how we say in New York pump but I
*  You know, this is gonna be interesting for him. It's gonna have his family there. Oh, no way
*  It is his family doesn't talk to him. No, it's gonna be a good game. I
*  Think you could upset him. Kyle was so happy today that I was rooting for the Pats
*  You know, I have like five five futures to get them. This is come to
*  Sunday's marquee game
*  Sunday's marquee game
*  Yeah, it's really probably the Eagles and the Saints if it's two two and no teams, but we're not gonna do that
*  We're gonna go Cowboys Ravens
*  because
*  If the Cowboys coming off
*  Just getting lambasted by the Saints at home. Yeah, I wish Baltimore had won and you have the oh and two Ravens
*  Somehow playing a must-win game in week three. Yeah, right. This is I think
*  Right. This is I think
*  Gotta think at least for the division Oh and three pretty hard to bounce back and win
*  I put this line low even though it's in Dallas. I've Dallas by one and a half. Oh, you got it exactly
*  I said two
*  Thought we'd get the good don't we get the nudge there. Yeah, you don't want to say must win, right? I think it is
*  Three losses would be something
*  Because we did we did this earlier, but that the next two games after this are hard for them
*  They're home for Buffalo and at since II
*  They basically have to go two and one right two and one out of those three. Yeah
*  The problem for them is even when they have a lead I feel like the team the other team can throw the ball on them
*  And come back
*  Which makes it an unusual ball Derek Henry used to be the greatest clock killer of all time
*  What happened?
*  He still looks good. Yeah, I don't I don't know what happened watch the bulls. So it's a pretty good week next week
*  I gotta say I thought I had four watchables and
*  I had three
*  Three fairly well, they did they relieved us and I know I complain about a new and I am like maybe three others only care
*  But when they dead ten games early on and six came down to the wire
*  I was like screw these guys like I can't Scott Hanson had an aneurysm like I just just give us eight and five
*  Or eight and four stop it already and then you got three games in the afternoon two aren't competitive within like eight minutes
*  Enough spread it out
*  Yeah, there was
*  One stretch in the early games where it felt like in five games at the same time
*  There were just like pivotal two-minute stretches and they were all overlapping with each other and just like wait what I?
*  Watch hands
*  So I don't think this is gonna be an aesthetically pleasing game
*  But I can't wait to watch it Steelers Chargers in Pittsburgh
*  Two-two and oh teams two similar teams trying not to do too much on offense
*  On defense trying to win games not make mistakes
*  Team that obviously like built around the coach coaches personality
*  There's nobody believes in us on both sides
*  two teams that I backed before the year as playoff teams and
*  I'm interested to see what happens in this
*  I think the Chargers might have a slightly higher upside than the Steelers because of
*  The quarterback because the Pittsburgh quarterback we still haven't really seen him have to make a play yet
*  When and when it actually matters we've always they've always had the lead I
*  have a Steelers minus three
*  all right, I
*  Pussed out on this I thought about it for a long time
*  And I'm like I can't I don't know who's gonna be favored so I gave it the nine nine round you can't
*  Respect me as a judge. I made it a pick them and
*  You're right. It's a long way of saying you're right. It's a one. Oh, no, we're both right. It's one and a half
*  Oh, yes, well, yeah, I can't come
*  I should never have a comes. I know but they just said they never happen the Cardinals Rams game today was a pick them
*  Like heading into kickoff which I was like, I don't never seems to happen
*  I'm trying to beat you. I'm not beating the Vegas. I know I can't do that
*  Well, so in the old days minus three meant it was minus three for the home field advantage
*  That is now dropped over the years to now minus one and a half is the home field advantage
*  So they're basically saying those teams are exactly even next watchables Texans Vikings in Houston
*  Although the Texans were not watchful today. Hopefully this game will take four hours
*  I'm sorry. This is in Minnesota not in Houston my bad. So
*  I
*  Have Houston favored I
*  Had it as a two and a half
*  Before the game tonight and I think I'm just gonna keep it there
*  I'm Houston by two and a half in Minnesota move it lower move it lower
*  I had two and it's three and a half. You get it three and a half
*  Maybe the same Donald duping hasn't hit Fandel yet
*  I think he said he doesn't think he's gonna miss time
*  Can we I want to give the throw the NFL bone?
*  They still don't know how to schedule games
*  But the fact that they came out with the AJ Brown news before kickoff today
*  Means that they're sort of looking out for fantasy owners
*  Because that McCaffrey thing was so bad last week and it came down like an hour before the game when nobody can make moves
*  I think he's gonna miss time. I want to give the throw the NFL bone
*  When nobody can make moves but to they didn't have to say if AJ Brown was playing Monday night
*  You know Sunday at 1240 and they did good job by you
*  Do you think the NFL should run commercials congratulating themselves the NFL we finally care about our fans
*  It's the players. We don't care about the NFL caring about our fans since one week ago
*  Yeah, that is a good point they definitely did that for fantasy because if you started AJ Brown
*  Just an out now catastrophe
*  Next one Eagles at the Saints
*  There you go, arguably the best game of the week if the Saints are good. I
*  Have the Eagles favorite in this game. So I'm gonna say Eagles by two and a half
*  I think you're gonna beat me this week. You got it exactly. I thought it would be one
*  I guess I did like the Saints more than
*  We three easy. I usually have good week threes
*  Hmm you're up four to two, you know
*  Everyone in New Orleans hated car
*  I wonder if they I wonder if they flipped on that now because the Saints are fun like coming coming back the two big wins
*  I wonder if they'll have like an awesome crowd for this game. Awesome old-school Saints crap
*  Yeah, this feels like a gambling stay away. They were home against the Carolina right? Yeah, this is our second home game
*  Yeah, this could be a good last one Lions Cardinals. This is also in Arizona
*  This is a game that could have been like Lions minus six in the look-ahead line, but now heading into week three
*  I don't see how it's higher than three and a half. So I'm gonna say Lions three and a half
*  You get this one too. I said two
*  That's how much I like Arizona. It's three. Yeah, they're gonna make you better off the three. I
*  Think people are still gonna look at Arizona
*  They didn't see the games and say they're one-on-one and the only reason they beat the Rams is because all the guys in the Rams got
*  Hurt, but Arizona is has a good offense
*  Mm-hmm, and I regret not taking them million dollar picks this week. Can you're hot?
*  Can your guy hutch contain little Kyle Amari? Can he get him? Yeah, what are they?
*  He couldn't sack or it good. Let's click. Let's clench this is over. It's September
*  fairly watchables Colts Bears
*  Not quite bad enough to be a poop effective game, but I definitely don't want to watch this
*  It's in Indianapolis
*  Colts by two and a half
*  Come on. I
*  Don't I don't I hope people seeing this on YouTube how you're you know sauntering into the screen. Yeah, it's two and a half
*  What are you looking at? Well, I thought about changing my mind to three, but I kept it where it was
*  I said two two and a half tap two and a half it is I
*  Don't think I would put money on the Colts again anytime soon
*  No, so well, so you're calling this a stay away, right because you can't you can't go Bears
*  I really like stiking. I thought he did some weird shit today
*  Mm-hmm. Like first of all, he's in charge of the other coaches, right? So you could take Gus Bradley and be like, yeah
*  What if we just move all our guys up make Malik?
*  Well, let's try to throw deep but I thought there was some game management stuff that I just didn't agree with
*  Seahawks in Seattle playing the Dolphins
*  Which I assume no to it for that game, correct? That thought that's gonna reflect. I think so
*  Yeah, clear him right that now one week later, right? Let's say Seahawks by five
*  All right, you edge me out again I said four and a half at six and a half. Ooh pretty high
*  I'm just
*  I just can't guess more. I see. Oh, this should be five in the old days, but nobody wins by five anymore
*  So they'll make it four, right?
*  Well five becomes the appetizer and then it eventually lands at six or four right or four and a half
*  Do we have to change the Vegas zone?
*  To what like three and a half to four and a half or something
*  No, it's four and a half. No, I have five and a half because those are
*  spreads that never happen
*  Right, I'm just thinking the way they now know, you know, we don't see a lot of nine eleven point line
*  Everything seems to be smaller now
*  One Seahawks now that guy Murphy is really good for them. Yeah, I remember that rookie nose tackle
*  He was wreaking havoc in the game today. That was a really nice pick
*  49ers at the Rams is the last one and
*  It's it's a borderline poop effective cut doesn't play because I don't know who's gonna be catching balls for the Rams
*  But I have the 49ers by three and a half
*  Get me again. I
*  Had three it's seven. Let me check this
*  So they're saying cups not playing that
*  This ain't nobody's playing
*  Yeah, it's seven shit at that point. Don't play Stafford, right? Right? Just give them the week off. Just punt on the game
*  Man that's gonna be a grim Rams game. You're gonna have 40,000 honors fans there all the Rams who have tickets aren't gonna want to go
*  Yikes, you love it. You love that teaser game. You love it. I
*  Do I'm probably gonna tease that one it was one of those pretty games that make you go, huh?
*  This is what the pretty critical critics have been talking about okay poop fact a bucks home for the Broncos
*  Wow the bucks could be three no
*  Yep, I have the bucks by six and a half
*  Well
*  What do you know? You got it exactly right again. I said seven. I'm on fire. I'm glad we're catching this on YouTube
*  Yeah, we should do a headline like guy catches fire picking games
*  Like that. Yeah, you're on fire like
*  I'm trying to think of a world-renowned cheater who would be on fire, but I can't I can't just escapes me right now
*  This is always what happens. You always accused me week three cheating bill Belichick's on fire put those cameras away
*  I
*  Packers at the Titans the Malik Willis revenge game
*  Lake was
*  Back to make the Titans pay. It's a kill bill three
*  I
*  Don't see how the Titans can ever be favored against anyone and I'm gonna just say Packers by one
*  Oh, I'm gonna get one. I'm gonna get one. I said Tennessee by one Tennessee is favored by two and a half
*  So go ahead and put Malik on a teaser getting eight and a half go get it
*  It'd be funny if they asked the coach of the Titans like during the week
*  With the guys named Brian Callahan. Yeah from Callahan auto parts
*  Does does it help you having had Malik here for the last couple years to prepare for this game and normally the coaches like
*  You know, he's a competitor, but if he was just like
*  Yeah, I mean he's terrible. We watch the day after day after day. I think I can't make a throw
*  I can't wait to stack the line. We're just gonna destroy him. I
*  The what the fuck are you doing's have to be close by now between Levis and Malik
*  Coach can we see here? What the fuck are you doing?
*  Rating system. Well, I have 11 for will this year and coach at seven from Aleek
*  Put your face in your hands more often the last two years Brown's home for the Giants
*  Browns could be two and one. I mean that was one of your things with them, right? You like their schedule. Yeah, I
*  Didn't mind them especially here. I'm gonna say Browns by six and a half
*  Such a dirtbag man, you got it exactly. I don't even know why I care anymore
*  That'll reach six and a half is a number I said five
*  Yeah, sometimes true greatness can happen even on a YouTube live stream. Is this gonna be well
*  I don't think it would be an overreaction, but whichever quarterback comes up short here
*  That's that could be it it
*  I think you say whoever goes up three nothing the game is over. Oh, well that too. Yeah
*  But if the Giants can just go up three nothing it's done
*  If they're all three with dimes and Cleveland can make them look bad
*  But if they're all in three and if Watson doesn't show up here
*  there's gonna be a
*  suspicious investigation by midweek
*  Cleveland's pass rush was very good today, but that's not why Jacksonville suck. They suck because they suck
*  Raiders home for the Panthers
*  So I thought about this
*  Don't know how the Panthers are getting less than seven points
*  Against anyone in the league that's not the Giants at this point
*  Because I was trying to think like if they play Washington is it I just don't see
*  Especially on the road, so I have Raiders by seven
*  You're gonna set a record for how many you got exactly that's exactly right. Yeah
*  Let me count how many you have because you won the week, but one two. I'm doing like the Michael Jordan three rugged magic or
*  Five
*  Albert the hey five exact picks six exact six exact picks
*  It's crazy when you powers what could happen when you're staring right at the fan the homepage. It's amazing the results
*  Sunday night Chiefs Falcons somehow we get the Falcons again. Mm-hmm
*  Yeah
*  So I guess Chiefs by three and a half my guess is if the Falcons suck tomorrow
*  This games in Atlanta by the way if the Falcons suck tomorrow this goes up, but three and a half seemed fair
*  Would you have this is Vegas own I had it at four. It's four and a half
*  But yeah, I mean really we have to see if Kirk Cousins can move
*  I mean Joe House made a compelling case about breaking down his
*  Various different types of passes with Kirk Cousins last week
*  Well, they had all these stats about how he used to run
*  Play action and it like just all the different ways that they basically made sure he didn't move
*  Yep, play action was a big one. Not great
*  well
*  Monday night is
*  They don't get divorced night for some reason. There's two games. I
*  Don't know why they decided to do this. I think I like it for the most part
*  Bill's Jaguars is the first game that's in Buffalo
*  I'm gonna not allow myself to bet on this game, but I have the bills by four and a half
*  I had it too and it's five and a half. I have four and a half also
*  Isn't the the second one the later one supposed to be the better one or no?
*  There's one's at 730 ones at 815 kickoff Jacksonville Buffalo's
*  730 Washington, I mean I would argue they would think they before the year
*  They probably thought both of these games were good because the other one Cincinnati, Washington with Jaden Daniels against Burrow LSU against LSU
*  right
*  You know if you had just toughed it out at ESPN you would be calling one of these games
*  Whichever the lesser. Yeah, if you just had toughed it out for a while
*  Whichever the lesser yeah, if you just had toughed it out for like more years, yeah, what's wrong with you?
*  I would have loved that I would have loved so sure MBA so short-sighted
*  Bengals
*  Minus five and a half was my last one. That's what I got to get swash them seven and a half
*  They kind of have to win that game
*  They kind of have to win it
*  That feels like the Houston game today that it's just gonna be in everybody's I gotta make my money back tease
*  yeah, that's why I stayed away from Houston tonight because I was like this is this seems too fishy and
*  You're almost turned out. They almost thought I didn't get it. Anyway. Alright, so I won week three. Oh, yeah, you crushed me
*  Yeah, Cincinnati. I
*  Had Washington as my best bet probably the law as lucky as I can get on that because Giants kicker doesn't go out
*  They win by default right so yeah, but I might I'm gonna take back all my Jaden Daniels praise for now
*  maybe it can be good but I
*  Mean, he looks like he looks like Michael Jackson the Billie Jean guy. I didn't realize how thin he is
*  Just run around back there really skinny. Yeah, crazy crazy stupid skinny
*  I don't after watching him take some of these heads said he's
*  Somebody that doesn't seem like he's built for a 17 game season playing the way he's playing that one hit he took it looked
*  Like he was gonna be done for four months
*  Yeah, we have we're forced to watch football differently now, but
*  You have to care about these guys. Just do well
*  Meanwhile Josh Allen's like LeBron like I don't even know what scenario he would even get hurt
*  You know, we said the joke about LeBron would his leg would come off and you just pick it up and go get it and put
*  On I don't I don't see a lot of Josh Allen like oh man what a hit he's always doling out the hit
*  Yeah, there you go. Bill's fans Simmons jinxed you if Josh Allen comes out next week. I like the Monday night
*  Those fans are cool. They did a good thing with two of this week
