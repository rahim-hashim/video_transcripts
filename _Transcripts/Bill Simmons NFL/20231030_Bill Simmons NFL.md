# Bill Simmons and Cousin Salâ€™s Worst NFL Quarterback Draft | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [October 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFPTwBJnTXI)
*  Okay.
*  So we're going to do a bad quarterback draft to commemorate how bad today was.
*  And you said this and I was like, I was like, oh, this is going to be easy.
*  And it is not easy.
*  This is tough.
*  So we're going to stick with, yeah, we're going to do five players.
*  We'll go back and forth.
*  You can have first pick and we're getting each have five guys.
*  Who is your first pick of the October 29th, 2023 bad quarterback
*  draft of guys we watched today?
*  I just need, I don't need clarification for this first pick, but every
*  pick after I'm going to need, it's tough.
*  Is this, is this who you don't like, if this guy can't lead you, your team
*  to a field goal, your family gets tied up and tossed into the Pacific ocean.
*  Like how are we ranking the, cause I wouldn't draft any of them on my team.
*  No, they, so we're going from worse to less.
*  All right.
*  It's got to be the sense of hopelessness for if you're rooting for the team or if
*  you bet on the team and it's third and six.
*  How hopeless you feel.
*  So you're going Tommy DeVito.
*  I have to, I think it's unfair that you gave me the first pick.
*  This is like the Adrian Peterson years, the Marshall Falk years of a draft
*  one, it's like, we should really do a, an auction draft because Tommy
*  DeVito can't throw a forward pass.
*  So, um, which I feel is important in 2023.
*  Um, he could throw like a screen and he could hand off, but I have no
*  confidence that he could, uh, forget your team downfield.
*  He can't throw a forward pass.
*  I'm probably going to get whacked for saying that, but Tommy DeVito is my pick.
*  So the Giants passing now is it was terrible weather, but the Giants pass
*  the day they were six for 14 for minus nine yards, it says, and Tommy
*  DeVito was two for seven for minus one.
*  Got sacked twice.
*  So I actually thought like that was some sort of accident or like the
*  ESPN.com thing stalled, but those were the actual stats.
*  Um, and this was an overtime game, which was even
*  better.
*  He had, he played at least, I don't know, two and a half quarters.
*  And they were just like, Tommy, you're not like at some point, if you're just
*  knocking them throw it all, like why not have Saquon Barkley just be the
*  quarterback just wild carded with
*  Barkley.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  I don't know what they were doing.
*  I don't know what day ball and I did predict that by very few good
*  predictions that come to fruition, the fans would turn on day ball.
*  And well, I guess we'll get more into that game, but we'll stick with the
*  draft for now.
*  Yeah.
*  Tommy DeVito is the first pick.
*  Now you get to, we're doing snake.
*  Oh, you want to go snake fashion?
*  That's it.
*  Well, I just feel bad that I got Tommy.
*  Well, we should, cause Tommy DeVito is a ridiculous, ridiculous value at
*  number one.
*  Um, so I'm going to take a Trubisky here.
*  I had the viewers.
*  Um, I was, I was excited about them, especially when the game unfolded where,
*  um, you know, it was just classic Steelers.
*  They were somehow in the game.
*  It was six, three.
*  They had like no first downs and two and two turnovers recovered.
*  And it was just, it had all the makings and then, um, pick it gets hurt.
*  And Trubisky comes in and I can just tell you how crestfallen I were.
*  I was when I saw him, he throws it up for grabs.
*  Like the one thing we said about Trubisky in the past was if he doesn't know
*  he's playing, sometimes he's okay.
*  Not the case today.
*  Not the right now.
*  There are some bad calls and the Pittsburgh was mad about after, but I just, I,
*  I've just completely given up on him.
*  I don't know what he does.
*  Well, I don't think he knows what he does.
*  Well, they don't really know.
*  He's not like a, they don't, he's not Josh Allen anymore.
*  He doesn't scramble out to the sides or anything.
*  He just is kind of this terrible pocket passer.
*  So he's my first pick.
*  Okay.
*  And, uh, and then I have to take, uh, this Jaren hall that came in for cousins.
*  Who is that guy?
*  Where did he come from?
*  It's almost unfair.
*  He the starter now?
*  No, they got to know.
*  But, well, I mean, don't you get, if this was a course, when you give him an NA, I
*  mean, he was three for four for 23 yards.
*  I know his QBR could need some work, like a 4.3 or whatever, but I know they
*  can't stick with them.
*  You're right to not have any confidence in them.
*  Who do you have with the fourth pick?
*  All right.
*  Wow.
*  Boy, there's so many, a lot of good people left on the board.
*  I'll go, I'll go Brett Rippon for one, not inspiring.
*  As soon as I saw, you know, 7.7 QBR came in against the Cowboys.
*  I wasn't scared at all.
*  It's like put, put Stafford in with a broken hand or whatever he has.
*  So he'll do better.
*  Yeah, but I've written comes in when you have the Cowboys defense and fantasy and
*  you're like, delighted.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  So that's it.
*  So do I get another one too?
*  Do I get a naked?
*  Yeah.
*  I'll tell you what, man.
*  I'm well, Dorian Thompson Robinson came in and threw a pass.
*  Does that count?
*  It was one for one.
*  You could have.
*  All right.
*  You got sick.
*  Okay.
*  All right.
*  He's that he stinks.
*  This is great.
*  We should do this every week.
*  Instead of ranking MVPs, we talk, Oh, it's it's my homes.
*  It's two.
*  We're like, no, we should do this.
*  So you have Dorian Thompson Robinson, really ballsy pick.
*  I like it.
*  Thank you.
*  Um, man, I, it's Zach Wilson.
*  Can't go lower than this.
*  I got to have them really, even though, um, even though he threw, he had, I, so I
*  turned that game off.
*  I didn't know what was, I didn't realize because the giants had the ball.
*  They were inside the 30 that had a three point lead.
*  It was under two minutes left and they're running.
*  And I'm just like, Oh, this is over.
*  They're going to run out the clock.
*  And then all of a sudden they cut in to the other game that like on the red
*  zone or something like 10, 10.
*  And I'm like, I don't even understand how they got it back.
*  So Wilson made one big play, but I still think he's terrible.
*  I mean, he, he 10 points seems like a miracle with him.
*  All right.
*  But wait a minute, at least he drove them down to a tying field goal.
*  Anyone you're not picking, you think could do that?
*  Maybe you're right.
*  Maybe it's not.
*  No, he's there.
*  And then, uh, PJ Walker is my other one.
*  Okay.
*  Not bad.
*  You know, well, I want to talk about that Brown's game in the next segment, but he
*  had three turnovers again and, uh, he just, he's just not functional.
*  He's, he's a 50% passer.
*  He has bad judgment.
*  There's drop passes with him.
*  He, uh, you know, he can do, he's a little like Dobbs.
*  He can do just enough to make you, to fool you into thinking the offense is moving.
*  But if you actually have money on him or you're ruining for him, but he's
*  just a nightmare, so he's my pick.
*  All right.
*  That's fair.
*  What do you got?
*  You got to, um, John who Smith threw a pass.
*  I won't count that.
*  You can't, we're not.
*  Okay.
*  He doesn't count.
*  Okay.
*  I get to, these are my last two.
*  This will be five.
*  Well, we might go, we might go two hours with this.
*  Yeah, I got to put Kenny Pickett in there.
*  He stinks.
*  He was 10 for 16 for 73 yards, but.
*  So it was like this in the middle of the second quarter that negative one yards
*  total, like he does this all the time.
*  This is ridiculous.
*  If he doesn't have an average defense, if he has an average defense, he's done.
*  I, he just, and we say it every week.
*  That's it.
*  I'm sorry.
*  The problem is he heats up in the last 10 minutes of the game, but he got hurt
*  before he had a chance to heat up.
*  He had the first play of the game.
*  I think it was Deontay Johnson just wide open over the middle.
*  And it looked like it would have been like a 40 yard pass and he overthrew him
*  and Johnson maybe could have called it in, but it was just, just why it was just
*  like, Oh, this is going to be another Kenny Pickett game.
*  But this is, he is, I'm telling you, it's redefining system quarterback.
*  Cause this is the only system he could be in where the Steelers team, they're
*  playing such good defense, they leave him good field position and he could
*  maybe put up some points.
*  You wouldn't want him for Mac Jones.
*  Right?
*  I mean, I'm not, no, I, I will say this makes me feel better about how high I
*  took Trubisky because I was actually bummed out when Kenny Pickett came out.
*  And I agreed.
*  This is the right range for him to get drafted.
*  All right.
*  Who's your next one?
*  I got one more.
*  I got one more.
*  All right.
*  Uh, can I take the veto again?
*  No.
*  Um, well Tyson Bajan's still out there.
*  Yeah.
*  I think we gave him too much, uh, too much credit.
*  Uh, you know what you take Tyson Bajan.
*  I'm going to take Desmond Ritter.
*  I'm sick of this guy too.
*  I'm going to take another starter.
*  You know, I speak ill of the guy.
*  I think he's in concussion protocol, but eight for 12 for 71.
*  And that's what the best we're going to get out of him.
*  Had three turnovers last week, three fumbles, two of them inside the one,
*  one inside the seven.
*  How many times do you have today?
*  One or two?
*  I think it was just one today.
*  Yeah.
*  He had a bad combo.
*  Okay.
*  All right.
*  So you have Ritter.
*  I am taking Tyson Bajan.
*  Okay.
*  And I'm taking Mack Jones and Mack Jones.
*  Honestly, it's, this is incredible value.
*  Classic Mack Jones today.
*  Is he a keeper?
*  Is he a keeper in your bed?
*  Yeah.
*  That corner over, you know, he looked pretty good last week.
*  He sucked all of us into thinking that, um, that Pat's game was sitting there for
*  them.
*  I don't know if they could have stolen it, but their defense was really good
*  today and they had a, that PI that they called on Tyree kill was just an
*  unbelievable, you know, just a, just a barely touch call did not match a lot of
*  the other stuff that happened.
*  Like they missed the helmet to helmet that got Devante Parker knocked out of
*  the game, but the Pats were hanging around there driving at the end.
*  They played the end of the second quarter perfectly.
*  Right.
*  It's like, my name is not going to get the ball back.
*  We're going to get a field goal or we're going to tie the game.
*  They're driving down and then he throws it right to Jaylen Ramsey.
*  And that ball was in the air for five seconds.
*  And it was the culmination of a bunch of shaky plays where it just like he loses
*  his, it's like watching a basketball player who can't make a three pointer.
*  He just loses his confidence.
*  Um, it was in the air for five seconds.
*  He just throwing 20 yard Hail Marys.
*  It would, it looked like a helium balloon.
*  Um, he's just, he makes three, four terrible throws a game.
*  They dropped a couple of picks from him today.
*  Um, they were, they were showing wide replays of like him taking sacks, but
*  there would be two guys open that he just wasn't thrown into for some reason.
*  Um, pretty brutal.
*  So anyway, I got Tyson Bajam, Mac Jones.
*  All right.
*  You want one more pick?
*  Yeah, I'll, I'll take, I'll just take one more.
*  I don't need to do the double here.
*  I don't think it's time for Dobbs.
*  I don't think it's time for Minchur just yet.
*  I mean, it would be easy to say Will Levis, but we could wait one week, I think,
*  before he comes back down to earth.
*  I'm going to say Jordan love giving up on Jordan love too.
*  24 for 41 to 29.
*  That's the best he's going to do a 17 QBR, 11 touchdowns, eight
*  interceptions on the year.
*  And it seems much worse when you watch him play.
*  It just seems much worse than those numbers.
*  I just read he's gotten worse every week.
*  And, uh, I was, I was very enticed potentially to bet on them today.
*  And he was the reason I didn't bet on them.
*  It's not just him though.
*  That is, that might be the worst coach team in the league now.
*  Yeah.
*  I think they had eight penalties in the first half, but they just like, they,
*  they look like they have in practice.
*  They're just a mess.
*  And it's not like they don't have talent.
*  I know they lost their left tackle, but they do have, you know, somewhat, it
*  shouldn't be this hard for them to move the ball downfield and score.
*  They're playing the fucking Vikings.
*  Maybe we do worst coach next week.
*  Draft.
*  Oh, where's coach would be really fun.
*  All right.
*  So guys who didn't get picked, Sam Howell, Josh Dobbs, Russell Wilson,
*  um, Bryce young and we'll love us who shouldn't have been picked
*  because he was really good today.
*  So there we go.
*  All right.
*  Sal's team is DeVito.
*  I like it love Ritter, Rippen, Dorian Thompson Robinson.
*  You kind of cheated with that one and Kenny Pickett.
*  And then I have Zach Wilson, PJ Walker, Mac Jones, Tyson, Bajan,
*  Trubisky and Jaren Hall.
*  So we'll have to put those on social and we'll have the, we'll have everybody vote
*  and see who has the better, bad quarterback team.
