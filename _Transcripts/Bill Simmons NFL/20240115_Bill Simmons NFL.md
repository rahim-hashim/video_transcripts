# Whatâ€™s Next for Dak, McCarthy, and the Cowboys? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [January 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Lh4Pxp9SEA)
*  Sal I watched him go through the seven stages of I can't believe this has happened to me again. It wasn't even grief
*  What was it you haven't watched with me like the lose in a while, right?
*  No, this one was bad because I felt like you had high hopes, but you're also your guard was up
*  You're in a weird even start of the day. I felt like you were gonna sit right
*  I think I stood for most of the three hours. I moved around
*  We tried a bunch of things five different locations in the big room
*  You gave me a Roddy Piper glass from my diet coke. We thought that would change the fortune
*  They just suck man. They sucked. I thought about driving home. I'm like I'll do the podcast from home
*  I don't need these people them dropping f-bombs all day. I'm an immature jerk and
*  But they sucked I hated it
*  So we will talk about all the games normally we would talk about the last game of the day
*  But the Cowboys thing we all went in a bill Belichick
*  Jim Harbaugh Mike variable mode. What was it halfway through the second quarter?
*  I took an Instagram was the first time it got mentioned, but that's clearly gonna be it for McCarthy
*  Dak is now two and five and playoff games
*  Jones I think is five and five and twelve since the last Super Bowl in the playoffs Aaron Jones
*  Jerry Jones teams that he's owned and and this was especially embarrassing because
*  Their defense got absolutely crushed by QB who had never been there before a Packers team that was young and dumb
*  Mm-hmm, but in a good way and just went up and down the field on him that ended up with 403 yards
*  Oh, that was fun. Yeah, that was stupid
*  I I know I wish I can get mad at wish I get mad at the refs or just one thing
*  But the defense was so bad that I don't even know if that was good if it mattered
*  But he was really bad. He looked all out of sorts even in the beginning
*  Sailing passes to CD lamb
*  He was way off and and locking in on him and you always do that whoever the first receiver was
*  He was just staring him down and throwing it to him right lamb was mad at him like almost immediately
*  We didn't know what was going with that
*  I was kind of stunned because I know he has trouble with two deep safeties
*  But that's like when the Niners play that right when you're playing the Packers and like this 24th ranked pass defense
*  Yeah, we're a banged up Jair Alexander and like their second or third corner the guy covering
*  Michael Gallup is like a practice squad guy and they couldn't figure it out for hours and just made me sick
*  How are they not passing all over this team and it was it was weird for me because I'm just getting texts from people
*  Being like you're with Sal right? How's he doing? There was like two hours left in the game. Yeah, right
*  She's still in the house or do you leave?
*  People just get your welfare told me to leave you should have now as a friend
*  Listen, there was nothing worse than what we witnessed yesterday with JJ during that Dolphins game
*  I mean he took that way harder. You've at least one Super Bowls that you can remember in your life. Yeah
*  Yeah, now JJ has the longest the longest route for a playoff winless team
*  But yeah, I don't know what to say like that McCarthy
*  I actually think like Quinn was worse like as a coach and he's gonna get a job
*  I hate that McCarthy didn't have them ready in a game that like should mean his job as you say and
*  Whatever's left of his legacy. Yeah gets his Packers team, but uh, it sucked. It really did
*  Yeah, maybe you're better off just throwing that last week of the season away and playing at Tampa
*  Oh, so we might have done this right? Yeah, so we might have they could get assuming they did it intentionally
*  They better get it right could get two home games. Oh, no, like no, no the Rams lost. Okay, one homie
*  Well, I was trying to think of tough week for dot dot dot
*  Tough week for deck. Yeah turn he's 30 years old right now
*  Kind of are who you are as a QB at this point. We've seen him look really I this is the best year he's had
*  I don't totally trust him in big games like this
*  I thought his eyes turned into saucers basically halfway through the first quarter
*  And this is a game like if you're a really elite franchise guy, you're like, alright guys our defense can't stop us
*  Let's go get some points. It went the other way tough week for deck, but you have to pay him, right?
*  Yeah, definitely one more year
*  How you feeling about that one more year and then probably an extension if you're going to do it would be this summer
*  probably it's 29 million dollars and
*  Yeah, it's funny you mentioned JJ big Dolphins fan we watched with him
*  I feel like I'm in the same boat as he is as Dolphins fans are you have between Dak and to a to top 10 quarterbacks, right?
*  Not really gonna argue with that regular season top 10 regular season top 10 quarterbacks. All right. So what do you do?
*  Do you look to move on for them? First of all, I don't even know if we get a second rounder for Dak at this point
*  With the one year left and if you do move on from them, you're now putting yourself in that pool
*  You know where 70% of GM's fail picking up one of these quarterbacks, yeah drafting them so kind of stuff
*  we can't do that with the team you have I would say you probably blame the coach and
*  You know the
*  That you had a digs went out so you can look at that say like me. Maybe there's part of it
*  Gilmore was hurt. So that was your second best corner back
*  It doesn't explain the lack of a pass rush
*  The fact that Parsons we were talking about it during the during the game
*  Parsons has become like the new girl. He just gets manhandled every they never call anything
*  They show replays just two guys. I'm like an innocent bystander. I don't I actually probably know
*  You're not that in no, but I'm like even I'm like, whoa Parsons
*  Like why does he get officiated his head is snapped back every play
*  In fact the helmet all the time they have to drop him in coverage a few plays and I'm like that's ridiculous
*  That's just to give him a rest I think that's yeah give him a rest without actually giving him a rest
*  But yeah, that defense was bad, but let's give it to Jordan love. He was I was gonna say tough week for Rogers
*  Great. I mean
*  For all kinds of reasons then on top of it
*  This green bay thing happens is pick that he hated and the guy played better in that playoff game
*  Then Rogers has probably played the last five years in the playoffs
*  I agree Rogers again with another with his comments another subpar January
*  But Jordan love hottest quarterback in football coming in 20 I did worry about that a little yeah
*  21 touchdowns three interceptions in like the last seven weeks perfect passer rating today
*  You know, he's gonna be great and he kind of looked like Rogers, right?
*  He back footing stuff. Yeah side armor side arm stuff waiting as long as he could moving around
*  He had a couple awesome throws where he took big hits
*  Right and caught the guy in stride and just made like honestly a couple wow place
*  There were guys wide open 25 yards down the field in the same spot like three times in a row
*  It was it was disgusting, but he's um, he's pretty damn good
*  I mean whatever he could also grow a weird creepster mustache and you know sling some
*  Conspiracy theories and those inaccurate statements. Yeah slanderous stuff. Yeah, who knows but I don't know tough week for Mike McCarthy
*  who
*  One of the headlines today was Prescott backs McCarthy. How'd you feel about that?
*  I
*  Hear that can I back neither of them? Yeah, I don't know
*  I'm sure I think what the equivalent is of two guys who might be on their way out backing each other
*  So you really think that might be on his way out?
*  No, I was trying to look at what I'm reading and I was reading all the nonsense
*  But what could we get from a second round there and you take a cap it too, right?
*  Yeah, and we take the cap it so it's not good. It's easier to get rid of McCarthy
*  I know you have plans for him. I know you're walking through the neighborhood
*  I passed 63 mansions and I come up with Belichick to the Cowboys
*  I don't think I don't think that's the answer
*  Tell me why you think it's perfect and I'll tell you don't think Belichick's the answer
*  I don't want them and I don't think it's gonna happen either
*  Would he have done a better job than Mike McCarthy today? I'm gonna say did would your defense have gotten torched by Jordan love?
*  Probably not. All right. Okay. I just think
*  Belichick the more intel we get he wants to break that record
*  Sure the wicker sham
*  Right tops the piece was pretty interesting. But you go to Dallas
*  Probably 11 to 12 wins two years in a row
*  I think it's the sexy move for Jones really right?
*  It's like hey, you know the McCarty but I just got the greatest coach of all time and we have won a Super Bowl in
*  Three decades and now Bill Belichick. We need each other. This is gonna be great turning the team over to him
*  He's in control of all the coaching stuff, you know, we're here we have all system and if you're Belichick
*  Like it's just the safest bet of all these available jobs. Hmm, like Atlanta. I don't have a QB
*  Carolina chargers like you go through them and this is it's either this or if Buffalo shits the bed tomorrow. Yeah, right
*  Well, all right. First thing here's why I don't think it works for Dallas
*  First of all, and maybe this works in his favor. We have Intel like he doesn't like Bob Kraft Jerry Jones
*  So is this would this be an effort?
*  I mean, they're supposed to be friends, but it's like one of those that but if he brings them on is this an FU to
*  Him or is that like no, I don't want your damaged goods
*  So I said the shaker brought this up on Thursday and I just think these super rich guys
*  They actually kind of like swinging their dicks and hit the other guy in the head. Yeah and being like, yeah, fuck you
*  I heard you okay
*  I would think Jerry would talk about swinging his dick and hitting everybody that he'd be psyched to be able to swing his dick
*  I think at this point least some kind of interview
*  Secondly though, but if he wants to be a GM, there's no way Jerry's gonna let him do that
*  But maybe he just comes in it's like hey, you're just gonna coach the team. We have a whole thing here
*  Here's 20 million dollars a year. All right, and you can coach
*  the most famous franchise
*  In any sport other than maybe the Yankees. So the Cowboys one or two. I put them one
*  Although they might have lost the fan today
*  But the move is to hire back variable
*  Yeah, it's like these smart things better, but I don't know if that's the Jerry Jones move the Jerry Jones movies
*  He's I'm in my 80s. I want to win now the greatest coach ever is available. I have a quarterback
*  I have a team. I have a defense that underperformed. I'll spend whatever it takes
*  This guy's as motivated as I am you tuck yourself into that pretty fast
*  I just think he took it took 25 years for him to put Jimmy Johnson a headstrong type-a personality in the ring of honor
*  He's gonna yeah take flack from
*  Belichick the last couple years. The other thing is he proved on your team Belichick. He can't win with shitty quarterbacks. Oh
*  It's bad
*  I didn't know what you were doing there for a second. You said Atlanta for Belichick. I think that's the answer
*  I think you can get ten wins with it man
*  I think it's Atlanta if I know I can get her cousins or somebody who's at least that's the threat
*  I think Minshew and above yeah, we said it's the Minshew line
*  Yeah
*  The Minshew Minshew couldn't win you ten games and then you watch Houston yesterday and you think maybe
*  Indianapolis and Minshew was a little better than we thought there was some cause-and-effect stuff that you know
*  We always end up doing after the fact but even Green Bay when they beat Detroit on Thanksgiving and that seemed like such a bad loss
*  For Detroit right now. It doesn't seem as bad because you know, Green Bay has been coming on here for seven eight weeks
*  He had that kind of game. Yeah, I did so and then Detroit looks a little better today
*  So who do you want as the coach you gotta tell us? I don't know. I haven't even gotten that far
*  I'm just so mad about the guy a variable out of those three. I would say right not
*  Harbaugh you wouldn't know I think Harbaugh Harbaugh doesn't get a lot. He doesn't even talk to the AD there at Michigan
*  I think he's like behind the scenes
*  He he sours on these guys pretty quickly and vice versa
*  But Belichick to Atlanta like people say to the Chargers you got Justin Herbert. You're gonna win games
*  You have my Holmes in that division so I like that I like it it's a blackjack, right so if you put
*  Belichick on the Chargers you have a nine against a picture card
*  You have 19 against a picture card if you put Belichick on the Falcons, I would say that's more like a seven a seven
*  Yeah, all right
*  If you're because they're and they have all these salary cap issues the Chargers if you put them on the Falcons you have a 15
*  Against a six I think right
*  Yeah, that's it you worried about Carolina who's the disaster
*  Tampa well, I don't know what they are and then Saints to and then Saints is like that. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense
*  You just need the QB. I
*  Brave all is the one that makes the most sense, but then he's in another situation where he's beholden to some owner
*  But free balls like his age like that's somebody he could be the Cowboys coach for by the time Jones is dead
*  Whatever that is exactly like 20 years 35 years 35 years from now
*  These are all the Dak Prescott games
*  Playoffs sounded like you were moving on to the another game. Well, they lost a Green Bay by three in 2017, right?
*  they lost they beat Seattle by two and
*  Then lost to the Rams in 2019. I was at that game little dissatisfied on the ground. Yep. They lost the Niners in
*  2022
*  January then they beat Tampa last year knock Brady out of the game for good a
*  Pretty bad Tampa team and then lost to the Niners and scored 12 points
*  And then this was the first time he really got blown out in a playoff game. Yeah, so deep down
*  Yeah, I mean you did name your kid Jack Romo Iacono. You did like it. It's like a slight vindication
*  Yeah, that's but he's not doing better than Romo did as I do wonder
*  I'm on a bunch of text chains as you imagine we talked in one of them if they would have if Jerry
*  Looking back would have allowed Romo
*  Would have insisted Romo
*  Stay in the lineup when back was so good that at least for just for one year to have it
*  But in my mind, I like to think
