# Million-Dollar Picks Week 1 With Joe House | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac)
*  Million dollar picks, week one, as always, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=0.0s)]
*  presented by Fandil, brought in my buddy Joe House [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=3.84s)]
*  as the conciliar this year. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=7.28s)]
*  I like having people to bounce my bets off. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=8.64s)]
*  The funny thing about this job, House, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=11.24s)]
*  I'll send you packing after three weeks [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  if it's not working out. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=15.92s)]
*  I don't care if we've been friends for 36 years. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=16.88s)]
*  If it's not working, it's not working. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=19.16s)]
*  I go where the green is for million dollar picks. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=20.72s)]
*  Are you psyched? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=23.26s)]
*  Are you ready to roll? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=24.1s)]
*  How you feeling? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=24.98s)]
*  Well, you've sent me packing before, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=25.98s)]
*  so it's not like anything that I wouldn't be used to. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=27.92s)]
*  I'm pumped, I'm ready. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=31.28s)]
*  I mean, we're coming off of a banner season last year. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=32.84s)]
*  On our weekly picks pool that we do on ESPN, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=36.400000000000006s)]
*  I did kind of dominate. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=40.24s)]
*  I did finish like 40 games above 500 [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=42.14s)]
*  against the spread last year. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=45.3s)]
*  So I'm ready to do my part here. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  And I had a big, big hot stretch [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=50.32000000000001s)]
*  on million dollar picks last year [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  after really hitting rock bottom. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=54.32000000000001s)]
*  And I looked in the mayor house [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=56.24s)]
*  and I said, you know, instead of blaming other people, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=58.5s)]
*  blaming quarterbacks, coaches, bad lines, stupid, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=60.5s)]
*  I gotta look in the mayor. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=64.86s)]
*  Maybe it's me. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=66.14s)]
*  What can I do more? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=67.02s)]
*  What's wrong with my process? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  And I had a really strong last 10 weeks in the playoffs. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=69.62s)]
*  And one thing that we've noticed over the last few years [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=72.7s)]
*  is you and I tend to gravitate toward [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=74.86s)]
*  the same types of teams and bets that we like. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=77.22s)]
*  So we're gonna run through a whole bunch of these. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=80.69999999999999s)]
*  We're gonna try to do groups. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=83.58s)]
*  And the first group is stayaways. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=86.66s)]
*  So these bets are not gonna come up. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=88.25999999999999s)]
*  And feel free to stop me at any point of these. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=90.22s)]
*  But these are just ones that I looked at, I didn't like. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=92.46s)]
*  It's too early. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=95.3s)]
*  I wanna see the team for a week. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=96.14s)]
*  The line's fishy. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=97.62s)]
*  Dallas, Cleveland. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=99.17999999999999s)]
*  I just wanna watch both teams. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=101.25999999999999s)]
*  I wanna see what's up with Deshaun. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=102.94s)]
*  Don't you feel the same? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=104.42s)]
*  I know you like Cleveland a little bit, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=105.25999999999999s)]
*  but I just don't wanna bet on Deshaun in week one. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=107.25999999999999s)]
*  So I did bet on Cleveland and Deshaun for week one, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=109.69999999999999s)]
*  but it was early in the summer [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=113.7s)]
*  when Cleveland was getting points at home. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=116.06s)]
*  Dallas was the favorite. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=119.44s)]
*  That line has flipped and Cleveland is now favored [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=120.42s)]
*  by I think a full two points. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  So I like being on the right side of that proposition. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=125.14s)]
*  Well, you can hedge it the other way. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=127.66s)]
*  I'm sure we'll screw up the hedge. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=129.06s)]
*  We always screw up the hedges. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=130.82s)]
*  So I'm staying away from that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=132.14000000000001s)]
*  The pass rush against that Dallas offensive line, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=133.7s)]
*  which is the worst offensive line, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=138.06s)]
*  I think since Dak has been there, that's what I like. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=139.54s)]
*  I like that Cleveland pass rush at home. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=142.3s)]
*  Colts, Texans, I love the Texans this year. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=144.5s)]
*  This line is a suspicious two and a half [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=147.14000000000001s)]
*  and I'm staying away. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=149.8s)]
*  I feel like I have too much invested in the Texans. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=151.74s)]
*  It's a revenge game for the Colts. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=154.5s)]
*  Richardson's all over the map. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=156.46s)]
*  I don't know what to make him stay away. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=157.78s)]
*  Bears, Titans, I wanna watch both teams for a week. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=159.94s)]
*  Do you have a sway on this one either way or no? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=163.86s)]
*  I think the line is too high. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=167.60000000000002s)]
*  I don't know why the Titans are getting four and a half. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=169.38s)]
*  I would be fine if it was Chicago by three or two and a half. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=173.54s)]
*  It feels like it should be three and a half. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=176.86s)]
*  It feels stay-a-wish. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=179.34s)]
*  Bucks, Washington is a game you like. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=181.1s)]
*  Washington's getting three and a half in Tampa [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=182.74s)]
*  and you don't understand why the line is that high. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=185.68s)]
*  I have some answers. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=188.22s)]
*  Everything is new on the Washington side. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=190.34s)]
*  I don't know what you're getting with the, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=192.34s)]
*  we should mention Washington's your favorite team. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=194.14000000000001s)]
*  The Washington defense, I wanna see how bad it is [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=196.1s)]
*  for a week. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=198.22s)]
*  Tampa's got a little nobody believes in us [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=199.34s)]
*  where it's just they made the playoffs last year [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=201.7s)]
*  and everybody's kicked them in the curb. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=203.38s)]
*  It's a stay away from me. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=205.38s)]
*  You like DC just a little bit here, right? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=206.46s)]
*  Tiny bit. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=209.5s)]
*  I'm not gambling on that game. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=210.34s)]
*  I too, I just wanna watch it and enjoy it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=212.3s)]
*  I wanna watch Jayden Daniels do his thing. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=214.46s)]
*  I wanna see some semblance of organization, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=217.9s)]
*  some semblance of discipline, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=221.1s)]
*  getting rid of all the dumb penalties [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=222.78s)]
*  and the dumb mistakes that I had to live with [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=224.54s)]
*  the last 20 years. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=226.42s)]
*  Come on Dan Quinn, let's go baby. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=227.9s)]
*  Well you've done, and I've known you a long fucking time. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=229.82000000000002s)]
*  You've done something very interesting [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=233.62s)]
*  with this Washington team. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=234.94000000000003s)]
*  Like we've been in fantasy drafts. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=236.22000000000003s)]
*  You didn't wanna go near Jayden Daniels. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=238.36s)]
*  You have a lot of eggs in the basket [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=241.94s)]
*  and you're shockingly optimistic for somebody who's, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=243.9s)]
*  you've been very honest about Alex Sarr. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=247.26000000000002s)]
*  When the wizards will take weird draft picks, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=251.46s)]
*  you're just like immediately like, I don't trust this. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=253.94s)]
*  But with Daniels, you've been very coy. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=257.88s)]
*  I feel like you're way, way in on this [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=259.56s)]
*  and you just don't wanna admit it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=261.48s)]
*  Well it's not the admit part, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=263.40000000000003s)]
*  it's the superstition aspect of it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  Like the last time that we had a quarterback [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  with these credentials, a lot of similarities [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=270.28000000000003s)]
*  to a very exciting electric player [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=273.0s)]
*  who could do things with his legs. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  And honestly, Jayden Daniels throws the ball as a rookie [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=277.64s)]
*  better than RG3 could throw the ball as a rookie. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=281.52s)]
*  So I'm very over the top for Jayden Daniels [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=285.12s)]
*  but I want my optimism to be guarded [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=288.4s)]
*  because I need my guard up as a Washington fan. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=290.56s)]
*  You know, it's, you've been hurt. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  That's what it says. I've been hurt. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=296.24s)]
*  True story, Dan Snyder. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=297.52s)]
*  You've had some bad sports relationships. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=299.12s)]
*  Oh, Vetchkin worked out. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=301.04s)]
*  That was a win. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=302.44s)]
*  He did, congratulations. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=303.56s)]
*  And he's gonna get that record. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=304.92s)]
*  There you go, you had one thing work out. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=305.76s)]
*  Saints Panthers, that line's moving toward the Panthers. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=307.44s)]
*  It's now three and a half. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=309.96s)]
*  I think we all like the Panthers. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=311.0s)]
*  I don't think anyone likes the Saints [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  but that's now I'm staying the fuck away from that. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=313.6s)]
*  Fine. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=316.20000000000005s)]
*  Seattle, Denver. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  We all love Seattle. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=320.36s)]
*  I'm a tiny bit scared of Denver [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=323.16s)]
*  with this Bo Nix and Peyton [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=324.68s)]
*  and they feel like a live dog to me. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  A lot of people are running on Seattle, including me. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=328.96000000000004s)]
*  I have them in multiple bets. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=330.68s)]
*  That line's five and a half. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=331.92s)]
*  It's in the Vegas zone. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=333.04s)]
*  Half of me wants to parlay Seattle [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=334.76000000000005s)]
*  and put them with another team [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=336.6s)]
*  but I think I just wanna watch that one. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=338.24s)]
*  Do you have a feel either way? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=340.16s)]
*  For sure I'll be looking for ways [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=342.04s)]
*  to play Seattle on the money line. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=343.6s)]
*  Now you're even giving me more conviction. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=346.84000000000003s)]
*  It's just Denver goes up seven nothing [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=348.84000000000003s)]
*  and Gino, I'm staying away. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=351.96000000000004s)]
*  I just wanna watch it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=353.40000000000003s)]
*  The problem with Seattle is the offensive line. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=354.24s)]
*  I'm all the way in on every other aspect of Seattle [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=355.96000000000004s)]
*  but that offensive line is a TBD to be determined. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=359.08000000000004s)]
*  So let's see it, let's see it first. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  And you talked on East Coast Bias [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=365.20000000000005s)]
*  about the Bo Nix, Rookie of the Year odds and who knows? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=366.8s)]
*  Everybody's just, Caleb is basically even odds [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=372.36s)]
*  for Rookie of the Year. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=375.24s)]
*  Your guy's six to one. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=376.08000000000004s)]
*  Harrison is getting drafted, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=377.32s)]
*  the highest I've ever seen a rookie get drafted [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=378.8s)]
*  in fantasy drafts. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=380.96000000000004s)]
*  I was in three in the last three days. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=381.8s)]
*  Bo Nix, who's like 25, who was in college for 100 years, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=383.92s)]
*  he's got Sean Payne. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=387.6s)]
*  I wanna watch that for a week. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=389.16s)]
*  Now this last one was the final cut for us [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=390.20000000000005s)]
*  for Million Dollar Picks and it's a bet you like a lot. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=393.44s)]
*  It's the Vikings and the Giants. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=396.68s)]
*  It's a home game for the Giants. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=400.2s)]
*  They are somehow underdogs. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=402.68s)]
*  And I heard you say this on East Coast Bias, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=405.76s)]
*  you like the Giants. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=407.47999999999996s)]
*  I'm just telling you on Million Dollar Picks, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=408.56s)]
*  we don't bet two terrible teams against each other. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=410.44s)]
*  You could do that on your own time, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=413.03999999999996s)]
*  you could do it on an East Coast Bias. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=414.59999999999997s)]
*  But you were pretty compelled by the Giants. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=416.59999999999997s)]
*  So what was it? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=418.68s)]
*  Well, the case is basically Sam Darnold on the road [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=420.08s)]
*  and there is this undercurrent of thought [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=424.84s)]
*  that Sam Darnold with Shanahan was able to, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=429.08s)]
*  cause he was the backup in San Francisco, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=433.47999999999996s)]
*  was able to address some of the things [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=435.64s)]
*  that was holding him back. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=438.0s)]
*  But he is dreadful under every kind of situation and scenario. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=439.24s)]
*  So really it was just the idea of the best aspect [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=444.68s)]
*  of the Giants is their ability to put pressure upfront. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=449.15999999999997s)]
*  And Sam Darnold under duress, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=452.96s)]
*  even with all the weapons that he has, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=456.68s)]
*  I just liked the idea of it [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=460.04s)]
*  when it's basically a coin flip game and Giants at home, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=461.28000000000003s)]
*  that was the reason for it. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=464.92s)]
*  Giants feel like a half time bet to me against bad teams [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=467.40000000000003s)]
*  where if they have a lead, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=470.72s)]
*  then I kind of trust their defense and their pass rush, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=472.44s)]
*  maybe to bring the lead home. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=474.96000000000004s)]
*  But I can't bet on Danny Dimes and to me it's a stable. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=476.84000000000003s)]
*  I don't blame you. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=481.84000000000003s)]
*  It's a stable. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=482.68s)]
*  I don't blame you. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=483.52000000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=484.36s)]
*  Let's go to the bets we actually do like. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=485.20000000000005s)]
*  So we do a lot of our picks. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=487.12s)]
*  The format is this. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=487.91999999999996s)]
*  We put a assigned number, it's fake money. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=489.96s)]
*  We use the fan dual line. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=493.68s)]
*  It is? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=494.8s)]
*  Well, as far as the people know, it's fake money. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=496.4s)]
*  But we do, and when I've gotten into trouble [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=498.68s)]
*  and I went back and I looked at some of the years [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=502.32s)]
*  and especially in some of the times I get in trouble [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=504.64s)]
*  and I'm doing parlays and just one team will screw up [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=506.08s)]
*  like two, three bets for me. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=509.91999999999996s)]
*  So we're gonna try to keep them more straight up this year. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=511.2s)]
*  There is a really fun fan dual wrinkle [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=514.3199999999999s)]
*  that we're gonna get to for week one [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=516.4s)]
*  where you can double your winnings. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=517.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=519.52s)]
*  On any money line bet. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=520.36s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=521.64s)]
*  So any money line bet and it could be, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=522.48s)]
*  that could be favored, that could be underdogs. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=524.4s)]
*  You just get to double whatever you want on it. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=526.52s)]
*  We're gonna be exercising that one. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=528.48s)]
*  Use their 100% money line profit boost token. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=530.5600000000001s)]
*  The games that we like. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=534.6s)]
*  So we'll start with a tease. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=536.32s)]
*  This is the only tease we have. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=538.12s)]
*  I thought we'd only do one tease or parlay. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=539.28s)]
*  You just got through saying that the exotics. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=541.76s)]
*  This is it. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=544.0s)]
*  That you got yourself in trouble. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=545.0s)]
*  We're kicking off with a tease. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=546.76s)]
*  One exotic. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=548.1600000000001s)]
*  The reason I'm kicking it off is it's the Friday night game. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=549.0s)]
*  It's this weird Brazil game. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=551.44s)]
*  Great. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=553.0400000000001s)]
*  But the Packers line which is two and a half [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=554.44s)]
*  against the Eagles, neutral field, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=556.44s)]
*  which is weird because I think just about everybody [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=558.24s)]
*  likes the Packers more than the Eagles, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=560.88s)]
*  including me, including you. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=562.48s)]
*  So they're getting two and a half. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=564.44s)]
*  You can tease that up to eight and a half on a six pointer [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=565.64s)]
*  and that allows us to then take the Bengals [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=568.32s)]
*  who are minus eight, minus eight and a half. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=571.2s)]
*  It's somewhere in between those. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=573.32s)]
*  It's been bouncing around. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=574.92s)]
*  Take the Bengals under three against the Patriots. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=575.88s)]
*  A team that for some reason people just won't accept [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=578.4s)]
*  that this Patriots team is gonna be terrible, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=582.1999999999999s)]
*  that they can't block, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=584.0s)]
*  that they have the worst quarterback in the league. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=585.16s)]
*  I have no idea if their coach can even be a mediocre coach [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=587.1999999999999s)]
*  much less a not great one. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=589.84s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=591.88s)]
*  Did you just say they have the worst quarterback [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=592.72s)]
*  in the league? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=593.54s)]
*  You think Jacoby Brissett's the worst quarterback [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=594.56s)]
*  in the NFL? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=596.4s)]
*  Who's worse than him? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=597.24s)]
*  I mean, did you watch Bryce Young last year? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=598.68s)]
*  Would you rather have Bryce Young or Jacoby Brissett? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=601.24s)]
*  Well, you're doing franchise building. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=603.04s)]
*  Just for right now, this year. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=605.4399999999999s)]
*  This year. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=607.28s)]
*  You'd rather have Jacoby Brissett? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=608.12s)]
*  I don't, what's the case for Bryce Young? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=610.0s)]
*  What's the case for Jacoby Brissett? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=612.16s)]
*  Do you know in the 2020s, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=613.92s)]
*  his career record is six and 10? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=616.12s)]
*  This is for the decade. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=618.06s)]
*  He's 18 and 30 for his career [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=619.76s)]
*  and I think he's a nice backup. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=621.64s)]
*  You wanna know Bryce Young's career record? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=624.0s)]
*  Bryce Young's career record is bad. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=626.3199999999999s)]
*  All right, well he's fine. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=628.4s)]
*  He's in the conversation for worst quarterback in the league. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=629.76s)]
*  And then their front four, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=632.72s)]
*  which I think actually would have been good [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=634.36s)]
*  with Barmer and Judah. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=635.6800000000001s)]
*  Both those guys are gone. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=636.6800000000001s)]
*  And the Bengals chases coming back. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=637.88s)]
*  But have you noticed there's been some buzz [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=640.1600000000001s)]
*  on the Bengals side? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=642.2800000000001s)]
*  That line was down to seven and a half at one point. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=643.8000000000001s)]
*  Now it's back at eight and a half. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=646.32s)]
*  So Packers plus eight and a half, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=648.5600000000001s)]
*  Bengals minus two and a half [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=650.8000000000001s)]
*  is the first one I have circled. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=653.72s)]
*  Talk me out of it. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=655.36s)]
*  I'm not going to. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=657.1600000000001s)]
*  I think the Packers leg is especially compelling. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=658.9s)]
*  I hate this game. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=663.14s)]
*  I hate this game being in Brazil. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=664.14s)]
*  The Eagles are losing a home game [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=667.1s)]
*  against somebody that they're going to be competing with [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=669.34s)]
*  for one of the top seeds in the NFC. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=672.92s)]
*  I think it's bogus. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=676.18s)]
*  And I don't know why the NFL chose Brazil. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=677.18s)]
*  Like not great stuff happening there [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=680.66s)]
*  really since the Olympics. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=684.38s)]
*  But set aside the socio-political aspect. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=686.14s)]
*  I didn't realize. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=689.78s)]
*  I didn't realize we were on cable news. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=690.78s)]
*  10 hours away. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=693.9399999999999s)]
*  No, it's ridiculous. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=695.42s)]
*  They'll take a check from anybody. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=696.5s)]
*  That's what I said last week's pod. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=698.54s)]
*  I just feel like Saudi Arabia is in play or Abu Dhabi. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=701.02s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=704.66s)]
*  Goodell will take a check from literally anyone. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=705.5s)]
*  I think you're right. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=707.42s)]
*  But handicap wise, you and I are in agreement. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=708.3s)]
*  I think the Eagles and the Packers are close. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=711.52s)]
*  So getting any kind of points on the Packers side [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=715.42s)]
*  is positive to me. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=719.5s)]
*  The big unknowns for both teams are their defenses. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=720.54s)]
*  Both teams with new defensive coordinators. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=724.78s)]
*  And especially the secondaries because the... [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=727.58s)]
*  Well the Eagles, I would say is... [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=732.14s)]
*  Yeah, the Eagles I'm a little more worried about [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=734.38s)]
*  from a past secondary standpoint. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=736.34s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=738.62s)]
*  I could see a bunch of snares in this game [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=739.46s)]
*  and none of them are the Packers losing by double digits. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=741.54s)]
*  I could see them blowing out the Eagles [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=745.38s)]
*  and us being like, holy shit, the Eagles, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=746.58s)]
*  whoa, where's this going? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=748.4200000000001s)]
*  And I could see a really close game. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=750.5400000000001s)]
*  It feels like a one score game to me. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=751.82s)]
*  So we'll grab... [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=753.38s)]
*  Well I do like on the Eagles side, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=754.22s)]
*  all of that offensive weaponry [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=757.5s)]
*  that they bring to the table. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=759.5400000000001s)]
*  I love Saquon, you know, Saquon. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=760.5400000000001s)]
*  That's what you're calling him now? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=762.98s)]
*  Saquon D's nuts. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=764.3000000000001s)]
*  Yes, I am. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=765.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=766.98s)]
*  Here we go baby. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=768.6600000000001s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=769.9000000000001s)]
*  Million dollar, Dicks, here we go. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=770.74s)]
*  We graduated from college in 1992. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=771.58s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=774.02s)]
*  Boom. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=774.86s)]
*  All right, so T's Packers plus eight and a half Bengals [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=776.34s)]
*  minus two and a half. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=778.9s)]
*  We are gonna bold that one. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=780.38s)]
*  Next one. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=783.14s)]
*  Well, we're cheating [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=784.54s)]
*  because I know you love this as do I, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=785.74s)]
*  but the Jaguars are Miami. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=787.3000000000001s)]
*  I've already violated one rule [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=790.54s)]
*  is that I didn't want to go overseas with any bets. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=791.94s)]
*  And if we lose that Packers, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=794.26s)]
*  if the Packers lose by like 20, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=795.66s)]
*  I am done with overseas betting on million dollars picks. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=797.14s)]
*  This is my little tester. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=799.86s)]
*  Another one I don't love is betting on these games [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=801.5s)]
*  when it's potentially gonna be super hot or humid [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=804.1s)]
*  in Florida or Carolina. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=807.46s)]
*  I just, we've seen those games go sideways [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=809.1s)]
*  over and over again. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=812.1s)]
*  With that said, a Jaguars team that I really like [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=813.98s)]
*  that I think is gonna make the playoffs, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=817.14s)]
*  a Miami's team that I don't really like [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=818.58s)]
*  that I don't think is gonna make the playoffs. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=820.4200000000001s)]
*  And then you look at Miami, no Chubb, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=823.14s)]
*  Noah, that Beckham, left guards out, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=826.5s)]
*  D backs are banged up, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=829.0600000000001s)]
*  Waddle and Tyreek have had the flag next to them all week, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=831.62s)]
*  but they're playing. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=833.58s)]
*  And then there's this Jaguars redemption season, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=835.02s)]
*  eight and three last year, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=837.5s)]
*  and then just all shit broke loose [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=838.9s)]
*  and Lawrence had all these injuries. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=841.14s)]
*  And this just feels to me like a Jaguar. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=842.7s)]
*  I like the money line too, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=845.62s)]
*  but the plus three and a half is a gift. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=846.7s)]
*  I want to grab the points. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=848.54s)]
*  It's a full point inflated. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=849.82s)]
*  And I think that's a function of how the Jaguars [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=852.14s)]
*  ended their season on that one and five till. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=856.58s)]
*  Just the speaking of weaponry, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=860.46s)]
*  what the Dolphins bring to the table. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=862.46s)]
*  Here's the important thing on the observation you made [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=864.4200000000001s)]
*  about these early season Dolphins games [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=867.6600000000001s)]
*  and the advantage they have. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=870.0200000000001s)]
*  They're playing another Florida team. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=871.22s)]
*  Jacksonville's been practicing in it. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=873.6600000000001s)]
*  They're ready for it. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=876.0200000000001s)]
*  That corollary applies to just about every other team [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=878.34s)]
*  in the country, but not Jacksonville. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=881.1800000000001s)]
*  So I'm perfectly fine with this. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=883.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's like Jacksonville and Carolina, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=884.82s)]
*  maybe Miami would be the only teams that are like, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=885.94s)]
*  I'm used to this weather. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=888.5799999999999s)]
*  Does your team count? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=890.42s)]
*  Tampa, Tampa would be in there. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=891.9s)]
*  My team is close. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=893.4599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=894.8199999999999s)]
*  But we're even right now about eight or nine degrees [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=896.2199999999999s)]
*  behind Miami at the moment. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=899.02s)]
*  So it's gonna be hot and humid down there. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=901.66s)]
*  We've come to visit you many times in DC. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=904.3399999999999s)]
*  There was one time Jacko and I came [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=907.54s)]
*  and it was still the hottest I've ever been. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=909.38s)]
*  And I've been in Vegas and Arizona [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=911.66s)]
*  and all these different places. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=913.4599999999999s)]
*  We tried to walk around and go see the capital. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=914.66s)]
*  And we were like, honestly, I thought Jacko was gonna die. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=917.62s)]
*  In fact, I think he might've. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=920.82s)]
*  I think he died and was reincarnated. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=922.1s)]
*  90% humidity. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=924.38s)]
*  But Jags, I just like the Jags more than the Miami. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=926.0600000000001s)]
*  And if you're backing them for the season [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=929.38s)]
*  as a possible 10-win team, this again they have to win. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=931.5400000000001s)]
*  In Miami, they lose this one. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=933.98s)]
*  It was like, ah, we had some injuries. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=936.0200000000001s)]
*  It's all right, wake up call, here we go. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=937.74s)]
*  All right, so we're marking that one down. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=939.5s)]
*  Next one. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=941.14s)]
*  Cardinals are in Buffalo. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=943.86s)]
*  This line also seems a little too high. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=945.18s)]
*  It bounced around. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=947.06s)]
*  It got down to five and a half now. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=948.2199999999999s)]
*  It's back up to six and a half. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=949.7399999999999s)]
*  There's cheap touchdown potential, which I love. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=952.0999999999999s)]
*  Where they could be down 10, 11, 12. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=955.2199999999999s)]
*  They get like the last three minutes of the game touchdown. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=957.5s)]
*  I think their offense is gonna be moving the ball [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=960.4599999999999s)]
*  the whole game. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=962.78s)]
*  I like getting points, getting more than four points [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=963.62s)]
*  with a team that has a good offense. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=966.9799999999999s)]
*  And I'm not sure what to make of this Bills team yet. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=969.74s)]
*  And you know, this was a game that was [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=971.78s)]
*  this was probably my biggest regret of the over-under pod. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=974.98s)]
*  Taking Pittsburgh over Buffalo as my last playoff team. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=977.86s)]
*  But I was so scared off by the Bills defense. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=981.98s)]
*  And some of the uncertainty they have. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=986.1s)]
*  60 million in dead cap space. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=988.22s)]
*  And you know, them relying on rookie receivers [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=990.5s)]
*  and guys who were third receivers last year [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=993.5s)]
*  as like major third down weapons. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=995.46s)]
*  I like the cards to hang around in this game. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=999.18s)]
*  Where do you stand? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1001.5s)]
*  Yeah, I'm in the same boat as you. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1002.42s)]
*  And you know, here we are starting off another season [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1004.26s)]
*  with this Buffalo defense with Matt Milano on the shelf. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1007.86s)]
*  And you sit down just in, if you wanna put on some blinders [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1011.06s)]
*  and think about the impact of Milano on that defense. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1014.9399999999999s)]
*  The splits between when he's on the field and off the field. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1018.3399999999999s)]
*  You can get a very good perspective on it. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1021.42s)]
*  And so there's just a lot of question marks [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1024.78s)]
*  on the Buffalo defensive side. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1026.7s)]
*  Plus their whole secondary is different. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1028.6599999999999s)]
*  Right. Which brand new secondary. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1030.78s)]
*  Maybe it won't be that much worse, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1032.78s)]
*  but it's a complete reboot. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1033.62s)]
*  And from a pass rush standpoint, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1035.26s)]
*  or they're probably in the middle of the pack. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1038.5s)]
*  You did it, pass rush. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1040.26s)]
*  You just did it. Pass rush. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1041.3799999999999s)]
*  You did it. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1042.82s)]
*  Well, there's some good trend stuff out there too. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1044.5s)]
*  Kyler Murray getting six points or more, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1046.4199999999998s)]
*  11 and five against the spread. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1049.06s)]
*  Josh Allen, not great as a favorite. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1050.6599999999999s)]
*  Josh Allen, when favored by four points or more, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1054.02s)]
*  eight, 16 and one, 25 times. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1057.1799999999998s)]
*  Wow. Eight, 16 and one. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1059.54s)]
*  So we just love the backdoor cover action for this. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1060.9s)]
*  I mean, a nice backdoor week one. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1064.5800000000002s)]
*  That's a great way to start it. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1066.7800000000002s)]
*  I like the cards weapons. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1068.3000000000002s)]
*  They were popping up in all the fantasy drafts I did. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1069.5400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1072.18s)]
*  They must've had five guys had actual money spent on them. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1073.18s)]
*  Trey McBride was probably the number three tight end [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1076.66s)]
*  in any draft I was in. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1079.1000000000001s)]
*  So there's some good Arizona bets here. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1080.74s)]
*  And I want to talk this out with you. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1082.98s)]
*  We could just take the six and a half. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1084.1000000000001s)]
*  We could also get super ambitious, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1087.6200000000001s)]
*  take the money line plus two 15 [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1089.86s)]
*  and then add that Fandol thing to it. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1092.54s)]
*  So it would actually be plus four 30. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1094.3799999999999s)]
*  That's on the table. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1096.2199999999998s)]
*  There's an alt, a couple of alt bets we could do. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1097.5s)]
*  We could pull Arizona up to 11 and a half on Fandol, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1100.8999999999999s)]
*  go with the over, bring that down to 42 and a half. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1104.26s)]
*  And that's basically even money minus one of three. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1108.3799999999999s)]
*  We could take Arizona to plus eight and a half. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1110.8999999999999s)]
*  So basically have to be a two score win for Buffalo. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1113.3s)]
*  Bring the over to 39 and a half. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1116.58s)]
*  And that's even money. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1118.62s)]
*  So you could say Arizona plus eight and a half, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1120.6599999999999s)]
*  40 points and up we win. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1123.62s)]
*  Or just take the six and a half and call it a day. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1126.02s)]
*  My preference at this stage of the season, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1129.4199999999998s)]
*  I mean, there will be, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1132.02s)]
*  and this is kind of a recent development, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1134.3799999999999s)]
*  a bunch of unders. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1137.26s)]
*  Unders will be the prevailing story here. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1138.2199999999998s)]
*  We are now in this era of quarterbacks [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1141.9399999999998s)]
*  sitting out the entire preseason, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1145.26s)]
*  a whole bunch of teams had their quarter. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1147.02s)]
*  So you'll see across the board. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1148.7s)]
*  Now the counter to that is the new kickoff rule. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1150.3s)]
*  And what impact will that have? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1154.22s)]
*  Will it make scoring easier? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1156.66s)]
*  But see, I think it's gonna make the scoring go up. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1158.74s)]
*  Don't you? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1160.74s)]
*  It feels like the field position is gonna shift up. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1161.58s)]
*  That's why I like that over. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1163.66s)]
*  How do you do that? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1165.42s)]
*  Measure that against kind of some of the other factors [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1166.26s)]
*  about early in the season. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1169.5s)]
*  I think Arizona is gonna try and run the ball. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1171.06s)]
*  I think that's part of their strategy here. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1174.1s)]
*  So I'm inclined to stay away from the total [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1176.14s)]
*  and just grab the points [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1179.46s)]
*  because they know they can't defend. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1181.6200000000001s)]
*  They have the worst defense in the league, personnel-wise. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1184.26s)]
*  Gannon is not a big dummy. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1187.6200000000001s)]
*  I actually was so impressed with Gannon last year. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1189.14s)]
*  Me too. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1191.26s)]
*  The Eagles fans bad-mouthed him forever and ever, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1192.7800000000002s)]
*  and then he turned out to be a good coach. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1194.98s)]
*  All right, so we'll stand the plus six and a half. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1196.66s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1199.46s)]
*  There's one more bet that I thought was fun. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1200.6200000000001s)]
*  Arizona wins with the over of 49 and a half. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1202.62s)]
*  So it's basically Arizona wins 27-24, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1206.6599999999999s)]
*  and that's almost five to one on Fandl, plus four, 74. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1209.46s)]
*  So I like that one. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1212.74s)]
*  Had that one marked down. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1213.58s)]
*  Okay, two more. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1214.86s)]
*  Pittsburgh in Atlanta. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1219.3s)]
*  Pittsburgh, this has been two and a half, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1222.1s)]
*  then it got to three. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1224.1799999999998s)]
*  It was stated three for a while, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1225.3s)]
*  and now Pittsburgh is plus three and a half in Atlanta, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1226.6599999999999s)]
*  and I think there are five people that, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1231.78s)]
*  like Pittsburgh, had to get into week one just in general, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1233.98s)]
*  and I'm definitely one of them. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1236.7s)]
*  Craig Horlbeck, my rewatchables producer, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1240.22s)]
*  host of the Fantasy Football Show, even he's out. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1244.14s)]
*  He's like our offensive lines in shambles. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1246.6200000000001s)]
*  Anyway, make the case for Pittsburgh, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1250.42s)]
*  and we'll see if we agree on this. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1253.42s)]
*  Well, it's very simple. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1255.38s)]
*  The best head coach in the NFL over the last 20 years [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1258.3s)]
*  as an underdog is Mike Tomlin, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1262.34s)]
*  and we're going into a situation where [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1265.18s)]
*  there are question marks, yes, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1269.06s)]
*  on the Pittsburgh offensive side of the ball, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1270.82s)]
*  but there are question marks galore on both sides of Atlanta. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1273.34s)]
*  Under what scenario is the Atlanta offense [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1277.78s)]
*  with the weapons that you see on paper ready for prime time? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1281.74s)]
*  How would we know that Kirk Cousins [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1285.74s)]
*  is gonna be able to come out and be effective [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1287.5s)]
*  in any way, shape, or form? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1290.18s)]
*  They're going up against a top five defense. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1291.66s)]
*  Here's the thing about this game [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1293.66s)]
*  that to me just sets it up perfectly. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1295.98s)]
*  When I sit down and put side by side the units [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1299.3s)]
*  and compare the units, we're comparing units here, BS, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1302.94s)]
*  that the Pittsburgh defense is [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1306.82s)]
*  absolutely, positively, unequivocally [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1310.3s)]
*  so much superior to anything on the Atlanta side [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1313.14s)]
*  of the ball. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1318.3400000000001s)]
*  So you're giving me Tomlin as a dog, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1319.18s)]
*  you're giving me this Pittsburgh defense [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1320.3400000000001s)]
*  that is ready for battle, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1322.66s)]
*  and we're going up against a whole bunch of unknown. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1324.94s)]
*  I mean, Atlanta's gotten the benefit [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1327.66s)]
*  of a lot of popsicle sucking this off season. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1330.14s)]
*  The prohibitive favorite to win the NFC South. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1333.9s)]
*  Well, congratulations, it's time to play football. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1337.3400000000001s)]
*  The Pittsburgh Steelers are coming to town, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1339.8600000000001s)]
*  and Mike Tomlin has heard people bad mouthing [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1341.6200000000001s)]
*  the Steelers all summer long. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1343.94s)]
*  Let's play the football. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1346.3s)]
*  The funny thing is I told House before, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1349.34s)]
*  hey, we're New Guest Alliance, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1351.18s)]
*  let's make it seem like it's one of our phone calls. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1353.18s)]
*  Don't get too excited. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1355.34s)]
*  Pittsburgh's the nobody believes in us team. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1361.02s)]
*  That's clear. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1363.3s)]
*  Nobody believes in Pittsburgh. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1364.34s)]
*  People have shit on them for the last three weeks [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1365.7s)]
*  to the point that they were one of my favorite picks [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1367.74s)]
*  for them to make the playoffs, one of my favorite zags, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1369.86s)]
*  and even I had real doubt. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1372.3799999999999s)]
*  I was like, ah, maybe I should take a Buffalo. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1373.66s)]
*  There's an Arthur Smith revenge factor. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1376.9s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1379.14s)]
*  Pittsburgh offensive coordinator. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1379.98s)]
*  I'm guessing he knows Atlanta really well. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1380.98s)]
*  Couple of them. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1383.5s)]
*  We should mention Jalen Warren's hurt. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1385.22s)]
*  I think we'll be okay, we have Najee Harris. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1387.02s)]
*  You made the key point about Atlanta. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1391.98s)]
*  So Cousins hasn't played in a year, right? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1394.3s)]
*  Now you can say the same thing about Rodgers, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1398.3799999999999s)]
*  a guy that I really like, but Cousins actually got hurt, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1400.1s)]
*  what, five, six, seven weeks later in the season, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1402.9s)]
*  then Rodgers did. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1406.58s)]
*  Pitts is hurt, but supposedly playing. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1408.02s)]
*  Congrats. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1411.3799999999999s)]
*  I looked up the Atlanta, who are your receivers, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1413.5s)]
*  not named Drake London. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1416.1s)]
*  It's pretty rough. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1417.34s)]
*  Like they kind of need a giant Darnel Mooney here. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1418.9399999999998s)]
*  I've watched Darnel Mooney. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1421.4199999999998s)]
*  I'm not sure that's happening. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1422.4599999999998s)]
*  But you made the key point earlier. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1424.8999999999999s)]
*  I think Pittsburgh's defense is the best [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1427.1s)]
*  in either conference. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1428.8999999999999s)]
*  I think they have the number one defense. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1430.54s)]
*  And I think there's a really tough spot for Atlanta. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1432.58s)]
*  I think there's gonna be Pittsburgh fans there. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1434.8600000000001s)]
*  I think that Pittsburgh defense, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1437.5s)]
*  which has no injuries that I could find, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1438.82s)]
*  is gonna be fucking fired up. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1441.3s)]
*  And Cousins is a 500 quarterback. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1443.18s)]
*  That's who he's been his entire career, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1446.18s)]
*  is a 500 quarterback. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1448.94s)]
*  So I like this spot for the Steelers. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1450.3s)]
*  Get a lead, Russ, no turnovers. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1453.22s)]
*  Maybe two deep shots to Pickens downfield, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1456.8600000000001s)]
*  but other than that, just steer the car. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1459.26s)]
*  That's all. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1462.6599999999999s)]
*  That's all we're asking for. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1463.5s)]
*  It's like Kamala right now. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1464.9399999999998s)]
*  Just steer the car, Kamala. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1466.02s)]
*  Just, you don't have to give a five hour podcast interview. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1467.4599999999998s)]
*  Just steer the car. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1470.34s)]
*  Steelers plus three and a half. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1471.34s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1472.9799999999998s)]
*  I love it. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1474.3s)]
*  There's some alt stuff. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1475.1399999999999s)]
*  You could do pit money line with the under 47 and a half, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1479.34s)]
*  get over two to one. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1482.26s)]
*  You could do pit up to four and a half, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1483.34s)]
*  under 51 and a half even odds. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1485.9399999999998s)]
*  But I just like the plus three and a half. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1487.62s)]
*  Last one. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1490.78s)]
*  I like that money line and under combo. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1493.1s)]
*  I think that's a pretty good one. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1495.4199999999998s)]
*  Money line and under 47. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1496.4599999999998s)]
*  I think that's pretty enticing. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1498.78s)]
*  Well, speaking of quarterbacks coming back [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1502.7399999999998s)]
*  from McKilley's injuries, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1504.5s)]
*  the Jets in San Francisco Monday night, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1505.34s)]
*  that line has moved all over the place. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1507.9799999999998s)]
*  I think it was at six at one point. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1509.9399999999998s)]
*  It went down to four and a half. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1511.6599999999999s)]
*  It went down to four. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1513.1s)]
*  It went down to three and a half. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1514.4199999999998s)]
*  Three and a half, yeah. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1515.58s)]
*  Now it's bumped back up to four and a half [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1517.1399999999999s)]
*  because Iuk's back, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1518.8999999999999s)]
*  Trent Williams playing all of a sudden. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1519.98s)]
*  I'm just in on the Jets, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1522.94s)]
*  especially like it's a healthy Jets team. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1524.6200000000001s)]
*  And I think they can win the game outright. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1527.74s)]
*  I think it's gonna be a bloodbath. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1530.8600000000001s)]
*  And there's so many stats against the Niners this season. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1532.9s)]
*  The Super Bowl hangover. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1538.38s)]
*  The fact that they've had this window now [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1540.22s)]
*  that's now been a few years, right? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1542.42s)]
*  They had unbelievable health luck last year [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1544.7s)]
*  with their best offensive players. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1546.5s)]
*  McAfee's already limping around. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1548.1s)]
*  We don't know where we're getting from him yet. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1550.62s)]
*  Their rest schedule stuff is really bad. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1553.74s)]
*  Their division's gonna be better. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1555.94s)]
*  And it's one team that I think is kind of a dark horse, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1558.94s)]
*  maybe even a missed the playoffs, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1562.26s)]
*  but definitely maybe not win the division. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1563.74s)]
*  Everyone has in Pennsylvania versus a team [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1565.86s)]
*  that I think is gonna win their division. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1567.58s)]
*  And I like the Jets and I wish I didn't [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1569.3s)]
*  because it feels like a sucker bet. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1572.8999999999999s)]
*  Jets plus four and a half, what do you think? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1574.34s)]
*  So I'm scared of this game now. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1577.5400000000002s)]
*  I had a lot stronger feeling about it [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1581.14s)]
*  when it seemed like Trent Williams wasn't gonna play. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1583.3400000000001s)]
*  But now, I like the Jets very much. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1587.78s)]
*  On East Coast bias in our AFC East preview, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1591.98s)]
*  couldn't believe that I was advocating [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1595.78s)]
*  for them to win the AFC East, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1598.1000000000001s)]
*  but I believe that to be the right position. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1599.78s)]
*  I just against this San Francisco team [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1604.18s)]
*  that now feels like it might have a little bit [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1607.18s)]
*  of nobody believes in us. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1609.54s)]
*  No, everyone's picking them to win the division. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1611.14s)]
*  Well, the division. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1614.18s)]
*  They're like the third best odds in the NFL. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1615.02s)]
*  I don't think they qualify. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1617.3s)]
*  Okay, all right. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1618.78s)]
*  I think it was more of a we don't have IU, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1619.6200000000001s)]
*  we don't have Trent Williams, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1621.3s)]
*  but now it's like we have everybody, we're fine, here we go. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1622.38s)]
*  I just don't like. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1624.94s)]
*  That's what makes me nervous. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1625.78s)]
*  Like we kind of know who they are. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1628.98s)]
*  They're very good. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1631.5800000000002s)]
*  First round pick got shot right before the season started. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1632.6599999999999s)]
*  I didn't like that. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1635.4599999999998s)]
*  It's just like the stuff adds up where it's like, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1636.3s)]
*  ugh, I don't like the vibe. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1637.82s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1640.06s)]
*  That's just mojo stuff. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1640.8999999999999s)]
*  I want to see the Jets. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1641.7399999999998s)]
*  I want to see that Jets offense. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1643.7399999999998s)]
*  When's the last time we saw like three great Jets drives? [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1645.1799999999998s)]
*  That's what, let me see. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1648.7399999999998s)]
*  So that I'm in a stay away mode now, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1650.9399999999998s)]
*  like that number on four and a half, like prime Vegas zone. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1653.4599999999998s)]
*  I just don't want to get involved. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1657.02s)]
*  I like the case for the Jets. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1659.4599999999998s)]
*  I like the Jets defense a ton. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1660.86s)]
*  And I do think, I mean, we look like pretty, I don't know. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1663.3s)]
*  We're not going to overdo what we saw in the pre-season. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1666.58s)]
*  I didn't love it, but it's the pre-season. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1669.1399999999999s)]
*  So I do think Shanahan is going to have some great scheming [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1671.58s)]
*  for that Jets defense. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1676.54s)]
*  I do trust Shanahan much more than I trust Bobby Sala. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1678.5s)]
*  Big shot Bob. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1682.98s)]
*  Big shot Bob. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1684.26s)]
*  But I just want to, I'm going to stay away from this one. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1685.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1688.46s)]
*  Well, unfortunately you're on million dollar picks [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1689.3s)]
*  and we're not staying away. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1691.7s)]
*  I feel like that line should be three. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1693.18s)]
*  I feel like that line should be three [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1695.54s)]
*  and it's an extra point and a half and I'm taking it. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1697.14s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1699.38s)]
*  That's where I bet mentally when I do better [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1700.58s)]
*  versus where I don't do as well. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1705.06s)]
*  If I'm just looking at the line [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1707.5s)]
*  and it just seems off like that, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1708.9s)]
*  I really genuinely think it should be 49ers by three. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1710.54s)]
*  I think they're even teams. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1713.06s)]
*  No, I'm not going to argue it. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1715.18s)]
*  So we'll find out. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1716.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1717.22s)]
*  Last one that we like, the Lions three and a half [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1719.1000000000001s)]
*  over the Rams. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1723.06s)]
*  And what's beautiful about this Fandol, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1724.22s)]
*  double your winnings in any Moneyline bet special [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1726.38s)]
*  is we can bet on this Lions minus 198 [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1729.26s)]
*  and double what we win. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1732.3s)]
*  So the bet is the Moneyline is minus 198 [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1733.38s)]
*  if you win, you win $100 back. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1736.78s)]
*  We're doubling that. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1739.14s)]
*  So now we're basically making this an even money bet [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1740.1000000000001s)]
*  on the Lions. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1742.22s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1743.06s)]
*  As the Colonel James once said, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1744.7s)]
*  thank you, Eddie. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1746.42s)]
*  Thank you, Eddie. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1747.7s)]
*  Thank you, Eddie. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1748.7800000000002s)]
*  Colonel James lock of the week. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1749.6200000000001s)]
*  Thank you, Fandol. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1750.5800000000002s)]
*  We're doing the Colonel James lock of the week. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1751.5400000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1753.5800000000002s)]
*  Thank you, Eddie. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1754.42s)]
*  Thank you, Eddie, for helping us out. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1755.24s)]
*  We're going to take the Lions minus 198 [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1757.7s)]
*  that we don't have to deal with the hook. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1759.7800000000002s)]
*  I do want to follow this year that hook though, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1761.14s)]
*  that minus three and a half being afraid of that. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1763.2600000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1766.18s)]
*  Here's the pick where we argue about [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1767.0200000000002s)]
*  because there was one more game I liked [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1768.0200000000002s)]
*  and you were violently against it [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1769.3400000000001s)]
*  and we'll probably not do it. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1770.9s)]
*  But I love the Chargers minus three over the Raiders. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1772.9s)]
*  And you love the Raiders over the Chargers. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1776.66s)]
*  So what's the Raiders case out of curiosity? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1778.8200000000002s)]
*  Just their defensive line [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1781.42s)]
*  and the pressure that I expect them to be able to bring [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1783.7800000000002s)]
*  against a guy that hasn't played any preseason snaps [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1786.3600000000001s)]
*  because his foot was banged up [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1789.0200000000002s)]
*  and no noteworthy weapons on offense, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1790.9s)]
*  a bunch of no names. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1797.3400000000001s)]
*  I don't like the idea of Herbert [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1800.5400000000002s)]
*  limited in any way, shape or form [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1802.9s)]
*  with Max Crosby running free. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1805.02s)]
*  And he's going to be running free [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1808.02s)]
*  because they have Christian Wilkins now. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1809.7s)]
*  And that to me is a scary proposition. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1812.0800000000002s)]
*  If I thought the Chargers could try [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1815.1000000000001s)]
*  and establish the run, could run the ball, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1818.02s)]
*  then I would say, okay, let's try and make the case here. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1820.72s)]
*  But these guys are going to pin their ears back [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1823.9s)]
*  and they're going to go after Justin Herbert [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1826.3000000000002s)]
*  and his beautiful flowing locks. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1827.8600000000001s)]
*  And I'm worried. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1829.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm worried for the Chargers. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1830.5800000000002s)]
*  I'm worried for all the Jim Harbaugh enthusiasm. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1831.8s)]
*  This week one might be a dose of cold water. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1836.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm so excited that you called him Jim Harbaugh, not John. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1840.96s)]
*  Cause you've dropped about 10 Johns on East Coast. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1846.1599999999999s)]
*  Like the Jim John Harbaugh thing, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1849.12s)]
*  I think I'm bad with my pronunciations. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1851.2s)]
*  You're way worse than I am. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1853.52s)]
*  Well, I'm just going to call him Harbaugh [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1854.84s)]
*  and it doesn't matter. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1856.48s)]
*  Now if we could say, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1857.32s)]
*  it's Harbaugh will be right every time. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1858.9199999999998s)]
*  Which one's older? [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1860.56s)]
*  Is Jim older? [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1861.3999999999999s)]
*  Feel like Jim's older. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1863.12s)]
*  He looks older. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1864.04s)]
*  So just call him old Jim and young John. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1864.8799999999999s)]
*  Old Harbaugh and young Harbaugh. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1868.52s)]
*  Old, young, yeah. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1870.28s)]
*  I completely disagree. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1872.6s)]
*  I think the fact that the Raiders beat them 63 to 21 [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1875.56s)]
*  in mid December last year and got everybody's ass fired. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1880.32s)]
*  And I just think, I think older Jim [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1884.7s)]
*  is walking around the locker room. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1888.36s)]
*  He probably put the fucking box door up on the chalkboard [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1890.0s)]
*  and was like, hey, remember that? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1892.5600000000002s)]
*  Remember that one? [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1894.0800000000002s)]
*  So here's what we're going to do. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1895.22s)]
*  Because if we violently disagree, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1896.76s)]
*  that becomes a stay away. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1900.72s)]
*  But we're going to call it the argue pick. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1901.72s)]
*  We probably need a better name for the argue pick. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1903.0800000000002s)]
*  Just keep track of these. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1904.96s)]
*  So our first one is Chargers minus three. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1907.0600000000002s)]
*  This is going to be a separate bucket. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1908.8400000000001s)]
*  There's no money. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1910.24s)]

*  Some cheap touchdown, backdoor potential. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=1963.06s)]

*  This is to me a, I like one team way more [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=2005.26s)]
*  than the other team. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=2007.42s)]
*  Lions should be three. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=2008.3600000000001s)]
*  It's four and a half. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=2010.14s)]
*  I'll take the points. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=2010.96s)]
*  Okay, two more. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=2011.8000000000002s)]

*  and said, any Moneyline bet, if you win, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=2017.92s)]
*  you double the win on the bet. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=2022.76s)]
*  So we took the Lions minus 198 at home against the Rams. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=2025.26s)]
*  We don't have to worry about the points. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=2028.7s)]
*  Just go do your thing. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=2030.42s)]
*  You have all your games indoors this year. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=2031.78s)]

*  This is a team that almost beat you in the playoffs. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=2036.34s)]
*  Do your thing Detroit, right? [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=2039.7s)]

*  that you don't let me do the ad reads. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=2054.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=2056.3s)]
*  Well, maybe not a sponsor, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=2057.14s)]
*  but they definitely do the ads. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=2057.96s)]
*  I might have had to send a couple emails about that. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=2058.8s)]
*  Don't let Joe House do the ad reads. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=2060.02s)]
*  But look, this is the way I feel about that Detroit pick. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=2062.18s)]
*  Yeah, we love the Lions. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=2064.18s)]
*  Lions minus 198, you double your win. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=2065.9s)]
*  So if you bet 200,000 on this, which we are, we win. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=2068.16s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=2072.38s)]
*  We're in the positive on the actual win. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_wYRtYKac&t=2073.34s)]
