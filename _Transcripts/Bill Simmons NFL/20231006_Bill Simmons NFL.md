# Could Bill Belichick Leave the Pats for Another Team? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [October 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gs4wcKGkmoY)
*  Do you believe Bill Belichick will be the Patriots coach in January?
*  I do.
*  You do?
*  Do. I don't see it ending. I don't think he wants to end. I don't think he wants to finish it.
*  I don't think they fire him. And I think they give him one more
*  chance to get this thing right next year. I know that sounds so blasphemous,
*  especially with Christian Gonzalez going down and there being absolutely zero hope for Patriots fans.
*  You forgot about Matt Judon. Yeah, we lost two best defensive players last week.
*  I don't think he's obsessed with the Schuhler record.
*  I don't think it's I just I can't see after this sustained run of excellence
*  that Belichick can end on this season on this note.
*  And I don't think Robert Kraft, for as much as we know, you and I,
*  that he wants to win desperately and he is sick of not being in the playoffs.
*  And for every Hamptons event or every big Michael Rubin event he's at,
*  there's the old Patriots there around him and the the the surroundings of
*  championships and wins.
*  I can't see him kicking Bill Belichick to the curb on one year or one year's performance
*  and one year's notice. I feel like this would have to be a longer discussion.
*  And there has to be a graceful exit for Bill Belichick.
*  I can't see Belichick stepping away after this season.
*  And truly, I can't see Kraft firing him. Can you?
*  I'm going to do a semi-zag.
*  Who has a bleaker situation in the AFC than the Patriots right now?
*  Perhaps nobody.
*  I would say Denver.
*  Right. Denver is in a similar spot.
*  Their defense is the most abominable defense we've had in the last four decades.
*  They have this giant Wilson contract and they have a first round pick this year,
*  but not next year.
*  The Pats, who just if you go back, the last couple of drafts
*  that we all felt good about, they suddenly don't look as good.
*  This year's draft looks really good, but then you lose Gonzalez.
*  Offensively, you could talk me into just putting the entire offense on waivers.
*  Like, who are my keepers on that offense?
*  Like maybe even Colestrange with first round pick.
*  And you talk to anybody who knows anything about offensive line.
*  They're like, hey, he's OK.
*  They either their offensive players range from, hey, he's OK to.
*  And Ramon Dre, who was supposed to be the start of the offense.
*  What happened to him?
*  Here's why I think he could be done, because I do think he wants to shoot a record.
*  And let's say let's say this Chargers thing, you know, Staley just seems like
*  he's trying to get fired every week with at least one decision where he's just like,
*  watch this, I'm going to go for it on my own 30 again with a QB who has one hand.
*  They're two and two.
*  Yeah, they're two and two.
*  And it's ridiculous.
*  But if I'm Belichick and I want to break that record.
*  Am I breaking it in New England winning six games a year?
*  This is a real Zag.
*  You think he has somewhere else at 72 years old?
*  What if the Chargers now the Chargers are cheap?
*  That would be the one way this doesn't work.
*  But what if the Chargers were like, hey, we have Justin Herbert.
*  Want to ride into the sunset with us here in Los Angeles?
*  Wow. I'm trying to think of three or four years.
*  Dick Vermeals, the historical reference that's coming out, he ended with the Rams.
*  Fucking Lombardi went to Washington, Washington, of course.
*  At the end.
*  No, it's happened.
*  Dick Vermeal, Joe Gibbs came back, but he at least came back with Washington.
*  Yeah, I'm thinking Lombardi is the right one.
*  Vermeal.
*  There's last hurrah coaches.
*  But I'm wondering, like this roster, if you just compare it to everyone else in the AFC,
*  the one thing you need is a quarterback.
*  They clearly don't have one unless they tank this year and try to get a top five pick,
*  which is possible.
*  And they have all the ways to do it now that Gonzalez and Judon are out.
*  If they take and get a top five pick, this QB draft loaded.
*  Now you can talk yourself into maybe we could be good next year.
*  Does he want to?
*  I don't know if he's a tanker, though.
*  Yeah, I just don't.
*  He's never done it. I've never seen him do it.
*  Does he also want to be around to build up a rookie court?
*  Now it happens quicker now than it used to.
*  But it's you know, say they get the third or fourth pick and they get Drake, May or whoever.
*  They get Penex. Like, does he want to be with the rookie court again after Mac?
*  I don't know.
*  Interesting thing is like, what's the succession plan?
*  Because he's got two sons.
*  They have a succession plan.
*  It's Mayo. Mayo is the next coach.
*  That's happening. Lock it down.
*  Mayo, they kept them.
*  They prevented him from taking another job because they were like, you're the next guy.
*  If Belichick leaves or is retiring or is fired, which I don't think is going to happen.
*  Do you think Kraft gives Mayo the just OK, part of that staff?
*  You don't think he says, let's start all anew and let's go get a young, different.
*  I think he makes Mayo the head coach.
*  And I think everybody in New England expects that to happen at some point.
*  OK, he's a player, coach.
*  The way the most likely way I could see this coming out is the season there, you know,
*  with losing those two guys, their defense was going to be the calling guard.
*  They just lost the two best guys in the defense.
*  So is this a four and 13 team, a five and 12 team, a six and 11 team?
*  I don't know, but it's not going to be a playoff team.
*  And. Maybe Belichick, like, let's say the Chargers thing goes out.
*  Belichick can go somewhere else for three years.
*  Maybe he does it. I don't think he I don't think that Kraft would ever fire him.
*  But I think you have to either you have to go from Brady's last season in 2019
*  all the way through now, and you have to I love Belichick.
*  I hate talking about this.
*  I could not be more grateful to him for everything that happened in 20 years with this team.
*  But if you're Kraft and you're just looking at it and you're like, we had the best coach.
*  Can you say he's the best coach anymore?
*  If you start with 2019 with Brady, all the sloppiness,
*  all the weird shit that happened down the stretch that year, how that season ended,
*  the Cam Newton season, these three Mac Jones seasons,
*  they haven't looked like the Patriots for five years.
*  They haven't. And you could say it's talent.
*  You could say it's drafting.
*  But if he's like, I want to I want to pick the groceries myself.
*  Well, you haven't done a good job picking the groceries.
*  And I don't know, this is now half a decade going back to the Rams had Super Bowl game,
*  which was in the beginning of 2019.
*  So that's four and a half seasons ago where they haven't looked like the Patriots.
*  And I think Kraft, the Celtics are the team now in town.
*  Tatum's the guy in town.
*  Wick is like the the hot up and coming, like just kickass owner in town.
*  And I think Kraft gives a shit about all that stuff.
*  And I just don't think he wants to go five and twelve, six and eleven every year
*  with a coach that's getting old.
*  And it's interesting because you follow the same guys in the media.
*  I think the Greg Badaards and the Tom Kearns and the and the Mike Giardino.
*  Yeah, you got it, Cal and Reese and all those guys.
*  And it's like this year, they're openly just shitting on the team.
*  And like you've never seen that, like it's because there was a poorly coached this year.
*  That's an honest media assumption.
*  But like it's like the receivers before the season, I think Giardi went on
*  a podcast and was like, it's it's it's as bad as it's ever been before the season.
*  You know, like, well, wait a second.
*  I've heard a lot of good things about Taekwondo in.
*  And I've heard a lot of things about the rookie Pop Douglas.
*  And it's like, no, these are not starters.
*  And sure enough, those guys are right.
*  I'm trying to think of landing spots.
*  You say the L.A.
*  Chargers, like to me, Belichick needs to go to the right owner,
*  the right ownership group and the right city.
*  Now, Ron Rivera's team is playing.
*  So but Washington is the other one because new owners just like here, take it, go.
*  You know, like, let's let's start anew.
*  That's that's the thought.
*  So that's the Sean Payton path, right?
*  New owner and a shitload of money.
*  Belichick's under contract.
*  Could Kraft ironically get a first round pick for Belichick?
*  Yeah, I had a craft craft tight with Michael Rubin.
*  Michael Rubin's tight with Harris.
*  They used to own the Sixers together.
*  There's a whole sort of geometry that can be done here where there's familiar
*  bedfellows, but I'm not firing Ron Rivera yet.
*  That team might still win the make the playoffs or win the NFC.
*  That team's not going to win the NFC trigger.
*  I know they can make the playoffs.
*  Do you believe?
*  Yeah, don't.
*  I think this Belichick, I think there's a real chance this is it.
*  And I don't know how it'll play out.
*  But hey, was I don't know.
*  I don't think now.
*  Yeah, go ahead.
*  I'll say I didn't tell you.
*  Talked about it.
*  And it was like a funeral for it.
*  But was Sunday the low point?
*  Like in recent years, like just watching and you're like, it's listless.
*  They're not even the play calling is odd.
*  They're getting fake field fake extra pointed.
*  Like all this stuff like was that the low point on national TV with Romo to the or
*  also like all the whoever was calling it, I don't remember.
*  But like just a parade all over the paint was at the low point.
*  I think there's been like four or five low points and each one was lower since the tail end
*  of Brady because the tail end of Brady was bad and we all, you know, the Brady room was so amazing.
*  But, you know, going down to the losing on the lateral play in Miami,
*  getting Fitzpatrick coming in and blowing their chance to, you know, to get a bye week and then
*  just getting killed in the playoffs and then Buffalo, what they did to the Pats in the
*  playoffs, the whole Cam Newton experiment when he couldn't complete a pass more than
*  four yards to anyone.
*  But there's been a lot of ones.
*  I think Sunday was the worst because I still believed I was like, this defense is good
*  enough that we have the best coach of all time.
*  This is a must win game.
*  Dallas, we can run the ball down their throats like Arizona did.
*  Like we should win this game.
*  And the game was over in five minutes.
*  Max got worse every like four games.
*  He's worse.
*  And I don't know.
*  I talked to a bunch of people around the Pats and people that are connected and they're like,
*  he doesn't have the assistance anymore.
*  And they blame the assistance over Bill.
*  But Bill's in his early 70s, you know, like it's old to be an NFL head coach.
*  He's competing at somebody like McVeigh, who's 38, who, you know, burning it, you know,
*  obviously he's burning it on both ends and is just completely obsessed like Belichick
*  probably is as well.
*  But it's a difference to being able to do it at 72 and 36, you know, really hard.
*  You need to delegate.
*  Well, we'll see.
*  My bet would be no.
