# Reacting to J.J. Watt and the Six-Man CBS NFL Studio Show | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wuZyjwOWE)
*  The second best thing that we didn't talk about today behind the, uh, the
*  multi view CBS decided they would hire JJ watt for their studio show, which
*  already had five people.
*  So it's like, well, who are they going to get rid of it?
*  Oh, is that it for Phil Sims?
*  Maybe bill Cower.
*  This it's finally time or maybe boomer.
*  He's busy now.
*  No, they just kept JJ watt.
*  They moved them in.
*  They had this six man studio show, which is absurd.
*  So then it's a, well, at least in halftime, they're not going to do this.
*  Right?
*  Nope.
*  They do it at halftime.
*  They have six guys for the halftime show.
*  I timed itself.
*  How long do you think the halftime show was with them going through the
*  highlights, six guys, did the guests, uh, nine minutes, three minutes, 20 seconds.
*  The segment, they had six guys and they just went, they started on the far end
*  and then it first, they each read a highlight because it's always good to
*  listen to X football players read highlights.
*  And then they actually go for some analysis and they basically just started on the
*  far right and it just kind of went around.
*  Like it was clearly planned.
*  So there's no back and forth at all.
*  And it's just like, you go now you go.
*  Now you go, let's go to commercial.
*  It's like five guys is too many.
*  Now we're going to have six.
*  We're getting closer and closer to my Hollywood square stream of the, of the
*  nine guys in three stacks.
*  We're only three away now with things.
*  You know what I think it is?
*  And especially with CBS, because they skew older anyway, right?
*  CBS that's the old network.
*  The older shows old people have problems hoarding, right?
*  They can't get rid of, rid of old newspapers.
*  And so instead of getting rid of stuff, they just accumulate more.
*  And this time it's in the form of a studio.
*  Yeah.
*  Studio.
*  And they go to Phil Sims who, you know, it had a good broadcasted career once
*  upon a time, but you know, at halftime and he's like, you know, the Eagles,
*  that's a good team does that thing.
*  I was actually really interested to hear from JJ watt.
*  Like he just played against all these guys for the last 10 years.
*  He's the only guy, him and Burlson are the only guys on the show that have even
*  been in an NFL game, like probably in the last 20 years.
*  Just the, there's a whole thing in Hollywood that you get paid under five.
*  If you, if you deliver under five lines, you get paid a certain rate.
*  And if you go over five, you're considered a principal actor.
*  So maybe he's an under five, maybe because they have so many people, they have
*  to pay them as a under fives.
*  You get 10 seconds to speak.
*  I just don't know how networks are getting worse at this.
*  Yeah.
*  How are you getting worse?
*  Nobody wants a six person anything.
