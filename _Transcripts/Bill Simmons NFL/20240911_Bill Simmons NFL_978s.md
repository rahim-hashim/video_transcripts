# Did We Get Too Excited About the Jets? With Sean Fennessey | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU)
*  All right, on Sunday I texted Sean Fantasy and I said, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=0.0s)]
*  Win or lose on Monday night, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=2.4s)]
*  you have to come on and talk about the Jets. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=3.84s)]
*  Normally we just do rewatchables pods together [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=6.4s)]
*  and I feel like every time you come on this pod, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  you're either tortured or super excited about the Jets [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=12.0s)]
*  or the Knicks. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=15.36s)]
*  So now it's Tuesday [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=16.0s)]
*  and the Jets game couldn't have gone worse and I'm sorry. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=17.36s)]
*  Thanks for having me back. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=21.28s)]
*  I think last time I was here, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=22.32s)]
*  I was screaming about Joel Embiid [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  and today I'll be screaming about Robert Sala. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=26.16s)]
*  So thanks for having me. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=28.48s)]
*  Oh, let's go. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=30.08s)]
*  So Robert Sala, I looked this up. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=31.04s)]
*  He's now 18 and 34 career. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=32.96s)]
*  There's 201 coaches who have coached 50 plus games [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=35.76s)]
*  and he's 183rd in winning percentage now. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  He's in the bottom 20. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=41.92s)]
*  Cool. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=43.44s)]
*  All time. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=43.76s)]
*  And it's an amazing list, Sean, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  that like Hugh Jackson is on that list. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=47.28s)]
*  Nepo baby David Shula is on that list. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=50.08s)]
*  Joe Bugle, Mike Nolan, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  the guy who used to wear a suit on the sidelines for the Niners. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  He's on that list. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=58.32s)]
*  The one and only Romeo Crenel, he's on there as well. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=59.28s)]
*  And now Big Shot Bob Sala. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=62.4s)]
*  Are you out? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=64.48s)]
*  It's hard to say. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=66.88s)]
*  They just got their asses kicked by what may be the first or second best team in the NFL, right? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=67.84s)]
*  So like I can take a deep breath and recognize that they played a road game on Monday Night Football [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=71.76s)]
*  against an absolute juggernaut and maybe the best coach in the NFL. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=76.88s)]
*  But man, they looked not prepared [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=81.36s)]
*  and their defense got their asses handed to them. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=84.16s)]
*  He was completely out coached, made zero adjustments. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=86.88s)]
*  And obviously I've been waiting a long time to root for quarterback McAron Rogers. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=90.72s)]
*  And that was okay. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  That was pretty good, that experience. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=96.64s)]
*  But the defense, which is I think Troy Aikman used the phrase vaunted defense like nine times last night. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=98.32s)]
*  They looked mediocre at best. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, you said this because you were texting our Inner Circle chat [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=107.36s)]
*  and you were like, I don't understand this Jets love it all. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=112.24s)]
*  Our defensive line is going to be terrible. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=115.52s)]
*  Why don't people notice that we lost tough? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=117.6s)]
*  We added Redick who doesn't play. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  People are going to be able to run the ball. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  You basically laid out every single thing that happened in the game. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=126.32s)]
*  So, you know, it's a tricky situation because the whole defense is designed around [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=130.56s)]
*  not blitzing and having a strong pass rush and having lockdown secondary. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  So for the last two plus years of the Sala scheme, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  it's worked really well because they've had Bryce Huff, who was an undrafted free agent, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=144.4s)]
*  who they developed into an incredible pressure guy. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=148.08s)]
*  They've had John Franklin Myers, an incredible run stuffing defensive end. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=150.4s)]
*  And Quinton Williams has emerged as one of the best defensive tackles in the league. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=154.32s)]
*  They also had Quinton Jefferson last year who put a ton of pressure on the quarterback. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=158.0s)]
*  They lost Quinton Jefferson. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=160.96s)]
*  They lost John Franklin Myers because they couldn't, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=162.4s)]
*  because they traded for Hassan Reddick so they couldn't keep him on the cap. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=165.36s)]
*  And they lost Bryce Huff to the Eagles, who very smartly then traded Hassan Reddick, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=168.24s)]
*  who was asking for a lot of money to the Jets. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=171.6s)]
*  Reddick didn't play last night and they're otherwise down three of their six best defensive linemen. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  Of course, they got their asses handed to them by a running back that no one had ever heard of [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  until six hours ago. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=183.76s)]
*  Sala didn't make a single adjustment in the game and they were playing a bunch of [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=186.32s)]
*  nobodies on the defensive line too. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=189.36s)]
*  Undrafted free agents, like guys you've never heard of who couldn't keep up last night. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=191.12s)]
*  So it was, you know, for somebody who follows the team very closely, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  it was clear that the defense was going to take a step back. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=199.76s)]
*  The hope was that the offense would take a step up. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=202.08s)]
*  It just wasn't enough of a step up, I guess. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=205.28s)]
*  I mean, eight consecutive scoring drives. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=207.12s)]
*  That's that apparently that's a record for the San Francisco 49ers. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=208.72000000000003s)]
*  Have you ever seen anything like that? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=211.68s)]
*  It was horrible. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  I thought they were trying to start the game. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=215.84s)]
*  We're going to run the ball down San Francisco's throat and keep our defense off the field. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=218.08s)]
*  Seemed to be the plan, but they couldn't really run the ball. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=222.08s)]
*  But they had that one drive where, and we were texting about it was like, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=225.12s)]
*  oh, that's what we thought we were going to get with the jets. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=229.68s)]
*  Rogers making quick decisions at the line. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  Wilson was open and it just seemed like the right mix. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=234.72s)]
*  And then it just went away and we never saw it again. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=237.52s)]
*  I thought, so Rogers looked better than Cousins. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=239.84s)]
*  Cousins was a statue in that Pittsburgh game. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=243.28s)]
*  He just couldn't move around. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=246.56s)]
*  Rogers could move around a little, but it wasn't the same mobility that he used to have. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  Now he's also 40 and he's coming off a big injury. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=253.28s)]
*  I thought there were moments when he just seemed like he wanted to get rid of the ball versus [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=256.72s)]
*  actually trying to zoom out and create time, which he used to be great at. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=260.64s)]
*  I think the one interception that he had is pretty uncharacteristic for him where he was [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=264.88s)]
*  trying to force it into Garrett Wilson. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=268.88s)]
*  You could see it was because he was a little jittery in the pocket. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=270.72s)]
*  He really didn't want to get hit, but his arm is still money. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=273.76s)]
*  He was making incredible throws. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=277.2s)]
*  That free play touchdown to Alan Lazard and also that throw on the sideline to Alan Lazard. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  Those are insane. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=284.24s)]
*  I've literally never rooted for a quarterback who could make a throw like that in my entire life. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=285.76s)]
*  Watching that stuff was really fun, but this is an offense that is coached by the Immortal Nat [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=289.76s)]
*  Hackett, the run-run pass king running on first down on nine of the 10 drives that they had in [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=294.64s)]
*  this game. What the fuck is he doing? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=300.88s)]
*  The run-run pass king, is that his nickname? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=302.64s)]
*  It is to me and all Jets fans this morning. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=306.0s)]
*  If that guy was calling the plays and it seemed like he was, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=308.08s)]
*  that was just a master class in playing into San Francisco's hands. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  They had a really stout run defense and Breece Hall, who's explosive, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  was just getting jammed at the line nonstop. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=318.0s)]
*  I think he averaged like 2.8 yards of carry. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  This is one of the most explosive players in the NFL. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=322.48s)]
*  So that was really disappointing to watch. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=325.04s)]
*  He spent a lot of money on the offensive line too. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=326.96000000000004s)]
*  It was interesting when they brought in the backup and they were talking about how he was 20 years [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=328.88s)]
*  old and I was thinking he was like three and a half years older than my son. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  That is true. Braylon Allen, he's a beast. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=336.56s)]
*  Yeah, talking shit to the grown men on the Niners. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=338.72s)]
*  I thought that was amazing. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=341.76s)]
*  Kevin Wilds pointed this out and I didn't think it was true and I looked it up and he was right. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=343.2s)]
*  Rogers hasn't thrown for 300 yards since week 13 of the 2021 season, which was December 19th, 2021. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=347.84s)]
*  Do you want to guess what the number one movie was that week? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=358.24s)]
*  I'm going to put all your interests together. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=360.4s)]
*  December 19th, 2021. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=363.03999999999996s)]
*  December 17th releases too. There were Wednesday, Friday releases that week. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  That's just late in COVID times. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=371.2s)]
*  It was right when they were like, hey, come back to the theaters. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=375.04s)]
*  And meanwhile, there was a new strain of COVID coming out. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=378.0s)]
*  Well, I'll give you three. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=381.28000000000003s)]
*  Spider-Man, No Way Home. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=384.16s)]
*  Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=385.68s)]
*  West Side Story and House of Gucci. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=388.88s)]
*  House of Gucci was the one that really hit home to me because it felt like that movie came out [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=394.88s)]
*  nine years ago. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=399.2s)]
*  I think that one was a November release. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=400.8s)]
*  I will say Spider-Man, No Way Home is the number one movie at the Fox office. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=402.40000000000003s)]
*  Back then. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=406.48s)]
*  Yeah. That weekend. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  But I'm just saying to put that in perspective, those were the three movies that came out during [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=408.48s)]
*  Rogers's last 300 yard game. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=412.40000000000003s)]
*  Was he an absolute kook by then? I guess he was, right? He was immunized and all that bullshit. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=414.72s)]
*  What's it like to root for somebody who could be described as an absolute kook? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=420.08000000000004s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=424.16s)]
*  You know, throughout the entirety of him not playing, it hasn't been pleasant, but when he [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=426.08000000000004s)]
*  was throwing the ball, I was into it, man. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=429.44s)]
*  I was like, whatever, ayahuasca, vaccines, I'm not thinking about that. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=431.68s)]
*  What I'm thinking about is darts down the sideline. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=436.96s)]
*  That was just thrilling. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=439.68s)]
*  You know, I'm not a huge fan of a lot of the stuff that he's done in the public eye, but [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=441.04s)]
*  for a 40 year old guy, even if he still hasn't thrown for 300 yards in over three years, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=446.96s)]
*  it's clear that he's not over, he's not done, he's not cooked. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=451.84s)]
*  I mean, the Niners are good and he was able to score on them a couple of times. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=455.68s)]
*  He made Alan Lazard look like an NFL player, which is something that Zach Wilson was never able to do. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=459.92s)]
*  So I'm not completely out on Aaron Rodgers. I don't know how you could be after that game. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=464.08s)]
*  I do think they also have kind of a cupcake schedule coming up. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=469.52s)]
*  So there's a world in which they're doing very well. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=472.08s)]
*  I still think this is a deeply flawed team though. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=475.12s)]
*  And I'll be honest, you know when I really started getting nervous? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=478.4s)]
*  Is when you started gassing them up like six weeks ago. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=481.28s)]
*  And I was like, oh no, why is Bill on that? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=483.84s)]
*  I think that was the right instinct. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=486.24s)]
*  Especially after watching Miami who got completely outplayed for almost that entire [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=488.72s)]
*  Jacksonville game and then would have been down 24 seven, ETN fumbles, and then the game just flips. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=493.52000000000004s)]
*  And then Buffalo is like barely holding on against Arizona. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=500.16s)]
*  You know, it just feels like whoever can get to 10 wins in the AFC makes it. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=503.68s)]
*  The Jets next three, they're at Tennessee. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=507.28000000000003s)]
*  Tennessee is terrible. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=508.96000000000004s)]
*  Home for the Pats and home for Denver. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=510.40000000000003s)]
*  And I feel like if you come out of that oh and three after that Pats game, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=513.6800000000001s)]
*  or one and three after the Denver game, there's some salad possibilities at that point. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=519.6s)]
*  I was wondering about that too. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=525.6800000000001s)]
*  If he could get, if he would be canned. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=526.96s)]
*  It's a tricky one because I think the Pats are going to be a little better than people think. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=528.88s)]
*  The Jets are also playing three games in 11 days. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=532.8000000000001s)]
*  That's not, I have no idea why the NFL just, they have a 40 year old quarterback and they [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=535.6s)]
*  scheduled them to play three games in 11 days. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=539.6s)]
*  They also have a lot of nationally televised games on the schedule this year. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=541.28s)]
*  And if they're not good again, that's going to seem very strange. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=545.92s)]
*  Yeah, that Pats game is at Thursday. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=549.4399999999999s)]
*  So they go at Tennessee and then home for Pats like four days later. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=551.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's really not ideal. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=555.12s)]
*  The, I don't know. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=557.28s)]
*  I mean, this is a, this is, if you, that looked like a nine eight win team last night. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=558.64s)]
*  You know, it just looked like a mediocre team. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=563.52s)]
*  And if they are a mediocre team, you know, my prediction was that they all get fired [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=565.36s)]
*  at the end of the season and Rogers retires. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=568.88s)]
*  Like is, does that seem right to you? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=571.04s)]
*  What do you think based on what you saw? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=573.5999999999999s)]
*  I'm not ready to go there yet. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=576.56s)]
*  He had that one throw to Lazar down the sidelines that made me realize. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=577.8399999999999s)]
*  Oh, there's nobody quite like this guy in the league, right? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=584.64s)]
*  Just a couple, he pulls a couple throws out that I don't think anybody else in the league [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=588.3199999999999s)]
*  can make and it still, it feels like he can still do that. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=592.0s)]
*  It feels like he can still go to the line and be like, they're doing this. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=595.28s)]
*  So we should do this. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=598.9599999999999s)]
*  I mean, this is what happens in week one and week two. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=599.92s)]
*  The Niners just might be, their defense might be just awesome this year. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=602.16s)]
*  And maybe we were not going to realize that for three more weeks. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=605.5999999999999s)]
*  I think the Pats game is a little dangerous and that that's the one I'm trying to figure [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=608.7199999999999s)]
*  out, especially the Pats are home for Seattle this week, trying to figure out how real that [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=612.3199999999999s)]
*  Bengals win was. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=617.04s)]
*  I read everything. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=618.0s)]
*  I watched the game again. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=619.5999999999999s)]
*  The defense looked like 2001 hats on the ball, everyone flying around defense and they had [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=621.76s)]
*  a pass rush, which I had no idea they were going to have a pass rush this year, especially [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=628.24s)]
*  with Giordano and Barmore out, but they do. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=633.6800000000001s)]
*  And then they were really able to run the ball on the right side, which I don't think [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=636.0s)]
*  Ramon Dre was, I think one of the best running backs in week one, if not the best one. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=639.28s)]
*  So the way they ran the ball against Cincy, I think they could do against the Jets. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=643.84s)]
*  I think they could pressure Rogers. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=649.6s)]
*  So it's, it's a little bit of a scarier game than maybe I was counting on. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=652.8s)]
*  I thought the Pats are going to be reprehensibly bad and they're not. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=656.32s)]
*  I thought that there was one crazy moment, like a real sliding doors moment in the Pats [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=660.08s)]
*  game where Burrow threw the touchdown, I think it was in the second quarter that got called [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=664.4000000000001s)]
*  back and then he threw another pass over the middle to the tight end that got punched out [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=667.84s)]
*  at like the six yard line and fumbled. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=671.44s)]
*  And I thought if they went in and scored there, the Bengals might have been rolling down a [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=674.32s)]
*  hill and that didn't happen. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=678.1600000000001s)]
*  But I was watching the Pats closely because I was like, I need the Pats to not be good [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=680.48s)]
*  for once in my life. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=683.6s)]
*  Yeah, I was like, oh fuck, they're good. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=684.96s)]
*  This is not, this is really not ideal. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=686.1600000000001s)]
*  And that was when I started texting you and I was like, okay, so the Dolphins look bad [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=687.84s)]
*  and they pulled the game out. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=690.88s)]
*  The Bills completely turned their act around in the second half and looked dominant in [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=692.0s)]
*  the second half of the game. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=695.28s)]
*  And the Pats are going to be tough and they played hard for Mayo. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=696.64s)]
*  And even though the Jets have ostensibly an easier schedule, man, every team picking [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=699.44s)]
*  them to go like 12 and five or 13 and four, that just doesn't feel right. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=704.32s)]
*  It doesn't taste right somehow based on what they've done. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=707.76s)]
*  Also, you know, Joe Douglas, who did pick Garrett Wilson, who did pick Sauce Gardner, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=710.24s)]
*  who did find Jermaine Johnson at the end of the first round of a draft, you know, he also [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=715.36s)]
*  picked Zach Wilson second overall. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=720.32s)]
*  He also waited too long to add a veteran quarterback to the team. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=722.0s)]
*  He also has now taken two consecutive first round picks that I don't think are going to [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=724.96s)]
*  contribute to this team really all that much this year. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=727.92s)]
*  And Will MacDonald last year and Oluf Ashenu on the offensive line this year. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=729.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, it's like you used to say about Belichick. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=734.72s)]
*  It's like you keep taking guys in the first and second round that don't contribute. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=736.48s)]
*  That's going to catch up with you. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=738.72s)]
*  Like those guys are not really playing that much. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=740.1600000000001s)]
*  So this is a team that doesn't have as much depth as you want. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=742.96s)]
*  The thing I didn't like out of all this stuff they did, because the Giants did a version [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=745.52s)]
*  of this too, where they paid draft compensation to get somebody who played the exact same [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=749.76s)]
*  position as the guy they just could have kept or just signed. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=755.2s)]
*  Like the Giants could have just signed a free agent instead. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=759.2s)]
*  They paid a pick to trade for Brian Burns and then Jets just could have kept Huff and [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=761.52s)]
*  maybe even just also kept Franklin Myers. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=766.48s)]
*  And instead they paid a draft pick to go get Reddick. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=769.2s)]
*  I don't understand the logic of that. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=771.84s)]
*  I would never want to give up a second round pick if I could have the second round pick [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=773.36s)]
*  plus Huff. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=778.0s)]
*  I think if you are a cynical Jets fan looking at the strategy, they felt like they built [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=779.44s)]
*  Huff out of nothing and they thought they could do it again with other guys. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=785.6800000000001s)]
*  And so they didn't want to overpay for a guy who doesn't play against the run, who's a [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=788.88s)]
*  positional switch player, who only basically blitzes the court, rushes the quarterback. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=793.84s)]
*  And so they were like, we can find another Huff, we can find another Huff. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=798.3199999999999s)]
*  And then they lost Huff and then they're like, shit, we got to get another edge player. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=800.9599999999999s)]
*  They kind of freaked out as a little bit late in the game. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=804.4799999999999s)]
*  Howie Roseman, you know, just treated Joe Douglas as a protoss. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=806.4s)]
*  That's another red flag. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=809.52s)]
*  If the Eagles want your guy, that's probably a red flag. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=810.0799999999999s)]
*  I totally agree. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=813.8399999999999s)]
*  Pretty good taste in players. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=814.64s)]
*  I totally agree. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=815.8399999999999s)]
*  And Roseman, you know, Joe Douglas used to work for Howie Roseman. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=816.8s)]
*  So that whole thing just smelled funny to me from the beginning. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=819.92s)]
*  And all my Eagles friends, of course, have been taunting me about it all summer. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=822.64s)]
*  So I feel shitty about that. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=825.28s)]
*  That being said, I don't know, given the schedule, given Rogers, given Hall and Wilson, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=827.68s)]
*  there are definitely going to be games where they're going to win 30 to 10. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=833.28s)]
*  And I have just not seen a lot of games like that in my life. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=835.68s)]
*  Actually, there was an amazing stat that I read, which is that they had games in which [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=838.2399999999999s)]
*  they scored three offensive touchdowns just twice last year. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=841.68s)]
*  And they actually scored three offensive touchdowns last night. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=845.1999999999999s)]
*  So it's going to be a better offense for sure. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=848.0s)]
*  Even Tyrod Taylor, he looked pretty slick last night in garbage time. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=850.88s)]
*  I enjoyed that. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=853.76s)]
*  I also enjoyed it. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=855.52s)]
*  I've always liked him. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=856.4s)]
*  I've always been rooting for him ever since he was almost murdered by the Chargers team doctor. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=857.36s)]
*  I'm also not out on this Jets season. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=863.6800000000001s)]
*  I think one of the things is they're built to have a lead. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=866.16s)]
*  They're one of those teams where it's like, once we have a lead, we can run the ball, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=868.4s)]
*  we can do play action. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=872.24s)]
*  And then on defense, we can just, you know, rush and blitz and do all the sass stuff. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=873.44s)]
*  So yesterday was the worst case scenario. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=878.16s)]
*  Also, once the Niners realized they could run the ball, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=881.04s)]
*  that's the most terrifying team in the league when it's like, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=883.76s)]
*  oh, you're letting us run for six yards of carry. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=886.0s)]
*  And now you have to start moving guys up to try to stop the run. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=888.16s)]
*  Great. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=891.6s)]
*  This is what we're good at. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=892.16s)]
*  So it might've just been a perfect storm. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=893.44s)]
*  We've seen week one over reactions. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=895.36s)]
*  I'm not out of them yet. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=897.28s)]
*  Wilson and Hall are amazing. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=898.24s)]
*  You have two awesome weapons. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=900.56s)]
*  One of my big takeaways from the game, and this is something we've talked about a lot [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=904.56s)]
*  over the last two years, there was no Jets pass rush whatsoever last night, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=907.12s)]
*  but Brock Purdy was kind of slinging it. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=911.84s)]
*  Yeah, he was. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=914.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=916.0s)]
*  They even dropped a couple of plays. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=916.48s)]
*  Well, you know, the famous stat of the Jets haven't made the playoffs since 2010. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=918.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=923.76s)]
*  So that's like winter 2010. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=924.16s)]
*  I realized we first met and exchanged emails in 2011. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=926.96s)]
*  And we've worked together since 2012. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=933.04s)]
*  Maybe I'm the problem. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=935.12s)]
*  Time to quit. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=936.32s)]
*  Should I put in my notice this morning? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=937.36s)]
*  Maybe we just should have a more distant relationship. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=939.2s)]
*  Larry David quit the Jets. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=942.48s)]
*  Did he though? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=944.48s)]
*  I think he kind of did. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=945.44s)]
*  But if they go 12 and five this year, is he back in? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=946.6400000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=952.0s)]
*  You know, like he's my dad's age and you're dad, like it's, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=953.12s)]
*  when you hit your mid seventies, you just start going, fuck it. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=957.2800000000001s)]
*  So he's claiming he quit, but I also think he watched a game yesterday. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=961.2s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=964.1600000000001s)]
*  We'll get a TBD. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=964.8000000000001s)]
*  Maybe he'll come on the pot. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qRytKpAkGU&t=965.6s)]
