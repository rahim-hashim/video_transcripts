# A ChiefsRavens Classic with Peter Schrager  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqJJwjFdSOE)
*  All right, we're taping this right after the Chiefs Ravens game.
*  Normally Peter Schrager is on good morning football in the mornings with a good night's
*  sleep or maybe no sleep and some coffee and a chance to react.
*  You're doing this podcast now.
*  We're going right after baby.
*  What a game.
*  Chiefs 27, Ravens 20.
*  It seemed like the Ravens not only covered the plus three, but we're going for two in
*  Week one is an incredible comeback, incredible revenge game, chance to win in Arrowhead or
*  whatever it's called now.
*  And then Kevin Durant, Brooklyn, Milwaukee style foot on the line.
*  Great throwback.
*  Game over.
*  Do we feel robbed of the opportunity of not getting that two point conversion or do you
*  feel like that's just an amazing finish?
*  We'll always remember as the toe game.
*  If Likely's toe is a centimeter smaller, that is a difference.
*  Or do you feel like what would have happened if they went for it and they just walk off
*  and they won it?
*  Like what a cool ending for Harbaugh.
*  I feel a little bit robbed right now.
*  We literally finished watching Bill two minutes ago on your couch.
*  Well, the Ravens had a chance to steal the game.
*  It felt like the Chiefs pretty much gave the game away over and over again, but then we're
*  still leading seven and then had multiple chances just to get one more first down.
*  Couldn't do it.
*  And it was a weirdly sloppy game.
*  A lot of penalties.
*  From the Chiefs, a lot of penalties.
*  They just threw another flag.
*  Ravens offensive line looks super shaky.
*  At first.
*  Right.
*  And then at the end, it was just Lamar going back, waiting, scrambling, creating plays,
*  doing all the stuff that we love when we talk about Lamar.
*  But it comes down to the Chiefs.
*  They look gassed.
*  Chris Jones was on his knees.
*  They have two timeouts left.
*  I don't understand why you don't call timeouts to give your dudes a three minute breather.
*  They're all sitting on the field basically during these stoppages.
*  You had the long stoppage when likely goes down with the injury late.
*  And you think you were saying just, you know, at some point call a timeout because they're
*  so exhausted.
*  They're obviously gassed.
*  All the big guys.
*  I disagreed.
*  I said to you while we were watching it, Baltimore's got no timeouts.
*  Lamar's out of a shotgun looking over the sideline.
*  They look like they were frenetic.
*  You give a timeout, you give Todd Monk and a chance to give Lamar a play.
*  But gosh, of all the plays we watched, and this is really fresh, the Marlon Humphrey
*  coverage on the second worthy touchdown, which was a complete mental lapse.
*  Yeah, not supposed to happen.
*  That's when he's looking off.
*  He thinks he's got help with the safety.
*  That's a freak play.
*  That is something you practice a million times.
*  There's some sort of circuits that cross.
*  That's a huge chunk play.
*  If they don't give that up, the Ravens are in control.
*  The Ravens do have a shot.
*  So big mistake there.
*  And then you think back and then they almost steal it anyway.
*  Almost one better win for the chiefs.
*  That's their worst loss for the Ravens.
*  Oh, I think that's a fine loss if you're the Ravens.
*  You come out of that thing, you're like, oh.
*  Your heads are held high.
*  Yes.
*  Because the chiefs came out humming and they're like, we have three new offensive linemen.
*  We have a brand new defensive coordinator and we hung with the world champions in their
*  building and could have stolen that at the end.
*  So a bunch of legacies from this game.
*  Oh, we're doing the legacy stuff already.
*  Yeah.
*  Four minutes in a week.
*  Let's go.
*  Let's go.
*  Legacy number one for me is the chiefs nailed their two draft picks.
*  Not only that, but they somehow retool.
*  I was on multiple Patriot fan threads where we're just like, we couldn't find guys for
*  Brady for 20 years and the chiefs and back to back years just get Rice.
*  They get Worthy this year, who was looked like Tyreek 2.0.
*  They also get a left tackle who they highlighted during the game that the Patriots could have
*  traded up this year and gotten.
*  But they retooled, reloaded.
*  They looked faster.
*  They had that stat where it was like they only had four 20 yard plus touchdowns last
*  year. They had two tonight.
*  And I guess my big takeaway from the game is is the chiefs were, you know, they won
*  two straight Super Bowls.
*  I didn't think they were very fun to watch last year, except for the Mahomes part.
*  It was like a grind.
*  It was like, just let's get it done.
*  The chiefs were fun tonight.
*  Weren't they? Like, I'm back in on like, holy shit, the chiefs are on.
*  I'm watching. I mean, I didn't feel that way last year.
*  No. And they grinded it out and they showed those stats throughout the embassy broadcast
*  that they were like, you know, a middling offense all last year and they couldn't really
*  get out of their funk.
*  And didn't seem they didn't have that swag.
*  They had it tonight.
*  They had it tonight.
*  Worthy's first play from first time he touches the ball is a reverse play.
*  Pretty cool call touchdown.
*  It's not just the past two years.
*  Like that twenty twenty two draft, no, twenty twenty two draft was.
*  Pacheco, McDuffie, Karloftis, Josh Williams, I think Creed Humphrey and I think Creed
*  Humphrey. And that's like seven.
*  Like that's a credit to the front office.
*  Brett Veach and those guys.
*  And then, like you said, you just give me a credit to the front office.
*  You know, six minutes in.
*  That was good. You're a midseason former.
*  Ready? I slept in a couple of days.
*  They find these guys.
*  But like you and I looked at each other.
*  It's the fourth quarter.
*  There's two minutes and 30 seconds left.
*  And they're handing the ball off to Carson Steele.
*  Second down. Yeah.
*  Chiefs need one more first down, basically.
*  First down, they get five.
*  And you and I. And Carson Steele's on this roster.
*  I know that person still can do it, but like, yes, they had the like there were moments
*  where like, OK, interesting.
*  Juju's getting the ball there.
*  Like there are still holes on this roster and Mark and Hollywood Brown will get back.
*  And we hold that thought, though.
*  You put Hollywood Brown out there today and that's probably thirty five plus points.
*  So Juju was covered the whole game.
*  Yeah. Juju's not getting, you know, not now.
*  He won't deep.
*  Offense looked good.
*  And early on, they were destroying that offensive line with that defensive pressure.
*  But.
*  I found the rings that was nuts.
*  The first half, the Baltimore ran 36 plays and I think the Chiefs had 20.
*  Yeah. And usually when that and the Chiefs got the ball to start the second half.
*  But usually when that happens, you see in the second half, the defense just gets gassed,
*  which happened anyway, but the Chiefs were able to convert a couple of times, get some scores.
*  That yeah, that that Bateman catch along the sideline.
*  And then you're like, OK, also in this 10 seconds.
*  Again, you're kind of rattled.
*  You got up at two forty five L.A.
*  time today. I made we thought that she's game was going to be thirty four ten at one point.
*  My prediction about 40 hours ago on live television.
*  It is now midnight Eastern.
*  I've got to be up in. Yeah.
*  Three or four hours.
*  But I will tell you, I come out of that thing and from a Ravens fan, I feel pretty damn good.
*  There was a lot of talk about their offensive line coach passed away.
*  Three different offensive linemen who are not like seasoned guys.
*  And they got likely looked amazing tonight.
*  So like you have the pieces and Lamar was awesome.
*  I was a little nervous when Lamar was running around and I know Tariq on those guys like he looks faster.
*  Like over 17 weeks, I don't need to see Lamar getting cracked by, you know, Connor like he was.
*  OK, so that's worrisome to me.
*  But he was great tonight. Lamar was fantastic.
*  That's legacy number two for this game for me.
*  Lamar ends up 16 carries for one twenty two, throws for twenty six for forty one for two seventy three.
*  Great game.
*  That we need some sort of version for we're unleashing this Lamar tonight because we really want this game.
*  Sixteen carries in a 17 week season.
*  I'm not good at math, but that's a lot of carries.
*  A lot of that's over two hundred and sixty.
*  Probably not sustainable.
*  Yes. But the point is, they're not going to be able to do that every week.
*  So I want to know when you're not unleashing your hey, we don't care if Lamar takes a ton of hits this game.
*  We're going to have him run around, do his thing.
*  What's Plan B for this team?
*  I guess it's Derek Henry, but they're lying.
*  I thought they're lying. The first three quarters, especially like look pretty iffy.
*  What they were doing was they were they weren't running the ball too well.
*  So they were getting a little dump off passes to Justice Hill.
*  Right. But the chiefs just didn't.
*  Chiefs that were adjusted for and then Derek Henry did have a whole big carries.
*  We did that third down or he converted or was it a fourth down?
*  I'm delirious, but it was fourth and short.
*  Yeah. And they went for it.
*  And he would stop behind the line and his powers through.
*  Yeah. The receiving options.
*  Say, by the way, that got the for that, that got the cons worth doing the head is 250 pounds of man like
*  4K. Let's look.
*  Zay Flowers played well.
*  Isaiah likely played well.
*  Derek Henry, right.
*  The ball just like they're often so good to me.
*  They can compete.
*  So you're thinking the Ravens were a little bit better than you were maybe expecting in your head.
*  Yes. I didn't I didn't think they were going to hang offensively with those guys.
*  And I thought they the chiefs defense struggled all night corralling Lamar.
*  Chris Jones was dominant early on.
*  And then it felt like every time he got behind the other way, I think they were lucky to be in that game because you go back.
*  The chiefs ended up with 27 points anyway.
*  But think like they had that one that swing plastered Perrine where he was ready to run for a touchdown.
*  Lamar missed them.
*  They had that crazy play at the end of the first half with Lamar just in the Ravens for no reason.
*  Picks it off. They get a field goal to stop it.
*  Yeah.
*  But we never got the right replay to explain why the pass was seven yards short and he doesn't do stuff like that.
*  So you had that play and then that last drive, you know, I missed a couple.
*  He missed a couple.
*  I'm saying my homes missed a couple.
*  And then, you know, it was just three downs.
*  You win the game.
*  Second down.
*  Carson steals the game.
*  I would almost rather use the timeout than have Carson steal.
*  Let's come up with our best play.
*  Let's run the tie replay with worthy.
*  Let's do something.
*  But for some reason, they were happy to give the Ravens the ball back through the passing.
*  I deflected by Simpson.
*  Great play.
*  Then my home's catches it, which saves about whatever.
*  So it makes the Ravens use the last time out or I forget what happened and save them time.
*  Arisa has a great punt.
*  He does.
*  Yeah.
*  And I'm like, all right, I'm the 10 on the 10 with the mid like, and Lamar took him and he went and he missed as a flowers.
*  And he missed likely in the back of the end zone.
*  So to me, those are two passes Lamar will usually make.
*  Well, the thing with Lamar, we said this after the third quarter because it was two hours of them telling us how amazing Lamar was.
*  And he's faster and he's angry.
*  And he had this game circled.
*  And this is a different kind of Lamar.
*  And he's competitive.
*  Look at him in the sidelines.
*  And it was like, they have 10 points.
*  Let's settle down.
*  But then fourth quarter, you know, he almost ended up with 70 puts the fourth quarter, poured it on.
*  But I thought he was great tonight.
*  He also missed flowers wide open on that second to last play.
*  Had him had likely in the play before.
*  Wide open.
*  He does hit likely, but likely doesn't know keeping it.
*  I guess if you're a Ravens fan, you're excited that likely all the preseason hype, all the buzz, all the quotes about him, like, watch out for this guy.
*  And it was like, he looked like he was Tony Gonzalez.
*  Yeah.
*  Did you feel like we didn't get enough Derrick Henry?
*  If you're a Ravens fan, like this is all summer also, it's going to be thunder and lightning.
*  And they did a couple of cool plays where, you know, it was like a fake handoff to Henry and then it was Lamar outside.
*  But I don't leave that game thinking like, I know he scored the early touchdown and he had that big conversion, but I don't leave that game thinking that Derrick Henry is the focus of that offense by any means.
*  13 for 46.
*  So what is the walk me through the morning talk show?
*  Yeah.
*  Topics tomorrow.
*  So we do the, um, she did Lamar Lamar was great, but he didn't get it done again.
*  Did Lamar Lamar came into this thing two and four in the playoffs and one in three versus the,
*  Should we be worried Lamar can't win big games?
*  Did Lamar silence any doubts?
*  We'll do that one.
*  Oh, that's a good one.
*  Cause that's, that's like a little glass half full.
*  Did he silence any doubts?
*  Did Lamar silence any doubters for you last night?
*  Did he silence the doubters?
*  Yeah.
*  I'd say yes.
*  I thought Lamar showed up and was, was way better than we saw him in the playoffs.
*  Counter counter.
*  Not sustainable.
*  Okay.
*  He took too many hits.
*  It's a good take.
*  That's fucking crazy.
*  This is one of these shows.
*  This is an 18 week season and he took 10 flush hits in that game.
*  He played that game and they coached that game as if it was a winning end and it was everything.
*  And in a lot of ways, that was like a week 18, we need to play psychologically.
*  Like they probably felt that way.
*  Like we have to win this game.
*  Well, you saw the hardball going for the two.
*  So we're not going over time.
*  Fuck this.
*  That would be one topic.
*  Second one, we would go 30 times, 40 times showing the angles and the likely thing and
*  just kind of put that into historical context.
*  Is this like one of those games where we're always here?
*  Remember though, Isaiah likely.
*  Well, what are some of the recent ones like that?
*  Let's see.
*  There was that one Dallas, what was that Dallas Cowboys game everybody got all excited about?
*  Dallas Detroit last year.
*  Dallas Detroit was one.
*  The crazy with the offensive lineman declaring eligible.
*  Yeah.
*  At least this time the guy was out of it.
*  There was no, no question with the rules.
*  I would say the other topic would be the chiefs, their new weapons, obviously with, you
*  know, worthy coming out and what they did with a little bit with P Ryan, but Pacheco
*  tonight was fantastic.
*  Just grinding.
*  And my homes was amazing.
*  My homes was fantastic.
*  He had a couple mistakes that we talked about.
*  He missed P Ryan on that one and to the interception, but like I took the chiefs to win the
*  Superbowl.
*  It sounds boring.
*  I leave tonight thinking, yeah, she's going to Superbowl like that.
*  What that team right there at in that building, that is a tough team to be in the Bravens,
*  give them everything they can handle and they couldn't do it.
*  Worthy Rice and Hollywood Brown might be the three, the best, like top three receivers
*  that he's had from a explosive standpoint.
*  Yeah.
*  He had to make it hardman that one year.
*  And I guess the third was like Byron Pringle.
*  Right.
*  He never had like three guys that all had 40 yard touchdown.
*  I'll tell you a conversation I had with a source at Texas when they were all coming
*  out, cause it was him.
*  It's A.D.
*  Mitchell, it was this kid Whittington.
*  They're all in the NFL.
*  And I was like, you know, Worthy obviously he's going to be fast before the combine.
*  He's like, Worthy is going to be fast and everyone's going to look at his 40 time and
*  immediately compare him to, you know, John Ross or whoever, Darius Heyward Bay or whatever
*  it is.
*  He's like, but Worthy is a smart player too.
*  And it's one of the smartest players and like you can give him the ball on a jet sweep.
*  He knows where to go.
*  He also runs the full route tree.
*  So they, he goes 28th, the bills of the team that trades that I know it's early.
*  It's one game in, but like, did he not look like this guy was one of the most dynamic
*  players in the NFL ran out of the gates.
*  He looked like Tyree kill out there tonight.
*  It's so tough and same thing with the left tackle.
*  It was the best left tackle left and somehow just give up one sack.
*  People just love giving the chief stuff.
*  So they only ran 48 plays.
*  Baltimore ran 73 plays that game and lost.
*  So if you're, if you're Baltimore, here's take number three.
*  Okay.
*  They're at Dallas next week.
*  Home for the bills on a Sunday night.
*  Not easy at Cincy.
*  Not easy.
*  Is your sphincter starting to take the Ravens?
*  That's why they went with Lamar going.
*  18 carries.
*  We had to win this game.
*  What a great different angle it is.
*  If I beat the Cowboys.
*  Well, and then on the flip side, if you're the Bengals, you have the paths this week.
*  Right.
*  That's a win.
*  You have, you already go into Bengal schedule.
*  I love this.
*  Chiefs the following week.
*  That's a fun one.
*  That's a tough one.
*  Then you go Washington.
*  Then you're at Carolina.
*  You can be three in one.
*  You might have like a two game lead on the Ravens heading into the home game week five.
*  One game into 256 games.
*  I love this.
*  Or my Steelers.
*  Your Steelers.
*  Going in, maybe they win in Atlanta this week.
*  Who knows the Browns have the Cowboys, but you know, I never.
*  So you come out of this thing saying tough loss for the Ravens.
*  Well, you start out on one.
*  Now I need to go.
*  Now if I'm getting to 11 wins, I got to rip off 11 and five now.
*  I just did that math in my head.
*  That's why I make the big bucks.
*  That's why I'm right here.
*  I just, the own one start is just brutal.
*  I don't like it.
*  It's tough.
*  And I sort of like that.
*  My, my best player had a really good game and we lost.
*  She's did lose the first week last season.
*  They figured it out.
*  A lot of teams lose that.
*  Yeah, I get it.
*  I know.
*  What do you think of that French open match that we were, or the US open match?
*  The Buffalo Bills daughter won the semi-final.
*  What was her name?
*  Mochua?
*  Muchova.
*  She was, she collapsed.
*  Strow in a racket.
*  Yeah, it was a total collapse.
*  All right.
*  Any last legacies for this game?
*  Just a fun, awesome way to start the season.
*  The NFL can't script this any better.
*  And like, we have a game tomorrow night too.
*  It's crazy.
*  This is like a cool way to start the year.
*  I had a, the new kickoff rule.
*  Wasn't as dynamic as we had hoped.
*  It felt like it was still violent.
*  It was like, I thought we were trying to not have collisions.
*  These guys were like crushing each other.
*  What I heard on this new, maybe I've made one game in.
*  But everyone I spoke to was like, just wait till week one.
*  No teams are showing anything in preseason.
*  There's going to be crazy reverses and laterals and all sorts of wild bells and
*  whistles that they're practicing on.
*  We didn't see any of that tonight.
*  We did not.
*  The, uh, the only other thing I have was, was the coach interviews.
*  Can you explain the coach interview thing?
*  We now have to have a disgruntled coach at the end of the first half who wants no
*  part of talking to a TV person doing that interview.
*  And you've had to do those from time to time.
*  What's worse?
*  Well, the, they used to be off camera.
*  And then a couple of years ago, we started tinkering with it.
*  The rules now are that every team has to offer up at least a head coach.
*  Not at least one of the other head coach, offensive corner, defense
*  quarter, or special teams coach that has to speak on air.
*  So those are the two head coaches.
*  Melissa Stark got the two big guys, which is great.
*  We're going to be talking to special teams coaches on the, on the broadcast.
*  We're going to get offensive coordinators.
*  You don't do a lot of media or in the defense.
*  So we're going to see if we get anything out of these, but, uh, I've
*  only done one of them on air ever.
*  And it was a viral moment.
*  I had Mike McDaniel up in Buffalo and he was absolutely fantastic.
*  His first year as a coach.
*  And he was like grilling me about what I was wearing and he was fun and he was awesome.
*  That was not Andy Reed tonight.
*  That was not John Harbaugh.
*  No, they're like, yeah, we got it.
*  You know, we got to, we got to button down those turnovers and, uh, and just
*  like playing, we're doing, and that's, and if you're Melissa Stark, what else can you do?
*  You know, it's not her fault.
*  It's just these coaches aren't going to give you that there.
*  So I think the hope was to get some access, but yeah, I don't think we, uh,
*  no viral moments tonight.
*  You almost want to zag and be like, Andy, uh, have you seen Taylor Swift?
*  Just do something.
*  John, how about this weather?
*  John, your brother's back.
*  What's Jim going to do?
*  Like, yeah, something.
*  How many times you've talked to your brother this week?
*  Yeah, just he's coaching the team too.
*  Excuse me.
*  Yeah.
*  How do you feel about the U S open?
*  Any thoughts about Tiafa?
*  Are you checking Machova Fagula?
*  Yeah.
*  We were in, we were locked into that.
*  Well, great game.
*  Great chief's cover favorites.
*  Now want to know.
