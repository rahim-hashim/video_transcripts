# Who Will Be the Next Head Coach for the Cowboys?  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0)
*  So your team fired or didn't fire. What was the word? What did they do to make McCarthy broke up? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=0.0s)]
*  Um, yeah, they uh, you know, there's just not gonna be negotiations. They parted ways. Yeah, I'm in the middle [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=5.64s)]
*  I know you tried to get me to hate McCarthy, but I think the very few wanted him to come back [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=12.68s)]
*  Very many wanted him to be gone. I was somewhere in the middle. I appreciated that. He won 12 games three years in a row [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=17.44s)]
*  That's pretty great. I feel like it's like getting a new iPhone [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=22.88s)]
*  Like, you know, the the one you have is old and shitty and it's got like a crack in the front and you have to [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=26.759999999999998s)]
*  Charge it every three hours, but you're also a little worried about the new one, right? Yeah [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=31.54s)]
*  What if they have some bugs? I didn't realize [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=35.46s)]
*  My apps gonna transfer is my email gonna sync up? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=38.96s)]
*  I don't like what they did with the photo albums like photo albums the old way [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=42.0s)]
*  Yeah, and so if the photo album is gonna feature freaking Deon Sanders, I gotta be honest [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=45.72s)]
*  I might be out. I may have to tap out on this team for a little oh stop a little bit [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=51.7s)]
*  I don't like fantasy fantasy. I like it. Fantasy is always these [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=56.36s)]
*  Fantasies threatening to quit the Jets now. He quit the next Knicks couple years ago [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=60.92s)]
*  It's I need a break from the clown show. Give me Ben Johnson, Aaron Glenn Tomlin Zimmer Flores [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=65.26s)]
*  I don't care any of them Deon comes in and that first of all, he sucks [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  He really does if you watch I've watched college his clock management [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=74.26s)]
*  Scheming as bad as anybody else's right and he was 13 and 11 as a coach for Colorado [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=78.54s)]
*  I'm not even account Jackson deaf and state you and I could go six and six coaching with good assistance [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=84.36s)]
*  13 and 11 we're gonna sign this guy and pay him eight million dollars. I'm gonna go six and six [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=89.64s)]
*  Yeah, great. Oh, congratulations. A lot of bad experience a lot of video game experience [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=94.53999999999999s)]
*  I so listen, I don't have a dog in this race other than I love talking Cowboys with you, especially in this podcast [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=99.26s)]
*  I don't understand what he was doing the last 12 months Jared Jones [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=105.74s)]
*  Where they brought McCarthy back after it just seemed like after the playoffs he was out [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=110.5s)]
*  It was so it's such a humiliating loss or they know bring it. Let's bring him back. They bring him back [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=115.58s)]
*  They do all the weird contract stuff [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=119.82s)]
*  There's multiple points in the first half of the season where it seems like they're just gonna fire him. They don't they [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=122.25999999999999s)]
*  String it along even this season's over. They've lost that they string along the whole year [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=128.66s)]
*  They lose out on multiple guys who might have been interesting hires, right? And then they part ways with them [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=133.26s)]
*  I don't get it. It's just it's like did he just not want to spend one more penny on a coach? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=139.62s)]
*  He doesn't he doesn't buy guys like is Jared Jones cheap. He doesn't pay out with the coaches [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=145.57999999999998s)]
*  He doesn't he doesn't pay out first of all in the real world [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=151.38s)]
*  You'd be everybody would be fine with this like people should be able to play out their contract and that's it [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=153.66s)]
*  You have to give everybody an extension [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=158.85999999999999s)]
*  Like he missed out Belichick and Brayboy were the two best guys and he missed out on both of them [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=160.9s)]
*  Everybody's saying Belichick might have that and listen, he might not have taken that job [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=165.5s)]
*  Maybe he'll even turn that job down even though he has it in North Carolina [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=168.94s)]
*  But the book but you know, I feel like no matter what whenever they announce the head coach my reaction [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=172.84s)]
*  I would bet this is gonna be minus 2,000 that my reactions gonna be [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=178.98s)]
*  That that's that's gonna be it no matter who they name unless it's D. I'm it's gonna be a lot more [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=183.88s)]
*  Vitriol than that but it's gonna be it's gonna be a Ron Rivera type, isn't it? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=188.92s)]
*  Well, worst case scenario is Jason Garrett. That is terrible [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=193.28s)]
*  That would be the funny like funniest outcome is Jason Garrett or Billy Bob Thornton and land man would be the two funny [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=197.4s)]
*  funniest outcomes [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=204.32s)]
*  Deon I think would just be a disaster [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=206.54s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's our it's already dicey enough to just grab a guy from college and make him an NFL head coach [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=208.82s)]
*  Not having been in the league at all against anybody but to especially do it with somebody who's a pretty green college head coach [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=214.57999999999998s)]
*  If you said I asked I don't really believe that story [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=221.62s)]
*  I you know, I don't think it's hard to research like who broke the story do they have time something? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=225.22s)]
*  Are they maybe represented by the same marketing firm as the person who might you know? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=231.17999999999998s)]
*  There's there's some red flags in general. I don't it seems like it's good for both sides to pretend [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=235.89999999999998s)]
*  They might hire Deon. I don't think they're gonna hire Deon and if this blows up in my face, so be it. I [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=241.89999999999998s)]
*  Pray you're right because it's it's like I said, I don't is the shit show or a clown show. Let's maybe make a poll [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=247.56s)]
*  Let's put it out there. What's crazier to you Belichick? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=253.22s)]
*  Turning his back on UNC [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=257.8s)]
*  After already going down the road bringing people in doing recruiting and then being like, oh shit [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=260.88s)]
*  The cowboy job is noble. Good luck everybody [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=265.64s)]
*  Thanks for everything, North Carolina. Is that crazy or is it crazier just to hire Deon Sanders? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=269.15999999999997s)]
*  Well coming from who like Belichick, I don't think that's a crazy move from him [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=275.18s)]
*  I would expect anything from him at this point. I think it's gonna say he did do we have the Jets in the back that [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=278.9s)]
*  What was that? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=283.78s)]
*  2000 yeah wouldn't be good to do to Lombardi you would have to bring Lombardi back [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=284.65999999999997s)]
*  You'd have to put him on a podcast with van Latham or something. I don't know what you would have to do [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=288.58s)]
*  Yeah, Lombardi [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=292.65999999999997s)]
*  We're here for Lombardi if that happened [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=294.7s)]
*  but I [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=297.06s)]
*  Don't think anything's worse than the Deon thing. I'm sorry [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=298.74s)]
*  And then what would they have to get Shador to? What do they do? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=301.32s)]
*  They trade to the Titans. Does Dak go to the Titans and then more picks and then they get Shador? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=306.44s)]
*  This could be a complete disaster. Can I gently nudge back here? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=311.92s)]
*  Sure. For content [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=315.40000000000003s)]
*  The Cowboys hiring Deon is the fucking best [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=318.36s)]
*  That's like the best that would be the number one thing people talked about the entire offseason [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=322.44s)]
*  Deon and Dallas is this gonna work people like you would be like, here's why this isn't gonna work other people like no [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=327.26s)]
*  You're wrong this and we would just be off [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=333.53999999999996s)]
*  It would be if you're gonna have an eight and eight eight nine [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=335.78s)]
*  I guess eight nine now because we were something gives you're an eight nine team [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=339.14s)]
*  You may as well have Deon as your coach and not [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=341.9s)]
*  You know random coach X Ben Johnson do anything out of the content [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=344.62s)]
*  I'd be out of the content business. So it wouldn't be good for content. I mean for me it wouldn't I'd be out [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=349.9s)]
*  Ben Johnson does nothing for you. No, it's fine. That's good [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=355.08000000000004s)]
*  Someone like that could deserve it right? I think Aaron Glenn right Flores [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=358.88000000000005s)]
*  Well, I think is actually a really good coaching candidate, right? But it seems like he has there's some Jets [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=363.08000000000004s)]
*  Buzz with him now. I've heard that too and you know, Kellen Moore played their names [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=370.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, if you're the Jets like you want to get [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=376.20000000000005s)]
*  Somebody who's actually been a part of your franchise and is willing to reconsider going back to it versus what most normal people's [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=379.38s)]
*  Reactions would be to that of I never want to see you guys again. I can't believe I was on the Jets [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=386.94s)]
*  How about no coach? How about no coach like Jerry? There's no GM. Why not? No, try no coach. See what happens there [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=391.34000000000003s)]
*  Maybe Jerry just wants to act after his Emmy award winning performance of land man. He doesn't care. Maybe he's got the acting bug [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=398.54s)]
*  When I mentioned it to you, you were right you're right [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=405.15999999999997s)]
*  I have to hand it to Jerry when he does something good now was phenomenal the cry whatever the fake crying [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=408.15999999999997s)]
*  Really good act. Does it make like older like does a sir Anthony Hopkins look at that and be like you son of a bitch [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=414.88s)]
*  You're making it you're making a mockery of our business our crafts [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=421.64s)]
*  Well, it is like if Anthony Hopkins just like coach the Niners one year or one game and did that guy [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=426.08s)]
*  The really good quarter just popped in and called some plays and was like do this do this do this [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=431.97999999999996s)]
*  I'm trying to think of any other candidates. I think variable would have been great, but we took them [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=437.53999999999996s)]
*  Pete Carroll [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=443.73999999999995s)]
*  Talk about you've kind of moved sideways with McCarthy where you had this experienced veteran coach [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=445.34s)]
*  She's had success who won a Super Bowl in the past [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=451.24s)]
*  But is in his mid 70s [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=454.34s)]
*  I'm really okay with anyone but the Clapper or Deion Sanders [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=457.38s)]
*  That's it. So so you do not your DNH do not hire list. This is the Clapper. That's it. Dave Campo [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=461.32s)]
*  You wouldn't want Dave Campo back. I'm ready to be somewhat disappointed either way [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=467.88s)]
*  But it's got it starts with those two at the top not that he's being considered Jason Garrett [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=471.88s)]
*  I mean, did you have this actually is his name is [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=476.32s)]
*  It's actually it's actually up there if there are some you could look at odds some places. He's like third [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=479.71999999999997s)]
*  Really? Yeah, was Aikman in any of the odds or no? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=486.32s)]
*  I didn't see Aikman. No, he's happy being upset in the booth [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=490.21999999999997s)]
*  He's like a move on would you rather have Deion Sanders or Daniel Kellison as your head coach? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=494.09999999999997s)]
*  Daniel be fun [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=500.53999999999996s)]
*  Daniel and Jerry [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=504.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah girls [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=508.62s)]
*  Cheerleaders brought you guys and this nice they made brownies [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=510.7s)]
*  Lemon shots for everyone our friend Daniel our old executive producer [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=514.06s)]
*  Really we definitely bring the the 70s Cowboys back. Yes [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=518.0s)]
*  Man you say you're you're in the dumps with this down situation [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=528.12s)]
*  No, we just have to get off this day out thing and I think he made a statement today [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=531.88s)]
*  And so I think you're right. They might be playing each other against but he said Colorado is my home [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxVZPFbGr0&t=535.52s)]
