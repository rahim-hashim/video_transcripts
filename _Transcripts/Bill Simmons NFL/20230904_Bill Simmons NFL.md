# Can the Steelers Take the AFC North by Surprise? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yVXvU3G5d4)
*  All right, my favorite division, the AFC North.
*  So I looked up highest total wins
*  by a division in the last four years.
*  2019 NFC West 38, 2020 NFC North 38.
*  2021 NFC West 40.
*  Who had last year the most wins?
*  Who do you think?
*  It was 43, there was an extra game.
*  What was the division with the most wins last year?
*  Kyle, which division are we previewing right now?
*  Is it the AFC North?
*  No, it was the NFC East.
*  Oh no, I fell into your trap.
*  43 wins for the NFC East.
*  So I like everybody in the AFC North,
*  and I was like, well, they're not gonna have 40 wins combined.
*  And I went and looked it up and I was like,
*  well, the NFC East had 43.
*  Why can't we get there?
*  So the only team I'm going under with
*  is Cincinnati at 11 and a half.
*  Yeah, I'm with you there.
*  It's too high.
*  I don't like the Borough really no preseason at all.
*  I feel like something's hidden there a little bit.
*  Yeah, we don't know how injured he is.
*  And they're at Cleveland in week one,
*  a team that we both like.
*  I think they're gonna get there.
*  I have them either 10 and seven, 11 and six,
*  like right under the over-under.
*  I have them in the playoffs, but I do not have them.
*  I was kind of shocked by the 11.5 over, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Isn't that way too high?
*  Three quarterbacks should be very good in this division.
*  Right?
*  And so, you know, and then what are they doing
*  outside of that?
*  They have the AFC South and the NFC West,
*  which by the way, you read off the numbers for the NFC West.
*  How crazy is it that that's one of the worst,
*  it's top heavy with two good teams,
*  but I mean, that was like one of the best divisions
*  in sports.
*  And then maybe the two worst teams.
*  Yeah.
*  And now it's like, oh man, those top two
*  are gonna go four and oh against those bottom two.
*  So you get AFC South, NFC West,
*  that's six, maybe seven easy games.
*  Yeah.
*  And plus Minnesota, Buffalo and at Kansas City.
*  So those are tough, but again,
*  they've played first place schedules before too.
*  A weird team, the more you look into it,
*  like their offense was like 18th in big plays.
*  Like, I don't know, I envisioned Chase that down the sideline
*  and Higgins and all these guys,
*  but they were like efficient, but not necessarily explosive.
*  And I think they're gonna battle with some of these teams
*  and they're gonna get to 11 wins,
*  but I don't see it getting to 12.
*  Me neither.
*  There was a physicality to them
*  that as the season went along,
*  and I had them, I was higher on them.
*  I had a lot of futures with them last year
*  and they started out rocky enough that I was worried,
*  but you could kind of see it come along.
*  And the game when Hamlin went down,
*  that was a game where it looked like
*  they were making a statement against Buffalo
*  and then the game ends, which it should have.
*  Right.
*  It felt like, even the KC game, they were right there.
*  That game came down to a couple of plays,
*  but KC was better by a finger-dale, right?
*  It was like they were much better.
*  Everybody liked the Chiefs getting one, giving one.
*  That was what a fixed line that was.
*  But yeah, they lose baits, the safety.
*  They draft a defensive end from Clemson.
*  They're gonna be okay.
*  Defensively, they'll be okay.
*  Even though like Saks was their strength
*  their Super Bowl year,
*  I think they only had 30 last year,
*  so the identity is gonna be something to work on.
*  Great defensive coordinator.
*  Lots of good players on both sides.
*  I have them with 11, or 10 elite plus the coach,
*  I think is at least above average.
*  I think it's a tough question.
*  The secondary and a really tough division.
*  I'm gonna ask you this though.
*  Yeah, I think like Mixon has slowed down too, right?
*  I think he was like 29th in broken tackles
*  and stuff like that.
*  So he's gotta do a little more, Burrow,
*  which is interesting.
*  And obviously that offensive line has to hold up,
*  which we know is suspect from year to year for this team.
*  Every year in the first month, we have the,
*  uh-oh, what's wrong with that team, team?
*  Last year was the Rams.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know about the Bengals, but they're on the list.
*  Yeah.
*  But I don't think it's them, but I'm not positive
*  it's not them.
*  Well, let's try to remember not to go too crazy
*  because they were 0-2 last year
*  and they fought back to a really good record.
*  Baltimore is another slight under for me.
*  The over-under is 10 and a half,
*  which I just think is too high.
*  It's plus 104.
*  That changed.
*  To go over, which tells you that there's action on the under.
*  I just have questions.
*  I have questions on the defense.
*  Humphrey's already hurt.
*  I wasn't sold on the defense to begin with.
*  They're bringing all these different weapons in.
*  They're relying on Zay Flowers, who is, you know,
*  was young.
*  I always get nervous relying on young receivers.
*  Lamar's health, not sure about that.
*  Lamar just got this huge contract.
*  Never totally know with that what happens to somebody.
*  And really tough division.
*  They're loaded on the offensive line.
*  They still have Andrews, but this division,
*  I have them kind of fourth for talent.
*  Is that crazy?
*  I don't think so.
*  It's a very different team, right?
*  I think it was like a mass exodus defensively.
*  They lost JPP, Peters, Chuck Lowe.
*  Some of these guys are like a little older,
*  but they were good clubhouse guys.
*  So yeah, Kaleus Campbell, obviously, Justin Houston,
*  all of them.
*  And so that's one thing.
*  The other thing, and by the way,
*  did we talk too much about Lamar Jackson?
*  He got paid.
*  It was fine.
*  For months we were like,
*  are they gonna do right by us?
*  He got paid and he's up there with the best.
*  So now he has to play football.
*  And I don't know, this is another thing
*  where Harbar's a great regular season coach, right?
*  He'll usually get you the double digit wins,
*  but I like it slightly under
*  because I think the division has gotten better.
*  And my surprise to win the division,
*  I can't have four teams at nine wins in this division.
*  So I get it.
*  The thing when I said about how he got paid,
*  he got the contract,
*  that brings a whole different level of pressure.
*  A year ago it becomes,
*  they gotta take care of Lamar.
*  It's all positive.
*  Now he has two bad games.
*  He's like, my God, we're paying Lamar all this money.
*  What's happening?
*  And it's just different.
*  And we've seen, he definitely hears stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  He's definitely attuned to what people are saying
*  one way or the other.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  Yeah, I mean, he's in the bathroom, right?
*  He couldn't get out of the bathroom that way.
*  The one thing I wanna say is,
*  and a lot of the experts will laugh at this,
*  but how much has Justin Tucker worked to a win total?
*  Half a game?
*  You know, in my rankings, I had him as a two point guy.
*  And he was the only special teams person,
*  because it's like, he has to be worth two wins.
*  Yeah, so if they're an eight and eight team,
*  he gets them the ninth win,
*  or nine and seven win, he gets them the 10th win.
*  That's the only thing I worry about with them.
*  Their schedule's a little goofy,
*  where they're at Cincinnati week two,
*  at Cleveland, at Pittsburgh week four or five,
*  and then they go to London and play Tennessee in week six.
*  And they kinda have to get through those first six
*  being like three and three,
*  if they're gonna get double figures.
*  It gets a little easier after that.
*  Stroud and Richardson, two of the first three.
*  The defense is, I think, my biggest question mark
*  of anything in the AFC North.
*  All right, make your case for the Browns.
*  Over under nine and a half, plus 400 to win the division.
*  Do you have money on this?
*  I do.
*  I have too much. I don't know why.
*  I don't know if it's, you know,
*  because we know new people who work with the Browns,
*  and maybe this is my little dig,
*  but I have them at 11 wins.
*  I think, you know, Deshaun, I'm throwing it out.
*  Like most people are saying,
*  well, you know, we had a good sample out of Watson,
*  and he wasn't good.
*  I was like, no, I don't think he could be thrown back
*  in there like that and expect to pay dividends.
*  And, you know, Elijah Moore's added, good win.
*  Cedric Tillman, this rookie out of Tennessee.
*  You got Chubb focused, not splitting carries now,
*  with Kareem Hunt.
*  My guy Nick Chubb. No longer.
*  Yeah.
*  They pick up Thornhill, the safety from Kansas City.
*  Bookend Miles Garrett was a Darius Smith.
*  I think this defense is going to be amongst
*  the best in the division.
*  So I have them.
*  Stefanski's good enough.
*  And now they have Jim Schwartz, like I said.
*  Stefanski's good enough.
*  I think so.
*  What does that mean?
*  Well, he won his most important game.
*  He has two arms and two legs and a head,
*  and he could hold a quickboard?
*  Listen, he was at home resting with COVID
*  when his team won that playoff game.
*  That's what you want in a coach.
*  Just get out of the way.
*  Let them do what they can.
*  Their first five, four at home against
*  Cincy, Tennessee, Baltimore, San Fran,
*  and then at Pittsburgh, week two, Monday night.
*  And then they got at Indy week seven.
*  And I don't think Indy's going to be very good,
*  but they have some stinkers on their schedule.
*  At Indy, home Arizona.
*  They have an at Denver,
*  if you think Denver's not going to be that good.
*  At the Rams, Jacksonville at home,
*  Chicago at home, at Houston.
*  So there's some wins they can kind of grab
*  and then just try to split everything else.
*  I have them at least 10 and seven.
*  And you could talk me in 11 and six,
*  but I have them as a playoff team.
*  They're also kind of loaded.
*  And everyone's talking about their pass rush.
*  They have, I think, a top four offensive line.
*  Chubb, their receivers are better.
*  You said pass rush correctly.
*  You got to work on that.
*  Pass rush.
*  Yeah, I don't like when you say it right.
*  So the thing with them,
*  I think they're one of the high ceiling,
*  low floor teams, right?
*  Because if Watson's actually good,
*  I'm not even saying four years ago good,
*  but if he's just good and makes the plays
*  and does some stuff,
*  I think there's no question they're a playoff team.
*  If he's a C+, they might still be a playoff team.
*  If he's last year's Watson, then I would change my mind.
*  You say low ceiling,
*  and I know you said the NFC East had the most wins
*  last year, but if Fandl will make a prop about
*  which, I want to know how to say it.
*  Like total wins in NFC East versus AFC North?
*  Least likely to have a last place team with six wins.
*  Oh, I would say AFC North.
*  Yeah, this is a one, right?
*  Because NFC East is probably Washington.
*  By the way, I want to ask you,
*  when you did your win totals, did they add up to?
*  I didn't do that.
*  Then you're not a serious person.
*  I can't take you seriously.
*  I think that's psychotic.
*  Look at that, really?
*  That's psychotic?
*  You added everything up?
*  How do you know if your numbers add up?
*  I'm okay.
*  This year I'm a little under on my wins.
*  I'm probably like four or five wins,
*  but I'd rather do that than try to force some pick.
*  I don't believe it.
*  Maybe, you know.
*  All right, someone explain math to Simmons here.
*  It's got to add up.
*  It's got to be like 252 and 252.
*  If you want to take time to do that,
*  to make it right, I'll wait here.
*  It can be whatever I want it to be.
*  As you get them to add up.
*  Pittsburgh, over eight and a half.
*  I mentioned earlier the team that I've liked all year,
*  all off season.
*  This is my team.
*  This is the one you like?
*  I'm in on Pittsburgh.
*  I'm in.
*  I'm in on Pickett.
*  I thought their preseason, which you can kind of discount.
*  The only things we can really learn from a preseason are,
*  does the quarterback you were a little worried about,
*  did he look awesome?
*  Or in the Carolina case,
*  does this team look like an actual possible disaster?
*  Which is what they looked like.
*  Right.
*  Pickens, Jalen Warren is probably going to take
*  Najee Harris' job at some point.
*  They fixed the offensive line.
*  It's at least decent now.
*  They have Watt back for the whole year.
*  Seven and two they finished last year.
*  A lot of that was without Watt.
*  Tomlin never has had a losing season,
*  as you've heard that's that many times.
*  I like the talent and I don't think their schedule's that hard.
*  So, week one, they have San Francisco.
*  Yep.
*  And we're going to do Guess the Lines on Sunday's pod.
*  Oh, I didn't tell you, I have something else going on.
*  All right, I'm going to do Guess the Lines with somebody.
*  Raheem will fill in.
*  It'll be either plus three or plus two and a half
*  for that Pittsburgh game.
*  I think Pittsburgh's going to beat San Francisco
*  and could potentially become the overreaction team.
*  And I like San Francisco.
*  I just think Pittsburgh's going to show up for that game,
*  lay the smack down and we're off.
*  I believe in this day or so.
*  I thought about that just in general.
*  This is the podcast we could yell and scream about.
*  How many teams are there?
*  32 teams.
*  And probably about 2 p.m. Eastern time on the first Sunday,
*  we're going to be wrong about 12 of them.
*  Like, holy crap, four nines are down, 21 through.
*  The bills are amazing.
*  What was I thinking?
*  What happened?
*  Josh Allen's the best player of the week.
*  Let's enjoy this moment.
*  But you, I, again, this is a tough one,
*  but let me, like, Steelers fans are outraged
*  that it's eight and a half
*  when Tomlin never goes under eight and a half.
*  But let me just say this.
*  First of all, the end of the season,
*  the Steelers like kind of,
*  I don't know what they get lucky
*  and they play backup quarterbacks the end of the year
*  and they always end up getting to nine,
*  even though they have six in December, six wins.
*  They're not going to be able to do that this year.
*  They end with Cincinnati, at Seattle and at Baltimore.
*  That's as tough as it gets.
*  So they better have eight going into that stretch.
*  At Seattle's not that bad.
*  Oh no, it's going to be, at that time of year.
*  People, they go, Watt was out.
*  That's the be all end all.
*  They were the least injured team in 2022.
*  That's Mike Tomlin.
*  He knows how to keep his players fresh.
*  But now.
*  Did you see his sparring quote?
*  What did he say?
*  Before the preseason, or about the preseason?
*  No.
*  He said, you can't know how to box
*  if you don't do some sparring.
*  Really?
*  That's why he plays the starters
*  in the preseason a little bit.
*  Yeah, he's a man, Mike Tomlin.
*  I didn't know that.
*  He's a man's man.
*  That's not on my notes that he's a man.
*  Put that down.
*  Put that down with your 252, 252.
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  They faced Burrow, Lamar, and Watson.
*  Those are probably the best three quarterbacks
*  in the division the Steelers have faced, right?
*  A long time.
*  Well, we don't know about Watson.
*  I do.
*  I guess we'll see.
*  I shouldn't have said anything.
*  I'm all in.
*  I am in on a bunch of Steelers' bets.
*  The Division plus 470.
*  The Playoffs plus 128.
*  And I'll tell you this.
*  Number one seed, 20 to one.
*  Sprinklein' a little on that too.
*  What happened to you?
*  You were in the heat too much this summer.
*  12 plus wins plus 360.
*  Intriguing.
*  Not gonna do it.
*  This year 12 or it has to be over?
*  12 plus wins.
*  Over the course of two, three years.
*  They have to win 12 or more.
*  Wow.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, I think.
*  So the case for them to be the number one seed
*  is just the case that this division
*  will produce the number one seed.
*  And that it won't be Kansas City.
*  Because Kansas City, nobody seems to understand
*  who their receivers are other than Travis Kelcey.
*  Not to mention hard schedule.
*  Maybe Mahomes gets dinged for three games.
*  And then all of a sudden the Division's up for grabs.
*  We've had weird number one seeds.
*  I think this is gonna be one of the best teams
*  in the conference.
*  Tennessee was one couple years ago.
*  Yeah.
*  So the 20 to one is enticing.
*  So what do you have?
*  12 wins and you have?
*  I have them 11 and six.
*  And Cleveland also 11?
*  I have Cleveland 10 and seven.
*  And I have Cincinnati 10 and seven.
*  I have three 10 win teams in this division.
*  Your shit definitely doesn't add up.
*  I don't know.
*  What do you mean?
*  Last year we had Dallas and Philly in double figures.
*  We had the Giants at nine, seven and one.
*  So that's the prototype.
*  All right.
*  Okay.
*  I can do some that.
*  I don't know.
*  So you're out in the Steelers.
*  We're gonna know after week one.
*  There's some good ones.
*  There's a, first of all, a lot of it,
*  when you say like the ceiling and the upside is like the same,
*  like the Ravens, you can go nine wins exactly on Fandl
*  for plus 650.
*  I think that's like pretty good.
*  You'll be with, you'll be right there.
*  I think.
*  Right, you can hedge it in the last game.
*  You could bet, well, you won't like this,
*  but Bengals AFC championship game.
*  To make the AFC championship game is plus 250.
*  You'll probably look.
*  Those odds aren't good enough.
*  Picket five or more rushing touchdowns at plus 370.
*  Have you followed some of the Picket stuff?
*  Like he might have it.
*  You love this preseason stuff.
*  No, but he was good at the end of last year.
*  I was impressed by him.
*  He got concussed during the season too,
*  which people forgot.
*  He's one of the worst passing passers out.
*  What did he mean?
*  He had the league worst 12 passing touchdowns last year.
*  They had seven.
*  It kills me.
*  I know it does.
*  To praise Pittsburgh and be aligned with them
*  and those awful Steelers fans.
*  Don't think I want to be with those people.
*  All right, you don't have to.
*  But I have a lot of money in the Steelers.
*  I'm in on the Steelers.
*  I learned how to edit over the summer.
*  You can take that part out.
*  Thousand Poughkeepsies, mentally opening the bar already.
