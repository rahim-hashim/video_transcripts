# Five Favorite NFL Coaching Storylines with Kyle Brandt | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [August 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y)
*  All right. Our friend, Kyle Branton is here. We just did a rewatchable taping, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=0.0s)]
*  which is already up. We did Rudy. It went in a whole bunch of directions. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=3.84s)]
*  You called it the most polarizing sports movie of all time. Uh, you can listen to that. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=7.36s)]
*  But since you were here, I kept you on because I wanted to play five favorites with you. I've been doing [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=11.6s)]
*  leading up to this season, five favorite blank. I think this is going to be a really fun season. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=16.4s)]
*  I think we're all enthused about it, but I asked you, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=20.88s)]
*  give me your five favorites. Let's count them down from five to one. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=24.0s)]
*  And you decided to do coaches. Yeah. So why, why, what is it about the coaches this year? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=27.68s)]
*  Because there's some guys who are really famous and really accomplished that are in the pressure [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=33.36s)]
*  cooker this year. And it's, it's not the usual people. It's not any read. It's that type of thing. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=37.52s)]
*  It's like, there's a group of guys that are like the gun to the head. Like you gotta win a playoff [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=41.28s)]
*  game this year. Like no more of this messing around. And there's weird, weird circumstances. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=44.8s)]
*  So I have my five favorite head coaches this year. It's storyline based hot seat, pressure cooker, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  gun to the head, whatever you want to call it. You want to let me, you want to hear the list? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=54.56s)]
*  Yeah. So you, so it's basically five most fascinating head coach situations for 2024. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=57.28s)]
*  Okay. Go backwards. Start with five and we'll end with one. All right. Five. I'm going to go with [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=66.16s)]
*  the reigning coach of the year, Kevin Stefanski coach of the Cleveland Browns. And I'll tell you [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  why. This guy has won coach of the year twice. Last year, he and Joe Flacco went on this Disney [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=76.4s)]
*  movie run to the playoffs and it was a really cool story. There is a complete and utter enigma [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=82.8s)]
*  with Kevin Stefanski's quarterback, Deshaun Watson. He has not played a good solid season in four [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=88.72s)]
*  years. His last season that he played was good and healthy was the COVID year with no fans in [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=94.56s)]
*  the stands. And there was real discussion at the end of last season about the Browns have found [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=99.6s)]
*  something with Flacco. This works. They respond to him. His chemistry with Stefanski is amazing. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=104.8s)]
*  Flacco is now gone. I think he's on the Colts and it's like, all right, Deshaun Watson, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=109.28s)]
*  it's five years waiting for it. If we talk about the AFC North Bill, it's like, all right, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=113.36s)]
*  Lamar is the MVP. We're talking more about Russell Wilson and Justin Fields than Deshaun Watson. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=116.72s)]
*  And then Burrow is Burrow. So it's like the Browns need to win a playoff game this year. They should. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=121.84s)]
*  They were in one last year and got killed. He also showed up with a kind of a shitty attitude [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  to begin with. Yeah. Right. It's like for why? He's, he, they spent everything to get him. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=129.52s)]
*  He's hugely paid. He hasn't accomplished anything since some of these guys were even in the league. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=134.88s)]
*  And if like, if they mess up in that division, like you could look at six and 11 really, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=139.76s)]
*  really fast. So I think like everybody loves Stefanski totally respected by players, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=143.68s)]
*  obviously like voters and stuff, but he has to deal with this guy that not everybody respects [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=147.84s)]
*  and that is not only reviled, but just completely mysterious. I don't know if he has it. I don't [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=152.96s)]
*  know if like he was a top five guy in 2020. I don't know if he's a top 20 guy. No clue. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=157.12s)]
*  And like, I think we'll find out really quickly. They open also Bill the Browns week one game is [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=162.32s)]
*  Tom Brady's first call. Like he's going to be talking extensively about Watson. And if Watson [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=167.84s)]
*  doesn't play well, Brady's going to go in on it. It's amazing. The Stefanski is at the center of it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=172.8s)]
*  Yeah. They have that game. They're at Jags home giants at Vegas home Washington. So the first [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=177.04s)]
*  five, other than that Dallas game, which is at least home with some pressure on it, but the first [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=182.16s)]
*  five's pretty easy start. Like they're playing three of the worst teams in the league, but I'm [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  with you. I don't, I don't feel good about Watson. All the team overachieve last year, 11 and six, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=191.12s)]
*  they got killed in the playoffs. They're already having some offensive line issues. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=196.48s)]
*  They got chub coming back. God only knows what's going to happen with him. I don't know. And I'm [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=200.72s)]
*  with you. I have no idea if Deshaun Watson is still good at not only just throwing the ball, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=206.0s)]
*  moving an offense down the field, but can he lead an offense? Can he handle the day to day, the media [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  and people coming up and whatever off the field stuff, which she's had more than just about anybody. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=216.0s)]
*  And I see people, cause it seems like everybody's looking for a reason not to pick Baltimore this [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=221.44s)]
*  year. So a lot of people are gravitated in the Bengals. Some people are trying to talk to themselves [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=226.4s)]
*  in adjusting fields. And then there's this Cleveland side where they're like, Hey, that team's got some [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=231.28s)]
*  talent, man. Why not Cleveland? And my answer is cause Deshaun Watson is their quarterback. Like I [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=235.68s)]
*  don't, I just don't see it. They changed our offense to try to fit him this year, right? They [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  were big on the play action, deep ball, which he's bad at. Now it's like, well, we need a more [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=245.84s)]
*  Deshaun friendly. I don't see it. I just don't see it with that team at all. It's weird. The face of [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=250.4s)]
*  the team and the lead of every conversation about the Browns, it's just miles Garrett, miles Garrett. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=255.2s)]
*  I was like, it's great. Like he's an offensive player. Like who's the quarterback. We're not, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=259.44s)]
*  we're not doing anything with miles Garrett. It's almost, I don't know if they're loath to talk about [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=262.88s)]
*  him because of all the unsavory stuff he went through, or it's just, there's not much of a story [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=267.36s)]
*  there because he hasn't been that good, but week one, make no mistake. Like there's no hiding anymore. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=271.52s)]
*  You're going to be in big time prime time game. And if you suck, like you're going to get killed [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=276.0s)]
*  for it. Cause I think some people are looking to do that. You made the key point too. Four years is a [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=279.03999999999996s)]
*  long time 2020 to not be good. Yeah. They think about that. That's a presidential term. That's the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=284.0s)]
*  time between Olympics, you know? So it's like, no, no, he, it'll be good. And I'm not sold on their [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=290.4s)]
*  skill positions. Cooper, they got a really good year from last year, but he's a little older, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=296.72s)]
*  no idea what to expect from chub. And I just think last year was pretty fluky for a bunch of [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=300.96s)]
*  different reasons. They were really, their defense was awesome at home, not as good on the road. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=305.84s)]
*  Their schedule is going to be harder this year. Yeah. I'm with you. All right. I like that one. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=310.8s)]
*  Cause I think we both like Stefanski, but I love them. I do not envy the job is in their over-under [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=314.48s)]
*  in the eight and a half range, which feels I would, I would lean toward the end. I'm doing the under [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=320.32000000000005s)]
*  overs with Sal next week, but that's more of an under than over. They were a playoff team last year. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=326.96000000000004s)]
*  They got destroyed by the Texans, but like they made a run eight wins would be hugely disappointed [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=331.36s)]
*  for this team. But it also, if they win eight games, the Sean Watson got hurt or doesn't have [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=335.52000000000004s)]
*  it anymore. All right. Also the O-line stuff, if that's not perfect before the season starts, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=339.12s)]
*  and then you go into that Dallas game, Parsons is going nuts in the front. Like that could go [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=345.2s)]
*  ugly fast. All right. Number four. All right. Number four. Yeah. I have Jim Harbaugh and LA [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  chargers. This is, I think that Jim Harbaugh, he, I think he and Sean McVay are the two best living [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=355.84000000000003s)]
*  coaches right now. I think they're the best coaches in football. They're both in LA. And I [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=363.36s)]
*  have to tell you, Bill, on a personal note, I sat down with Jim Harbaugh like two weeks ago. I'd [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=367.2s)]
*  never met him before. I sat down for like an interview and you meet public figures, you meet [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=371.76s)]
*  movie stars, whatever you've done it. You, you kind of hope they show up as themselves. Like they hope [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=377.2s)]
*  they play the hits. My hall of fame for the three celebrities that I've met that show up and just [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=382.96s)]
*  like you want them to Guy Fieri, who is just like out of bounds, bomb.com. You're the best, man. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=388.0s)]
*  You're the best brother. Jack Black, unbelievably cool. Wants to talk about heavy metal and just [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=393.6s)]
*  totally chill. Love Jack Black and Jim Harbaugh, who walks to the interview. He's like, Hey man, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=398.88s)]
*  how you doing? Hey, what's going on? Hey Kyle, I met you before. And he's an enthusiasm unknown [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=404.0s)]
*  to mankind. Who's got it better than us? And I think he's going to do things this year. Herbert [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=407.6s)]
*  injury, I know it was like a huge deal and it kind of scratched the record for the chargers, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=414.16s)]
*  but here's my take on Harbaugh and why it's so interesting. Every stop that he's gone to as a [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=418.24s)]
*  coach, when he shows up, there is this big, bad video game boss. He goes to Stanford and Pete [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=423.76000000000005s)]
*  Carroll runs the world. He is everything with his USC teams. Jim Harbaugh's team immediately was good [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=430.24s)]
*  and they beat the shit out of Pete Carroll's team. Even talk shit to him after the game. Stage two, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=435.12s)]
*  he goes to San Francisco, Pete Carroll again, Seahawks run everything. The 49ers took over. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=439.44s)]
*  He was in the title game in year one, the title game goes to Michigan, Ohio States running [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=444.71999999999997s)]
*  everything immediately. Michigan's winning double digit games. They eventually destroyed Ohio state. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=449.84s)]
*  And now he shows up back in the pros with the biggest video game boss of all the chiefs who [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=454.47999999999996s)]
*  won two straight super bowls. And he's like, yeah, I know I got to beat my homes and read. No one can [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=460.24s)]
*  do it. And I got to figure out a way to take them out. I think it's fascinating. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=464.8s)]
*  I've been staring at them all summer. Talk about it. The over under is juice too high [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=468.96s)]
*  because everybody has seen that. Well, it's eight and a half. And you get, you mentioned the Herbert [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=474.4s)]
*  injury. They basically lost their receivers. They lost that quarter who wasn't, you know, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=478.71999999999997s)]
*  it wasn't exactly lighted up last year, but there's a skill position thing with them that I think [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=484.15999999999997s)]
*  really scares people, but they have a lot of talent, man. And they added, you know, a lottery [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=488.08s)]
*  pick left tackle. They still have a bunch of horses on defense. And then there's this Harbaugh [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=493.44s)]
*  thing. I texted a buddy of mine that, uh, that works in the, in the chargers world. And I was like, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=499.36s)]
*  just, is it, does it feel different? And he's like, it's like night and day, but you have no idea. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=507.76s)]
*  Like going from Staley last year to watching this guy walk in, he's like, I, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=513.6800000000001s)]
*  I thought it might happen this way, but who knows? And then you're in it every day. And it's like, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=519.12s)]
*  something shifted. And that, that seems to be the recurring theme with him over and over again. So [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=523.6s)]
*  I really want to talk myself into the, not only the over, but the possibility of them, if the chiefs, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=529.04s)]
*  you know, Kelsey, she Kelsey being old and maybe saving himself for December, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=535.36s)]
*  who knows what she rice is worthy going to be ready. You know, that, and that the chiefs were [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=540.4s)]
*  what 11 and six last year, it's not like they were lighting up. So for them to go one wind back and [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=545.84s)]
*  the chargers to somehow bump up to 11 and six, maybe they get to play the NFC south this year. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=550.16s)]
*  I think Denver and Vegas are going to be bad. So you go through, you can kind of find the 10 [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=557.6s)]
*  wins, but the Herbert thing I'm with you as a record screech. He's back out there this week [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=562.48s)]
*  as we're recording this and he's throwing it around and hard by even said, it seems like angels were [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=567.36s)]
*  singing when he came out to practice everyone in like we're programmed through fantasy football, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=571.04s)]
*  all of us. So we see well, Kenan Allen's gone and Eckler's gone. I totally get it. It won't matter. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=575.84s)]
*  He'll figure out a way they will score points. They will run the shit out of the ball. The second [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=581.12s)]
*  the chargers hired him, we were on good morning football and I said they'll win 11 games in the [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=585.2s)]
*  first year. It's what he does at every stop. There's never a warmup year. It doesn't, he doesn't do [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=588.96s)]
*  that warmup year. It's immediately good. And I feel like he's going to completely unlock Herbert. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=593.36s)]
*  If he's healthy, like I totally believe in hard, but I think they'll win 11 games in the first year. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=598.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm into it. And plus they say like, I lost Allen, I lost Mike Williams, I lost that quarter, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=602.8000000000001s)]
*  three guys, but Williams was out for most of the last year anyway. So really you lost Allen and [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=607.76s)]
*  Eckler, but your offensive line's way better. I didn't mind the Dobbins Edwards combo stealing [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=611.84s)]
*  that from Baltimore. They're just going to be like, we're pounding the ball. Everyone's why we're [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=617.12s)]
*  going to throw it. Jim's first hire when he became coach was the strength coach and he coached him. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=620.64s)]
*  And it's a guy who's a legendary dude. He's like, this is what I'm going to be about. I'm not going [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=626.08s)]
*  to hire the new coordinator defense court. Give me the strength coach first. Cause we're going to [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=629.9200000000001s)]
*  beat the shit out of people. It's just like we did at Michigan and it can work in the pros. He's done [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=633.9200000000001s)]
*  it at San Francisco too. It was Frank Gore and it was Kaepernick and it was like all the way to [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=637.68s)]
*  the super bowl title game year one with Alex Smith. Like I think he and McVeigh are the best [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=641.8399999999999s)]
*  living coaches and he'll do it this year. So 11 wins, they'd have to go four and oh against the [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=645.4399999999999s)]
*  two shit teams and split with the chiefs and go five and one. And then that's then that 11 becomes [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=650.2399999999999s)]
*  easy. All right. What do I, I agree with you on that one. What's number three? Number three is [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=655.92s)]
*  Mike Tomlin. So we talked a little bit about this. The Steelers has to win a playoff game this year. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=660.16s)]
*  And all anybody wants to talk about is that, Oh, Mike Tomlin's never had a losing record. He's never [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=666.96s)]
*  had a losing record. Like I completely disagree with you. Any Steelers fan will tell you that the [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=672.24s)]
*  postseason is the season and they're always on one on the postseason. He isn't one to set a playoff [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=676.32s)]
*  game in years, years. Like this goes back to like old Rochlesberger and he loved them and he can get [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=681.92s)]
*  you to nine to eight. Yeah. No, for real. It's like going back to all those guys who played, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=688.24s)]
*  he doesn't win in the playoffs. And it's like, he's one of those guys that everybody likes and [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=694.8s)]
*  everyone thinks like he's one of the best coaches. Well, hold on. If he's one of the best coaches, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=698.0799999999999s)]
*  how come he never wins playoff games? I know we like him and he's cool and everything, but [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=701.92s)]
*  I think he has to this year and what he's dealing with as we're talking about this, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=706.16s)]
*  it might've been announced by now. It's like a down to the wire, Justin Fields versus zombie [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=711.1999999999999s)]
*  Russell Wilson, true quarterback competition that no one seems to want. And this is what's going to [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=717.36s)]
*  be on the other side of TJ Watt this year. I think Tom and has to coach his ass up another [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=722.56s)]
*  year without a playoff win is like, I thought we were the Steelers. The counter is the quarterback [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=726.4799999999999s)]
*  situation he's been dealt with for the past six years is might be the worst. Like Rochlesberger's [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=731.1199999999999s)]
*  last three years were bad. Last two, I forget what it was two or three, but it was over. And then [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=737.28s)]
*  they had to keep throwing them out there. They did some Trubisky, Mason Rudolph, Mason Rudolph. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=744.0s)]
*  They did some Pickett, like Pickett's like battling right now to see if he's the number two or number [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=751.36s)]
*  three Eagles quarterback. He's probably gonna be number three. And then the two guys this year, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=755.76s)]
*  Wilson's been, Wilson doesn't want to get hit anymore. Like Denver's paying a shitload of money [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=759.84s)]
*  just so he's not on their team because he was just trying to get rid of the ball before he got hit. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=766.24s)]
*  And then Fields, who has become a pretty polarizing presence in football circles, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=770.64s)]
*  because some people are like, give him a chance. He's awesome. And I don't know, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=776.72s)]
*  it just seems like he fucks up half the time. So we'll find out if this is the best situation [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=780.4s)]
*  he's been in probably, right? From a weapons coaching standpoint, this is- [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=785.36s)]
*  It was bad with the Bears. Yeah. But this has got to be it. He's got, Arthur Smith is the new [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=790.24s)]
*  offensive coordinator, the old Falcons coach, the Titans. All he wants to do is run and hurt people [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=794.4s)]
*  and hit people. And you're like, all right, well, Fields can run really well. Let's do it. I've said, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=798.8s)]
*  I think he's going to win the job again. He might not, but like the Russell Wilson thing is so [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=803.04s)]
*  fascinating. Bill, four years ago, he was voted by his peers, that NFL 100 thing they do. He was [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=806.96s)]
*  the number two player in the entire NFL. And now he might be the number two quarterback for a [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=811.44s)]
*  Midland Steelers team. And to put it like in our terms, I feel like he has a Travolta thing where [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=816.0s)]
*  Seahawks was early Travolta. Denver was look who's talking Travolta. And like he needs Mike [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=823.6800000000001s)]
*  Tomlin to be his Tarantino and to have this Renaissance and unlock him and find it. And I [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=830.0s)]
*  don't think Tomlin's Tarantino and I don't think he's Travolta. Yeah. I think it's, I think it's [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=834.64s)]
*  been done for two years. I know the Travolta thing would be really fun, but I don't see a scenario [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=839.6s)]
*  because why wouldn't it have happened last year? Well, he's got Sean Payton who wanted to play. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=846.0s)]
*  He's a genius does this, does that. And it wasn't a match quote unquote. He didn't have the defense. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=850.96s)]
*  You have the running game. The thought was, okay, we have TJ Watt on the defense like the Steelers [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=855.68s)]
*  did. And we have a Najee Harris and Jalen Warren. They can be like Marshawn and we can like go back [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=860.08s)]
*  to how it used to get the band back together. Just not the same. It doesn't, he's not shown it at all. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=864.56s)]
*  Sometimes you lose it, man. I was saying last year, Darren Williams in basketball was like that too, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=869.52s)]
*  where he went from being like an all NBA guy to being like a guy that couldn't start in playoff [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=874.16s)]
*  games. The craziest thing, Bill, is that it's like Russell Wilson's life changed like on that goal [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=878.7199999999999s)]
*  line throw to the Patriots. He completes that throw. He's a Hall of Famer. He has two Super Bowls. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=885.1999999999999s)]
*  And it just kind of hasn't totally been the same since Malcolm Butler. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=890.1600000000001s)]
*  I am, there's some people that are in around the Pittsburgh, on Pittsburgh a little bit as a [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=895.2s)]
*  possible sleeper. I'm not one of those people. And I don't like the way they start the season either. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=899.12s)]
*  They go at Atlanta, at Denver home charges, at Indy first four, three road games out of the first four. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=903.0400000000001s)]
*  And you don't know if you have a quarterback or not. Not to mention the at Denver week too. If [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=911.6800000000001s)]
*  Wilson's the guy, like you know, Denver's gonna be fired up for that one, but I don't see it. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=917.12s)]
*  All right. Who's number two? All right. Number two is our guy, Bobby Sala. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=921.12s)]
*  We had a talk Jets, Robert Sala. It's like last year was the year. Oh, wait, hold on. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=926.4s)]
*  This is now. This is really the year guys. Like we have to win now for us, for the GM, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=933.04s)]
*  for the quarterback. I, I, I, I'm sorry. I'm name dropping so much. I ran into Sala a couple weeks [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=938.8s)]
*  ago, got to talk to him for a while. God, he is such a nice person. He's so polite and so intense. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=944.0s)]
*  And like, I know a lot of people are like, yeah, he's a nice person. I don't want that as the Jets [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=949.44s)]
*  head coach. I don't go that way, but like I am rooting so hard for him. His defense is amazing. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=953.04s)]
*  They're so talented and everybody knows like sauce and Quinn and whatnot. Like I don't even [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=959.68s)]
*  think people know that Quinn is Williams. Brother is on the same defense and he's amazing too. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=963.92s)]
*  The offense is loaded. It's just like everybody, every single person, even in the Jets building, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=968.96s)]
*  all they ever say is if we can stay healthy, we can win the Superbowl. We can do anything. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=974.24s)]
*  If we can stay healthy, we can stay healthy. I think they're right. I, I, I believe in Rogers, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=978.48s)]
*  probably to a fault. Wow. I just think it's because he bears the NA though. It's because I've been [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=982.48s)]
*  like whipped for him. We're, we're Rogers back to Tarantino. Like we're Rogers gimp. Like we have [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=988.1600000000001s)]
*  like the zipper mask on and we have for years. He does own us. I thought he was going to be MVP [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=992.96s)]
*  last year as a jet. I thought he was going to tie Peyton and it was over, but I think he'll be [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=997.04s)]
*  great. I just don't know. Like we'll see what Salah's got. We've never seen him as a head coach [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1001.28s)]
*  in December when you need to win a game to get into the playoffs. I'm just trying to figure out [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1005.52s)]
*  what the gimp in a bears Jersey, what was your, what was your take on the gimp? Whether that was [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1009.76s)]
*  like a nine to five job for him? Like he showed up at 10 and just climbed in the trunk or whether [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1015.68s)]
*  he was like their actual prisoner? I think he is there willingly. And so I think it is, I don't [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1020.0799999999999s)]
*  think he's a prisoner. I think he likes it. And I thought, I think he clocks in and they'd have to [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1026.08s)]
*  feed him and stuff like that. So I think it's like seven hours max in the trunk. Yeah. I actually [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1029.9199999999998s)]
*  think the gimp is like kind of like an eight millimeter, like, you know how the machine is [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1036.08s)]
*  like just this normal guy at the end with glasses. I think the gimp is like a librarian or something. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1039.28s)]
*  Just normal guy. He's a realtor, but I think cause he punches him. We talked about it in the pulp [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1043.36s)]
*  fiction pod and there was a Tarantino said how they, I didn't know this when we did the pod. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1047.4399999999998s)]
*  Somehow I missed it in my 130 hours of research, but Tarantino said he always thought of the gimp [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1052.56s)]
*  as like a hitchhiker. They picked up and made a prisoner out of, but I don't, I also don't think [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1057.6s)]
*  Tarantino in 93 was anticipating this internet culture that would come where every single moment [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1063.6s)]
*  of a movie is dissected. So even if he was their prisoners, so he's just in the train, he would [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1068.64s)]
*  just die in the trunk eventually. The game's body language though is it's not resistant. He doesn't [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1073.52s)]
*  seem scared. He kind of laughs at Butch, right? He's got Stockholm syndrome. It seems like if you're [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1079.12s)]
*  going with the hitchhiker thing, I like the idea of him showing up at nine, seeing Maynard like, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1083.6799999999998s)]
*  Hey man, Hey, just going downstairs. We'll see in a second. And then he just goes in the trunk and [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1089.4399999999998s)]
*  just kind of waits for the spider to catch a fly. And then he's like, Oh, game time. I'm not surprised [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1094.8s)]
*  that we are talking about the gimp somehow as we talk about the New York jets. I just think Sal is [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1100.9599999999998s)]
*  a bad coach. I haven't seen any evidence that he's good at it. I thought the way he handled the [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1107.84s)]
*  quarterback stuff last year was super weird. And I know you guys were getting material out of it on [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1112.56s)]
*  your show week after week, because it was like, he clearly didn't want Zach Wilson as his quarterback, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1117.84s)]
*  but also didn't seem to have the juice to change his destiny or was making it seem publicly like [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1123.04s)]
*  he was kind of okay. I just don't know what they were trying to accomplish. I've said it all year. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1130.8s)]
*  I just feel like if they had fired him in May and hired Mike Vrabel, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1135.68s)]
*  I think we'd all be picking them to either win the Superbowl or come close. And the fact that they [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1139.76s)]
*  have a coach that we've never seen him even have a winning record or be confident and a quarterback [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1144.16s)]
*  who hasn't been good in three years and who's turning 40. That's the case against them. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1150.56s)]
*  It is. And sometimes you can stay employed or you can stay in people's good graces by virtue of your [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1157.92s)]
*  personality. He is very, very good dude. He comes up with this crazy cool looking bald head. He's [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1163.6s)]
*  jacked as hell. He has a full six pack, all that stuff. And you're talking about Sal or Chris Ryan. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1170.32s)]
*  I lost track. Oh no, Sal. Chris Ryan is great. He's bulky right now. He's doing triangle pushups. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1175.12s)]
*  Yeah, great guy. I'm talking about Salah. And sometimes it's like, I don't know, I kind of [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1180.56s)]
*  like having Salah around and it'll get you an extra year, but there's no year after this. I think [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1185.04s)]
*  Salah will be gone short of them winning a playoff game. They have to win a playoff and [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1190.24s)]
*  they're the Jets. They never do. I think they are the single hardest team of the 32 to figure out. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1194.4s)]
*  Really? So are you, are you skeptical on Rogers? I still, Sal and I are doing that pot in a week [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1199.84s)]
*  and I still haven't decided where I landed on the Jets. I can't, I can't get there either way. And [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1204.56s)]
*  I think that from ceiling basement scenarios, I'm there on both sides. I can see them going 13 and [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1210.64s)]
*  four. I could see them going six and 11 and Salah getting fired in week six. And I don't know which [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1216.72s)]
*  way it goes. They have so much talent. Their offensive line is way better. Buffalo's worse. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1223.44s)]
*  Miami's kind of secretly might be a little bit of a mess and the Pats are just thrown this year away. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1228.88s)]
*  So, you know, you look at, even if you look at the schedule, like they play AFC South, NFC West, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1234.64s)]
*  which is a little dicey. They start the year at San Fran at Tennessee. Right. So we could be like, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1241.76s)]
*  oh and two. Oh my God. Who saw this coming? And, or you could go, oh, they beat San Francisco on [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1248.3999999999999s)]
*  Monday night. No McCaffrey. Oh my God. The Jets. They went in Tennessee. Then they had the Pats in [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1255.84s)]
*  Denver at home. Said the Jets are four and oh, I'm ready for any scenario with them. I can't figure [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1260.8s)]
*  it out. The week one's good because it's, it's the Rogers growing up in the San Francisco area [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1266.08s)]
*  storyline. The book is out. He grew up a Niners fan. I don't know if you knew this. They could [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1270.8s)]
*  have taken them. Yeah. They could have taken them. Number one, it's weird as it went out, they went [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1274.24s)]
*  to Alex. It's a well publicized story. Could have drafted them. Nobody, people haven't focused on [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1277.84s)]
*  that a lot. There's actually a video of him at the table not being drafted. We unearthed it recently. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1283.84s)]
*  Well, the other thing with Rogers is there's always like a possible, some sort of soap opera [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1287.52s)]
*  storyline two days before the season that you weren't expecting. Like something in November. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1293.52s)]
*  Or whatever. Yeah. It's just, and it's the Jets. You have the Jets karma. This is a team that Larry [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1298.72s)]
*  David once wrote an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm about a Jets fan dying and not knowing whether [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1303.52s)]
*  it was because of the Jets or not. But that was my question to you. Do you, do you have brand [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1309.12s)]
*  prejudice against the Jets? Like if the same roster and same coaches were on, I don't know, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1314.6399999999999s)]
*  like the Broncos or something, is it, do you have brand prejudice? I don't. The Patriots winning a [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1318.6399999999999s)]
*  Superbowl has, has taken to me, every team's on the table to win a title. Like I just don't believe [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1322.64s)]
*  in that stuff anymore. The only thing is when it gets a new, like the playoffs, there's a couple [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1328.5600000000002s)]
*  teams. I think the Vikings have hit a point where I just assume something's going to go wrong for [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1333.3600000000001s)]
*  them. And I think the Bills are still at that point. It just, there's certain teams that they [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1338.64s)]
*  have to show us. They can get over the hump before I'll believe it. The Jets have had good teams and [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1344.16s)]
*  good seasons and good wins. Like they've won a Patriot, they won at Gillette Stadium. They beat [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1349.44s)]
*  Belichick in New England. So I don't know. They made the conference title a couple of times. It's [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1354.72s)]
*  not inconceivable to me. They'd be good. No, listen, we live in a time right now when the Detroit [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1359.28s)]
*  Lions are amazing and they're like the biggest pieces of shit for 25, 30 years. So anybody can [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1364.0800000000002s)]
*  be amazing. But we talked to AFC East, mentioned the Patriots, we talked to the Jets, talked to [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1368.72s)]
*  Bills. My number one head coach this year, Mike McDaniel. And number one, for a bunch of reasons. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1373.6s)]
*  This is like the ultimate go time. Like you have to win a playoff game, maybe two playoff games. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1383.1999999999998s)]
*  We're past how charmed we are at your personality and you're eccentric and your team is really cool [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1388.3999999999999s)]
*  and fast and Tyreek this and you know, two is kind of interesting, but like you need to win [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1393.52s)]
*  playoff games this year. And my take on the Dolphins, especially last year, Bill's like, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1397.84s)]
*  they would just beat the shit out of all the bad teams and have all amazing highlights and 70 points [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1403.04s)]
*  and they'd be terrible against the good teams. Watching the Dolphins last year was like Instagram [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1408.1599999999999s)]
*  scrolling. You're just sitting there kind of numb to it and it's everything you like and it's every [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1413.52s)]
*  piece of dopamine that you like. And when you're done with it, after like an hour of scrolling, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1417.76s)]
*  you kind of feel sick and depressed about what you just did. And that was the Chiefs playoff [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1422.8799999999999s)]
*  game, which is one of the worst no-show playoff games in the 21st century. And it's the last taste [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1427.28s)]
*  in everybody's mouth. So they're great. They have fireworks and they have Coke, cola and dopamine [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1431.2s)]
*  and Instagram. But at the end, you're like, what is the nutritive value of what I just ate? They [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1436.88s)]
*  destroyed the shitty teams, lost to the good ones and then did nothing in a playoff game. I think [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1441.1200000000001s)]
*  they have a lot to prove. And it starts with like one of the most interesting head coaches we've [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1445.2s)]
*  ever had. And can two stay healthy again? Yeah. And is two a really good like, can he win a big game? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1448.56s)]
*  Tyreek just got paid. You've already seen weird Tyreek games. One year, two years, like [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1456.0s)]
*  we've already seen these weird games where it's like he's slipping off the film. He's back. His [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1461.3600000000001s)]
*  helmet's off. His helmet's back on. The cold weather stuff with them. It's true. Everyone wanted [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1465.76s)]
*  to say last year, it's bullshit. It's bullshit. No teams are cold weather teams. Like they're fast. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1472.72s)]
*  They're well coached. It was one of the worst playoff games you've ever seen. They didn't want [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1476.72s)]
*  to be there. And Tyreek didn't look like Tyreek. And like, but then people start, you know, two is [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1479.8400000000001s)]
*  from Hawaii and Alabama. Like you can't play in the cold. You think like that's nonsense. But then [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1484.32s)]
*  the game was really bad. And I think no team needs to win a playoff game more this year than [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1489.04s)]
*  them. I mean, take away the front runners, obviously, but of the up and comers, like you [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1494.6399999999999s)]
*  can't go, they'd be three years in a row with Mike McDaniel being crowned as the next great coach. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1498.48s)]
*  And he hasn't had a playoff win. Sean Bay came in and started winning playoff games fast. Kyle [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1502.24s)]
*  Shanahan started winning playoff games fast. Jim Harbaugh will get to playoff games and win them [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1506.6399999999999s)]
*  fast. Like Mike McDaniel, we all want to root for you. You're such a cool guy. Good story. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1510.6399999999999s)]
*  You can't keep losing in the wild card around. All right. So I'll make a list off your list. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1514.56s)]
*  Yeah. For me, Harbaugh's first. Great. I love it. I just think having him and McVeigh in the same [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1519.6s)]
*  city, even if it's a city that barely realizes as a football team, it's just crazy that the two most [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1527.28s)]
*  interesting coaches are in the same city. I hope they have a rivalry. I hope somebody says something [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1531.76s)]
*  shitty about the other guy. And then I think, I think the Tomlin points you made were great because [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1536.4s)]
*  he is the most respected and like coach. I include myself because I always feels like they end up [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1542.4s)]
*  going 10 and seven somehow. Yeah. But I can't remember a single positive playoff moment they've [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1549.2s)]
*  had. I always felt like the Patriots are going to beat them when, when we had our actual team. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1554.16s)]
*  And how many years in a row can you just do this? And be the Supreme Court justice. Like he's just, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1558.8s)]
*  you just leave him alone. The Steelers hire coaches for 30 years, but I know there's a fatigue [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1564.56s)]
*  amongst Steelers fans about like, we're not a 10 and seven organization. It might just be a change [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1568.96s)]
*  of scenery thing for him, right? Where like Andy Reid had that long run in Philly, had a lot of [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1572.88s)]
*  success, but they never got over the hump. And then he had that one bad season. They were like, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1578.64s)]
*  okay. And that was it. All of a sudden he was in Kansas city. So I think there's the potential of [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1582.64s)]
*  that this year. I don't like the Wilson's field saying at all. I think that's going to be bad. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1586.88s)]
*  All right, Kyle Brandt, we can see you on good morning football. We can see you continue to [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1590.96s)]
*  see in the rewatchables. Listen to us talk about Rudy this week. If you haven't already, great to [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1594.4s)]
*  see you. Good to see you too, man. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkVt8HCb9Y&t=1598.64s)]
