# The Beginning of the End for Deion Sanders in Colorado? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [May 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qqHJ-T3xO8)
*  What's happening in Colorado right now is, to me,
*  one of the more embarrassing situations that I've seen
*  in any sports organization ever.
*  Like, they don't have an identity,
*  they don't have any institutional control,
*  their coach is on Twitter going at it.
*  I love Deion Sanders so much,
*  but it doesn't seem as if Deion Sanders knows what it takes
*  to be a college football coach at that level.
*  He's learning on a job to such a degree,
*  he's engaging in Twitter beefs against college kids.
*  They're losing recruits to the transfer portal
*  left and right.
*  No one really knows what they're building around
*  or what they're doing.
*  Are they an offensive team, are they a defensive team?
*  I mean, they're certainly not a defensive team.
*  Are they explosive, are they methodical?
*  And it's all kind of, it's like an empty swag burger,
*  like a swag burger with no meat, no cheese,
*  no nothing on that, no protein.
*  It's just all condiments.
*  An empty swag burger.
*  An empty swag burger, swag burger, no meat.
*  It's like you dress it up and you boom,
*  there's nothing in the middle of it.
*  So I'm actually-
*  That's like what Cousin Eddie made in vacation?
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  There's no meat, they can't afford the meat right now.
*  And so to me, I'm actually,
*  it's getting to the point to where,
*  you know, it's a little embarrassing
*  for what's going on at Colorado.
*  And if they limp it to another four and eight season,
*  it's gonna be embarrassing in a big way.
*  You have thoughts, Priscilla?
*  He was on 60 Minutes, he was on the cover of Time Magazine.
*  They came in last place in their conference.
*  It was a fun little story when they had the comeback
*  against Colorado State.
*  They beat TCU and people framed it
*  as they beat the defending national champ, Co-Runner-Up,
*  when TCU was a completely different team.
*  So part of me was rooting it for it to work,
*  and then it became very political
*  that if you didn't like Deion, it was for a specific reason.
*  And then if you did like Deion, it was for a different reason.
*  And it just, I don't know, man,
*  it just got kind of like baked into this big stew
*  when I think that it's the same for everybody.
*  If you get a ton of attention
*  and the team ends up stinking,
*  people resent the attention you got.
*  And that's all I think it is.
*  I liked it as it was happening
*  because I thought it was fun.
*  College football was just completely imploding,
*  and then this guy was coming in
*  as almost the catalyst for some of that implosion,
*  the way he was approaching building the program.
*  I was like, I'm in, this is fun
*  because college football is a fucking mess anyway.
*  But it seems like, it just doesn't seem like,
*  remember we did that segment, Van,
*  when we were talking about where he'll go next?
*  That was like the height of the Deion mania.
*  But now it's like, I almost feel like the way it's playing out,
*  he's probably just on TV in a year.
*  Well, I mean, when you start to really get into it,
*  that's when I knew it wasn't gonna work.
*  When you started to like, when I started to see you
*  and you're into college football now,
*  and that's kind of the thing,
*  that's when I was like, this is gonna crack.
*  This is bad. There's no way.
*  Then we don't want casual Bill
*  involved in our college football for Saturday.
*  That's when I started to identify,
*  oh, this is the college football fan
*  that's actually all over Colorado.
*  You know what I mean?
*  This is what I'll say.
*  There is a unique opportunity here though.
*  The unique opportunity for Deion Sanders in Colorado
*  is that the expectations are right back where they were
*  at the beginning of last season.
*  So they're in the big 12 now.
*  Being in the big 12, a lot of people think that
*  because there's no marquee team in the big 12 right now
*  that they're going to have a pushover there.
*  No, you're gonna deal with a lot of teams
*  that have a lot of program stability
*  in terms of the way they turn out their athletes.
*  You're not gonna be dealing with a whole bunch
*  of big time five stars,
*  but I was listening to Josh Pay talk about this
*  and he was saying is you're gonna deal with a bunch
*  of teams that are manufacturing starters.
*  So three years you get a starter
*  and those people know how to play football.
*  But still though, the talent gap between them
*  and some of the other teams is not gonna be
*  there so if they peel off a couple victories,
*  particularly early in the season,
*  we're gonna go right back to Colorado is back.
*  That's not the problem, that's not the question.
*  The question is through a recruiting class,
*  through a culture, what's the culture in Colorado right now?
*  Through a recruiting class, through a culture,
*  and through momentum, can you build something
*  that's sustainable?
*  And it just seems like there's a lot of chaos
*  over there right now.
*  I love Deion Sanders for all the reasons
*  I should love Deion Sanders
*  to some of those reasons Rusilo was talking about.
*  I do, but I also love college football
*  and I can't turn a blind eye to the fact
*  that the way you're doing, the way you do
*  what they're trying to do, it just doesn't work.
*  You can't build a line through Transfer Portal,
*  you can supplement through Transfer Portal,
*  you can't build a whole program through it,
*  et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,
*  et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
*  Rusilo, where is Deion in 2026?
*  If he still wants to be there
*  and they're better than they were last year,
*  they'd probably be like, look,
*  this is probably about as good as we can do
*  for a program that was one of the worst programs
*  in college football for a long time.
*  I don't know what the new Big 12 is gonna look like.
*  It could seem more wide open, but I was rooting for him
*  because I was glad that a program did something
*  this outside of the box.
*  Like you screw up with this offensive coordinator
*  who's on a seventh team all the time.
*  You know what I mean?
*  There's plenty of failures to go with the normal model,
*  so try the different model.
*  That's why I was so excited for Antonio Pierce.
*  Even though the Jeff Saturday thing didn't work,
*  I wanted it to work for Antonio Pierce and I was thrilled.
*  And I know it's a little different with Deion,
*  so I was rooting for it.
*  But he just can't help himself sometimes.
*  And I think when you're gonna talk that much shit
*  and asking people in the media, hey, do you believe?
*  Do you believe?
*  And then it's like, well, it's not my fucking job to believe.
*  I'm just here to cover the game.
*  And then they stink.
*  We love attention in college football.
*  We love the energy.
*  We love the luncheons and the boosters
*  and everybody get really excited.
*  But it's like, all right, go out and tackle somebody
*  every Saturday and play some defense.
*  But it was only one year in, so we'll see what happens.
*  But it was a wave of, if you're not on board,
*  you're a hater.
*  And it's like, I don't think I'm a hater.
*  I'd be surprised if you were gonna end up being that good.
*  And then when you looked at the portal grade,
*  I was like, maybe they are gonna be this good
*  as they started the season.
*  Then you realize they couldn't play any defense
*  and the offense fell apart and all these things went south.
*  And look, if you wanna find guys that transfer out
*  that are gonna shit talk the previous program,
*  like get in line.
*  The athletic did that huge piece on all these guys
*  and where they are now.
*  And some of the stories were sad,
*  but it's also kind of the way college football goes.
*  You can find recruits from everywhere else that have gone,
*  oh, this new guy came in and I left
*  and I went through all this and I hate those guys
*  and here's my quote.
*  You can find all that kind of stuff.
*  I just couldn't put it.
*  Like this guy Joe Burrow.
*  Yeah, but look, there were guys MF'ing Saban
*  in that O17 being like, this guy coming in here,
*  telling me you're gonna change it all over.
*  So I hope it works out for him.
*  But I think the lines have been drawn
*  where there are gonna be some that absolutely just revel
*  if he fails again.
*  And then I would think if they get off to a good start,
*  maybe some people will chill about what it actually means.
*  Do you know what I really hope though?
*  Last thing I say.
*  What I hope is that for Colorado,
*  what I hope and for Deion Sanders
*  is that everything that he and the program purports to be,
*  that they really mean it.
*  Because I know a lot of people, take my mother for example,
*  and this is actually a very important thing to say culturally
*  for someone like my mom.
*  When my mom thinks about Deion Sanders,
*  my mother thinks not about football.
*  She thinks about God and she thinks about family
*  because that's what Deion Sanders tells you.
*  He says God, he says family.
*  And those are beautiful, amazing things,
*  especially when you're gonna send your son somewhere.
*  And so when she watches the games and she's all into it
*  and the games aren't going the way that they're going
*  and she sees some certain things,
*  it starts to be like she actually was emotionally let down
*  by how Colorado's season ended
*  because it didn't seem like it was about
*  what she thought it was about.
*  The more she got into it
*  and she's reading these athletic articles
*  and she's sending stuff to me,
*  she's like, well, he's supposed to be a daddy
*  and a father figure to these young men
*  and it's supposed to be about more than that.
*  And she feels abandoned by him
*  and she doesn't quite get the business of college football
*  and how it's supposed to go
*  or everything Ryan's saying is true.
*  But you wanna believe in what the standard there
*  is supposed to be.
*  And as hard as this is,
*  the field will actually be a referendum on that.
*  It will be because if you're willing to stick it out,
*  if you can stick it out with players
*  and develop them and doing all of this,
*  you'll start to see that on the field.
*  But if it's always firing this guy,
*  quick fix, pointing the finger at someone
*  and passing the book on someone,
*  you'll see a staccato, weird, bad season
*  over and over again for them.
*  So if their fundamentals are real, they'll have success.
*  But no one can know right now if they are or not.
*  It also could be a mess too, right?
*  Like if you wanna believe the bad stuff,
*  you could be like, it's a TV show, it's a reality show.
*  It's all about Dion, it's not really about the kids.
*  And this is all bullshit and it's all hype
*  and all these things.
*  You hear enough of it, but then again,
*  you're like, all right, is that criticism specific to him?
*  Or whatever, I don't know, but there's a lot of evidence
*  that that might be true and then three years later,
*  we're going, remember that?
*  Right, yeah.
*  Well, it's like when, remember when Paul Westhead
*  coached the Nuggets in the early 90s?
*  And he tried that crazy offensive style
*  and he just got torched and then that was it.
*  Then a few years later, it's like,
*  remember that Paul Westhead thing?
*  Dion's not gonna be like that with Colorado, right?
*  It won't be that bad.
*  No, I mean, yeah, like look.
*  I mean, they did go like, what are they,
*  one of their last nine?
*  They won one game in their last nine last year, right?
*  But the thing that was bothersome about that is
*  anyone who had watched college football
*  could see that coming.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Anybody who had watched the sport could see that coming.
*  Even, you know, they win a huge double overtime game,
*  huge in terms of how it was Ballyhoo.
*  And TV rating.
*  Huge double overtime game against Colorado State.
*  I know it's a rivalry game, but I'm like, no,
*  if these guys are a top 20, top 15 team,
*  probably shouldn't have went to double OT in Boulder
*  against a team that's not gonna have very many guys
*  hear their names called when the draft comes.
*  So you knew that they were going to struggle
*  when they got to conference plate,
*  but they didn't just struggle.
*  They completely got pulled apart at the seams.
*  There was in-fighting.
*  There was coaching changes.
*  There was backbiting.
*  There was chirping out of the locker room.
*  The wheels completely fell off.
*  Not even just good losses, just it looked bad.
*  No adjustments being made the whole nine.
*  And you started to ask the question is, love Dion,
*  love his family, love everybody over there,
*  but the question starts to be like, what are we really doing?
*  And also something else I'll say before,
*  another thing is the sycophantic way in which he's covered
*  is not helping Colorado.
*  It's not.
*  I watched Undisputed and it doesn't matter
*  what the fuck happens.
*  You watched Undisputed?
*  The clips come up on YouTube.
*  Were you sick that day?
*  Jesus.
*  Okay, I wanted this.
*  But I'm just saying.
*  Did you watch the episode when it asked if Colorado
*  was Black America's team?
*  I have to tape this one.
*  Yeah, that's what wrote me in.
*  So I watched it.
*  Kalika, where's the remote?
*  I gotta press record.
*  That's what got me in there.
*  But I watched it and I loved those.
*  Y'all see?
*  Now when Keeshawn come out and start dissing Bill,
*  Bill, you don't want to smoke?
*  But what I'm saying is I watch it
*  and no one's keeping it real.
*  Everybody's like Colorado lost 59 to seven last night
*  and you hear Skip Bayless go,
*  but golly, that's seven points.
*  Jesus Christ, with those kids out there hustling,
*  you can tell that he's a leader of men out there.
*  In the future, they're gonna be able to cut that margin
*  to 14.
*  I'm like, what the fuck is going on?
*  Just keep it real.
*  This shit not going well.
*  And that'll light a fire under them
*  to maybe change some shit up.
*  So I can't do the thing where I'm tepid
*  in my criticism of Dion anymore.
*  It doesn't, I can't do it.
*  For cultural reasons or any other reasons, I can't.
