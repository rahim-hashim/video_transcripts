# C.J. Stroudâ€™s Historical Rookie Year and Struggling Bryce Young | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [November 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVVV8FSfNQ)
*  CJ Stroud was just spectacular and unbelievable.
*  We were on it.
*  I remember I said before the draft, we did some, me and Solak and Danny Kelly did some
*  draft stuff and I know nothing.
*  I barely follow college football.
*  You follow up, but I don't.
*  I was just like, CJ Stroud.
*  I don't see it.
*  I don't see a quarterback with an initial name.
*  We've had AJ Feely and we had AJ McCarran.
*  I was like, I just said, we've never had it.
*  It makes me nervous.
*  P.F. Chang had like one good year.
*  It was great that year.
*  But we knew within two weeks, we were like, this guy, we were saying it on the pod.
*  This guy has it.
*  Today, 30 for 42, 475 touchdowns.
*  Had two game winning drives in the last like five minutes.
*  For the season, 14 touchdowns, one interception.
*  And I went and looked up.
*  Is does he have a chance to have the best rookie QB season ever?
*  There's not a lot of not a lot of.
*  Marino.
*  Yeah.
*  Who else is a marino?
*  So I looked that up.
*  I thought I had in my head, it was marino in 1984, but it was actually the 83 year.
*  He only started nine games.
*  He threw 20 touchdowns, six picks.
*  Yeah.
*  Minshew had 21 touchdowns, six picks.
*  Russell Wilson had a great one.
*  He was 26 TDs, 10 picks threw for 31 18.
*  Your guy, Dak, 23 touchdowns, four picks, 36 67.
*  RG three.
*  Yeah, that's the one.
*  When he touched down five picks, 3,200.
*  And then Herbert had a shockingly good rookie season, which I had forgotten.
*  He's the only one that threw for over 4,000.
*  RG three had like 800, 800 yards rushing to seven touchdowns that year.
*  Yeah.
*  Herbert was 31 and 10, but Stroud's now on pace for it's not going to, he's not going
*  to do this, but 28 touchdowns and two picks would be the pace.
*  And when you watch it, like they're great throws.
*  It's not, this isn't like a machine of an offense.
*  Like he's hitting dudes over the shoulder catches, sitting them deep.
*  He's scrambling out and finding people like, it's like jaw dropping how good he is as a
*  rookie.
*  And it's hard for me to believe we spend this much time on the draft and people didn't think,
*  you know, we were like, Hey, he might be a bust Ohio state.
*  And then we'll love us.
*  It was really good on Thursday.
*  Again, I, I'm in on that guy too.
*  We just, we cannot figure out the draft.
*  I know.
*  I don't know why we can't at this point.
*  It's a, but there are more, we should be either that, or there shouldn't be 15 more
*  experts every year.
*  It seems like more draft experts than ever.
*  And yet we don't know if we'll love us as good or young is better than Stroud.
*  And yeah, young just looks like a college quarterback right out there.
*  You know, like that.
*  Well, they can't block for him.
*  So it's, I, yeah, it's hard for me to know what he is yet because it just seems like
*  he's getting hit.
*  He's running and he's running for his life at the time.
*  Team's not very good.
*  I have to say I'm completely, I'm numb to what's a good quarterback.
*  Anymore.
*  I think like Gardner Minshew was good.
*  Like somebody like, Oh no, no, that guy's good.
*  That guy's a good quarterback.
*  Like really?
*  Or is everybody bad?
*  Like, no, he's good.
*  I can't tell.
*  We watched those 10 AM games on the West coast.
*  It's like, this is awful.
*  Shit.
*  Why can't anybody step up?
*  At least Minshew has some sort of performance history where he's been competent for longer
*  stretches, you know, right.
*  Where somebody like Trubisky just never had it.
*  But yeah, I, if I had to say who does CJ, well, I'll ask you first and I'll give you
*  my answer.
*  Who does CJ Strad remind you of when you watch him?
*  I think like a more poised RG three.
*  That's what, that's why I kind of brought him up after you brought him up.
*  But that's why I would say, and just runs a little less, but a more poised RG three.
*  What would you say?
*  He reminds me of a Russell Wilson in like the probably like year four, year five range
*  when he started to get more of a command of flinging it around.
*  Where that's a great compliment.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Where you just feel like if he has time to throw, he's just going to zing it and find
*  people.
*  But for the most part, like he's not that big of a guy.
*  I don't feel like, like I like Nico Collins.
*  I like Dell.
*  They don't, their receiver, I mean, their running backs are pretty below average
*  because Pierce has been kind of out for most of the season.
*  But I'm blown away by that dude.
*  Like they're for them to be four and four, they were what?
*  Plus nine 50 to win or plus 20 to one to win the AFC South before the season.
*  Yeah.
*  The other weird thing.
*  They're going to grab that seven from the bills.
*  Aren't they?
*  It's really possible.
*  Here's the other thing.
*  They had almost 500 yards, 496 yards.
*  Yeah.
*  And they went three for 11 on first down.
*  Explain that to me.
*  How do you have almost 500 yards?
*  You have three third down conversions.
*  Wow.
*  Something happened in this game.
*  That was unbelievable that I missed because we had all the games going on.
*  They go for two.
*  Not really.
*  And it's like, yeah, it's like, what the fuck are they doing?
*  They don't get it.
*  Then later on, same thing.
*  It's 23, 22.
*  They go for two again.
*  I'm like, this is the analytics running.
*  I don't realize their kicker cert.
*  But then later some guy comes in.
*  Who was that guy who kicked the field goal for them?
*  They showed him.
*  Yeah, they showed him.
*  Number 33.
*  Right.
*  And so they line him up because it was fourth and too long to go for it.
*  They were like on the 10.
*  And then he kicks the field goal.
*  Right.
*  He made it.
*  It was the most exciting moment of the day.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't understand.
*  I'm going to do a bigger thing about this on Cousins House winning weekend, but
*  why is the punter not the backup kicker?
*  What the hell are punters doing?
*  What are they doing?
*  First of all, everybody goes on fourth and five now.
*  So the punters job is diminished.
*  I think you could help out and learn how to kick an extra point while you're doing
*  nothing.
*  Can you make a 30 yard something just in case?
*  Yeah.
*  What is it an ego thing?
*  Like the kick, the accuracy, the accuracy, the accuracy, the accuracy, the
*  actual kickers get mad if the punters try field goals in practice, because it seems
*  like the punters should be the go to guy and you don't work, you know, you don't
*  get the backup running back in there.
*  Kicking what's more exciting for you, the, the non kicker taking a 30 yard field
*  goal in a pressure game or a position player coming in and like the 19th ending
*  of a playoff game because the team ran out of pitchers.
*  Oh, uh,
*  I like the field goal thing.
*  I mean, didn't you, you have the best example ever with Doug Flutie did it.
*  And it wasn't out of, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Now he was just showing off.
*  I think the other piece was I bet in, I didn't have them in million dollar picks,
*  but I had them in real life.
*  The Texans minus three.
*  Right.
*  And once there's two point conversion, chicane or you just like, ah, I'm going
*  to get screwed.
*  I just wonder how it's going to happen.
*  They scored to take the lead.
*  They go up to, and there's like six seconds left and they, this was the right
*  move because God only knows what's going to happen when you're an, if you feel
*  go kicker to try to kick the PIT, they just decided to kneel.
*  So they wanted by two and then rooting for the lateral fumble touchdown for the
*  cover at the end.
*  Don't get it.
*  And then it's like, I was right about this game and I still lost.
*  Like what happened?
*  We just a good going CJ.
*  Oh, I know you have a thousand yards passing today, but no, no, no, you can't
*  be out here for this play.
*  Go, go sit down.
*  Right.
*  And you just, you just deal this for next week.
*  Yeah.
*  What an amazing game.
*  And then on the flip side, Bryce young throws the two pick sixes against the
*  Colts and, um, which kind of a winnable game for them.
*  Um, tough one for the CJ Stroud versus Bryce young thing.
*  I'd be interested.
*  I know we can't do this, but if you just flip those guys, what it would look like.
*  Yeah.
*  Like if it was on Houston, are they foreign for, I would say no.
*  No, I don't think so.
*  I think he's, I know what you're saying.
*  It's too young.
*  They don't block for him, but his timing just seems way off for NFL standards.
*  Yeah.
*  He seems small.
