# Is Deion Sanders Doomed at Colorado? With Van Lathan  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBLq3sn4Zn4)
*  All right. Since we have been on the pod, we got to rip through a couple of topics.
*  Dionne, Colorado, go.
*  Getting as bad as it could possibly get right now.
*  You predicted this this summer.
*  Yeah, it just didn't seem like a lot of the issues that were present
*  on the team from last year had actually been fixed.
*  And you're looking at the same stuff. You're looking at offensive line problems.
*  You're looking at defensive line problems. You're looking at the inability to cover.
*  The team is, of course, very top heavy. I'm not saying anything that anybody hasn't said.
*  And even some of the guys that broke out in the first game of the season, like Jimmy Horn,
*  did not do really that much against Nebraska. It seems like in a situation with him, he really
*  shows out against lesser competition, against competition where guys can cover. And maybe the
*  scheme is better. He has some problems. But more so to the point now, when you look at Colorado,
*  I'm starting to see stuff that maybe I didn't see as much last season, like on the field,
*  like Travis Hunter in that game against Nebraska, where they were thoroughly dominated,
*  seemed like he was fed up, like he wasn't actually believing.
*  Because one thing I will say is for all the struggles that they had last year,
*  you saw some cracks and stuff like that in terms of the coaching staff and stuff. But
*  the team seemed like they had a great bond between them. It seemed like they were
*  OK with one another. There was always some different dust ups and you heard stuff coming
*  up, but it wasn't until the summer that you got all this information about just how fractured the
*  locker room could be or might be. And so now you have to wonder what's going to happen with
*  the Colorado experience. And you have to wonder like where it's going. Why do people care so much?
*  Because it's interesting. If you have to condense it down in one sentence,
*  why do people care about this team that's basically a below 500 college football team?
*  Because we love Deion Sanders. There are a couple of people in every sporting generation that rise
*  to the level of mythic figure. And Deion Sanders is one of those people. Deion Sanders is a guy that
*  locked down one half of the whole field, becomes a huge pop culture star. Prime time. He's great at
*  baseball. He's great at football. He's a generational athlete, but he's not just a
*  generational athlete. He's a generational talker. He's a generational cultural figure. He's a
*  generational style figure. He just means something to someone. And then to see Deion Sanders'
*  maturation when he's finished with his playing career and he becomes a leader and a man of God
*  and a family man and a father, you just believe that Deion will win at whatever Deion decides to do.
*  And he will win. Deion Sanders will win. What will happen is this.
*  Colorado, Travis Hunter will get drafted high. Shadua will get drafted high. Deion Sanders will
*  walk away with Colorado, from Colorado, tens of millions of dollars richer than what he was when
*  he got there. And his son will go to the NFL and his adoptive son will go to the NFL. Deion Sanders
*  will win. The question is whether or not Colorado will win, whether or not they will be markedly
*  better off after Deion Sanders leaves besides the financial. I'm talking about on the football field
*  and I don't think that they will be. I liked it last year. We talked about it a year ago
*  because I just hate the college sports infrastructure. I was so excited. Somebody
*  was coming in and was just like, fuck this and just blowing it up and zagging in the hardest
*  possible way. And I was like, I hope this works. And now a year later, it feels like we're headed
*  toward what you just laid out. It's going to get a couple of kids drafted. He's going to leave.
*  I don't know what's next for him. Like what's next for him?
*  I mean, it depends. If he wanted to continue to be a college coach,
*  remember he had great success at Jackson State for what they were doing at Jackson State. He
*  won the Swap twice. So it's not like he hasn't ever been successful as a college coach.
*  If he wants to continue to be a college coach and broken record, everybody is saying this,
*  it would take the demonstration of building a program that maintains a competitive and
*  structural consistency that people can believe in. Deion Sanders and Matt Ruhl came in at the same
*  time. He beat Matt Ruhl last year. He beat Matt Ruhl last year because Matt Ruhl is the coach
*  of Nebraska. He beat Matt Ruhl last year because Nebraska turned the ball over a lot.
*  Also, there was a little fool's gold in there. But now when you look at the team,
*  one team was essentially 28 points better. The game was 28-10, but it wasn't that close.
*  One team was way better in the trenches at doing the little things, made less mistakes,
*  the entire nine. So it seems that one way is winning over the other way. So Deion Sanders
*  would have to prove that he could really do this at this level. And he just hasn't proven that yet.
*  He's proven that he can be noticed, that he can be disruptive, that he can garner headlines,
*  that he can win in spots or have success in spots. But he has yet to prove that he can
*  win consistently at that level. And it's just a fact. Yeah, you're basically running your own
*  little mini corporation. Yeah, I mean, the reality is there are all kinds of guys. For example,
*  Marcus Freeman right now at Notre Dame, great young coach, great young coach. Notre Dame ends
*  up losing a weird game every single year that they shouldn't lose. They just lost Northern Illinois,
*  they lose to Marshall, they lose to a three and nine Stanford team. And you wonder, what is it
*  about this guy's process? Brian Kelly at my school at LSU, my beloved LSU Tigers, we come out stagnant
*  and flat at the beginning of the season every single year. We lose big games when the lights
*  are on us. And you wonder, not that Brian Kelly can't be a successful coach. He's one of the most
*  successful coaches of his generation. But what is it about these guys' process and preparation
*  to where they lose in situations like this, or they can't get over the hump in situations like this?
*  And Deion Sanders doesn't have nearly the accolades or the winning percentage of those other two guys.
*  But if we're asking those questions about those guys, we're certainly going to ask those questions
*  about him. Well, a year ago, you came on and we were talking about if this Colorado thing keeps
*  going the way it's going, what's next for Deion? What would be it? I think you did a top five
*  programs you'd want him to take over. Now it feels like the ceiling of that is lowered.
*  Right. You'd have to be a moronical. You'd have to be a moron. What it looked like at the time was
*  this. What it looked like at the time was that Deion Sanders had the ability to catch lightning
*  in the bottom and make everybody want to come to where he was and participate in this. And that he
*  was going to attract the best athletes. He had Travis Hunter. He was able to get Travis Hunter
*  to not go to Florida State, come to Jackson State. So you felt like his ability to do that was going
*  to turn a situation to where he didn't have as many resources as some of these other programs
*  and make Colorado automatically competitive, which it looked like. TCU, Nebraska, it looked like he
*  could do more with less. Now it's starting to look like that he can do less with more
*  because the school has been financially successful. Right. They're getting all eyes on them every
*  single time. The lights are on Colorado. The attention is there, but the team can't function.
*  So it doesn't look like resources are an indicator of how good of a coach or how good of a job he's
*  going to do. So if he ended up at Florida State or if he ended up at a Notre Dame or any of the
*  places where these coaches are, quote unquote, on the hot seat, which I don't think Norvell or
*  Freeman is actually on the hot seat. But if he ended up at any of those places, it doesn't look
*  like he has the institutional consistency to run them well. I'm not saying that that's true. It's
*  year two for Deion, but I'm saying the team is not just that the team is losing. It's how they lose.
*  They lose not they lose at the fundamentals of football. You have to do right. Yeah. So
*  it's it's really right now outside of opening game loss, the loss that they had to Nebraska.
*  I mean, Bill, that's as bad as it can go. And if you're for all the people out there that
*  because there's a part of this, there's, you know, you shouldn't say this because there's
*  a cultural loyalty to Deion. I love Deion. I love what he's been able to do. Love him as all of
*  that. But like, if you're looking at the results on the field, he hasn't proven that he's a great
*  coach at this level. It's just a fact. And it might be a level below. We'll see.
