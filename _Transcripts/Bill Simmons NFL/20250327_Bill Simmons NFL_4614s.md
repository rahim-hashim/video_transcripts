# 2025 NFL Over/Unders w/ Cousin Sal - a Guess The Lines Special! | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=0.0s)]
*  Tipping this on a Thursday, cousin Sal is here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=0.5s)]
*  Normally we just play guest the Lions during the NFL season. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2.64s)]
*  We haven't seen Sal since the Superbowl, the saddest look on his face every year, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=5.88s)]
*  knowing that it's come to an end. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=10.16s)]
*  And now we came up with a new idea Thursday. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=12.08s)]
*  I'm doing a pod. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=14.6s)]
*  You were available. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=15.88s)]
*  Fandle dropping NFL over under win totals. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  So we said last night, I'm not going to look, you're not going to look. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=20.72s)]
*  And we're going to do guest the lines. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=25.28s)]
*  We made our guesses and we go through every team and see and see what our [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=26.84s)]
*  instincts were. What do you think? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=29.8s)]
*  This is a spectacular day, a new day in our calendar. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=31.16s)]
*  Hopefully we can keep doing this. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=35.32s)]
*  I mean, I've been sick all week. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=36.84s)]
*  I was in Vegas. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=38.28s)]
*  I come back from Vegas. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=39.16s)]
*  I'm sick every time now. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=40.2s)]
*  It's like, yeah, come back with syphilis. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  I just have a cold. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=43.0s)]
*  It doesn't help being next to nephew. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=44.28s)]
*  Kyle fires up like 37 lung darts in 18 hours. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=46.16s)]
*  It kills my throat. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=50.0s)]
*  But anyway, I got some pep in my step. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=50.8s)]
*  This is one of the five. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=53.16s)]
*  If they should do this, Fandle should release the win total over [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=54.28s)]
*  unders the last Thursday in March. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  This would be one of the five best non football sports days of the year. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=61.36s)]
*  I mean, between March madness, the four sweet 16 games, opening day [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=65.56s)]
*  baseball and preseason over under win totals. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=69.12s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, this is great. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=73.04s)]
*  Yeah, we should have gone live. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  This should have been an event. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=76.56s)]
*  It should have been like when the NFL releases the schedule, right? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=77.72s)]
*  We should have been the one announcing the Fandle over unders for each team. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=80.76s)]
*  Try and guess what they were. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=84.44s)]
*  Yeah, we'll work on this. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=85.52s)]
*  I think next year we can do an even bigger version of it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=86.55999999999999s)]
*  I know you go right from football just to a series of, uh, of wagering on sports. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=89.32s)]
*  You don't really know that well. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  There's a basketball like you're, you're, I'm sure you made a shitload of preseason [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=97.32s)]
*  baseball bets, March madness. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=100.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=103.52s)]
*  You got some golf coming. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  There's some weird tennis stuff happening. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=105.39999999999999s)]
*  What's the dumbest thing you've been on in the last six years? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=106.96s)]
*  Joker in the Miami open. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=109.36s)]
*  I have to wake up and bet soccer and now there's like, you have to have like nine [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=111.12s)]
*  streaming services to have the, the, all the soccer capabilities for the world to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=114.88s)]
*  worldwide gamble on it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=119.8s)]
*  But, um, yeah, that's basically it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=121.32s)]
*  Just nonsensical soccer in the morning. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=123.48s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=126.24s)]
*  Like, like what country, what region of the world are we in? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=126.56s)]
*  All of them, all of them, the ones, all the parts of the world. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=129.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=132.88s)]
*  Is Greenland a country or did they belong to us now? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=133.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=135.8s)]
*  I, I bet it all. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=136.16s)]
*  It's a continent. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=137.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=138.12s)]
*  Did that, are they are 51st state? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=138.4s)]
*  I haven't checked. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=140.0s)]
*  Are our cherished 51st state? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=140.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=142.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=142.8s)]
*  Were you able to bet on Stephen A versus LeBron? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=143.44s)]
*  Is there like a future bet there? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=146.84s)]
*  Who's favored? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=148.24s)]
*  Stephen, make no mistake. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=149.52s)]
*  Stephen A would swing at him. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=151.32s)]
*  He would. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=153.72s)]
*  That's the first thing I've ever heard. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=154.12s)]
*  Stephen A, they started first take today. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=156.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=159.16s)]
*  Two minute intro from the show credits of Molly and went to Stephen A. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=159.36s)]
*  17 straight minutes and it was incredible, compelling TV. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=163.48s)]
*  He's an artist. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=166.96s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=167.52s)]
*  I was really into it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=169.2s)]
*  I really enjoyed it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  He's really good. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=170.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=171.83999999999997s)]
*  Uh, I don't know where this goes, but I'll tell you this. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=172.28s)]
*  If you're, if you're going to do the, who has more to lose sweepstakes, I'm [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=174.88s)]
*  going to say LeBron has more to lose. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  If this just gets worse and worse and worse. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=179.92s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=181.79999999999998s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=182.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=183.92s)]
*  Well, I'm not saying he has more to lose. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=184.6s)]
*  I'm saying he's just more famous. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=186.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=188.64s)]
*  Stephen A like this is great. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=188.88s)]
*  I'll keep this going as long as you want. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=190.56s)]
*  I don't know that LeBron's more. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=192.95999999999998s)]
*  Stephen A could be our next president. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=194.32s)]
*  I don't know who's more famous. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=195.72s)]
*  Maybe that's how Stephen A wins. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  He becomes the next president and he abolishes the NBA max contract. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=198.84s)]
*  That'll be his first thing. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=203.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=204.76s)]
*  NFL regular season win totals. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=206.12s)]
*  So we're going to go by where you want to go alphabetically or you [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=208.6s)]
*  want to go by divisions? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=212.24s)]
*  How do you want to do it? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=213.68s)]
*  Probably divisions. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=214.56s)]
*  I mean, I really like to do 15 minutes on Jokic's no look pass and another [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  20 on whether Steph's, uh, tunnel shot went in, but okay, if you want to get [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=220.0s)]
*  right into it, it's fine. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=223.88s)]
*  The tunnel shot. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=225.6s)]
*  Is that Steph's fault that it was Senate? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=227.04s)]
*  Like should he have retweeted the angle and said that didn't actually go in? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=229.0s)]
*  He needs to apologize. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=233.04s)]
*  I was saying that he's no longer a first ballot hall of famer. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=234.28s)]
*  I mean, he now drops the two or three, but I thought the, my, my favorite thing [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=237.08s)]
*  about it is typical NBA fashion. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=241.44s)]
*  It took three days to review. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=243.72s)]
*  Like, why didn't we get that second angle an hour later? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=245.52s)]
*  I found out like on Thursday, the monitor. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=249.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=251.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=252.0s)]
*  Division. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=252.8s)]
*  Yeah, let's do divisions. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=253.2s)]
*  We'll start with the AFCs. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=254.32s)]
*  Buffalo bills. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=255.56s)]
*  They went 13 and four. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=257.8s)]
*  We're going to tell you the only things that we know that we did work on were what [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=258.92s)]
*  other two divisions each team is playing. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=263.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=265.6s)]
*  So the Buffalo bills were 13 and four last year. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=266.04s)]
*  Next year they're playing the AFC North. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=268.92s)]
*  Not awesome. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=271.16s)]
*  NFC South pretty good. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=272.8s)]
*  So I'm going to say that's, it's about an average degree though. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=274.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's a wash. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=277.92s)]
*  I think that's fair. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=279.12s)]
*  Lem. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=280.2s)]
*  We should also say like, you know, we may have like some liens here, but these [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  aren't our official picks. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=284.16s)]
*  You don't want to tarnish her. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=285.6s)]
*  What were you 27 and five last year? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=287.04s)]
*  Yeah, I'm never I'm going to go five and 27 next year. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=288.88s)]
*  I'll never pass 27 and five. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=291.32s)]
*  No, we're still missing like two key components. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=293.08s)]
*  We haven't seen the draft obviously, and we don't know the schedule. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=295.68s)]
*  We know who everybody plays. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=298.4s)]
*  We don't know like rest advantage. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=299.8s)]
*  We don't know like, you know, who has three road games in a row and stuff like [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=301.12s)]
*  that. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=304.68s)]
*  Those are crucial. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=304.88s)]
*  We know we don't know what's happening in the draft. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=305.6s)]
*  None of this stuff. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=308.08s)]
*  Just like, yeah. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  And we're trying to guess, what do we think Fandual thought would be the perfect [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=309.8s)]
*  over under? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=315.36s)]
*  Because the goal of this when they're putting out these overrunners in March, how [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=315.92s)]
*  do we get the most action both ways on the over there? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=319.16s)]
*  Last year, Dallas, they put it a wind too high. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=321.92s)]
*  Everybody bet. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, this I'm sorry, it was your team, but everybody bet the under everybody kept [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=326.04s)]
*  that in the end there and they had to move it from 10 and a half to nine and a [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=330.08s)]
*  half, which was a really bad sign. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=332.48s)]
*  So one of the things we're interested this year is snapshot of in March when this [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=334.08s)]
*  comes out and then how does it shift? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=337.72s)]
*  They'll start putting action. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=339.84000000000003s)]
*  If people are banging the over, like if people start banging the Patriots over, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=341.40000000000003s)]
*  they'll make it a minus one 40 minus one 45. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=344.96s)]
*  So you'll get a sense of like, oh, who is America really starting to get behind? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=347.48s)]
*  Which can either be a good thing or bad thing. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=351.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=353.92s)]
*  So Buffalo, I went with 11.5. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=354.16s)]
*  So 11 and a half wins as the over under. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=357.4s)]
*  What'd you have? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=361.28000000000003s)]
*  I said 12. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=362.24s)]
*  And again, I'm looking at these for the first time. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=364.12s)]
*  You can't say you have to do a 0.5, right? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=367.12s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=369.6s)]
*  Half of them were regular square numbers. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=370.52s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=374.24s)]
*  Oh, I didn't even know we were doing that. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=374.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=376.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=376.8s)]
*  I wrote down the last year. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=377.04s)]
*  So they were like, uh, you were right though. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=378.08s)]
*  Of course. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=379.92s)]
*  So the, the cheating, uh, right off the top worked out 11 and a half. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=380.36s)]
*  I knew this would be a new way for you to get bad people. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=385.36s)]
*  You wouldn't guess the lines last year. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=387.88s)]
*  And there's been a lot of talk about you and whether you've been cheating. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=389.48s)]
*  This doesn't count. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=391.84s)]
*  This doesn't count. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=392.88s)]
*  Like, are you using PDs? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=393.88s)]
*  What's going on over there? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=396.08s)]
*  Uh, so they went, they had 13 wins last year and it's 11 and a half. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=397.64s)]
*  Yep. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=402.59999999999997s)]
*  And that's to say that the division got better or you just can't make them 12. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=403.0s)]
*  Well, we should also mention this is crucial to minus one 40 already for the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  over, at least I'm in Boston so I can bet it and I could do a live bet as we're [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=413.08s)]
*  talking, but, um, minus one 40 already, which makes me wonder, do they bump that [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=417.28s)]
*  at some point, but I think. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=421.28s)]
*  Miami's probably a little either the same or a little worse than last year jets. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=423.40000000000003s)]
*  I, who knows the paths are the only one that you could say they'll definitely be [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=428.08000000000004s)]
*  better. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=431.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=432.12s)]
*  So, and we, as far as we can tell Buffalo didn't get worse. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=432.36s)]
*  So I think they're fine. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=436.16s)]
*  I think that was, you know, you know, what they have out of BOSA is good. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=437.40000000000003s)]
*  They just need, you know, basically they're going to get the seven BOSA [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=441.40000000000003s)]
*  games. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=444.88000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=445.56s)]
*  I mean, he looks awesome. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=446.08000000000004s)]
*  That's good. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=447.6s)]
*  I mean, he's definitely going to miss time, but they extended, uh, Alan, which [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=448.16s)]
*  is, which is great. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=451.32000000000005s)]
*  I mean, we don't 11 and a half 12 is fine. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=452.24s)]
*  So you get it. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=454.40000000000003s)]
*  Oh, I forgot to mention one variable that you have to factor in is the schedule. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=455.68s)]
*  So we're doing this by how they finished last year. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=459.40000000000003s)]
*  So AFC is Buffalo's first place scheduled next year. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=461.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=464.28000000000003s)]
*  They'll have a bunch of night games. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=464.56s)]
*  So all that stuff, Miami eight, nine last year, AFC North, NFC South, second [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=466.32s)]
*  place schedule and, uh, whatever this is, I might make a live under bet right now. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=471.44s)]
*  Um, what do you have for this one? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=479.32s)]
*  I have nine. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=481.12s)]
*  Nine. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=483.04s)]
*  Why you really went round numbers. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=483.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=486.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=487.24s)]
*  How about half of mine? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=487.48s)]
*  Uh, no, I got more, more, uh, haps, but yeah, I might be one. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=488.48s)]
*  I might be low last year. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=494.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=496.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=496.56s)]
*  They're eight and nine. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=497.2s)]
*  I might be low. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=497.92s)]
*  I said seven and a half. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=498.6s)]
*  I don't like the vibe of that dolphins team at all. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=499.76s)]
*  And the answer is eight and a half, eight and a half. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=502.16s)]
*  So I get it. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=505.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm going under. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=506.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=507.32s)]
*  That's a guaranteed under for me. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=507.56s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=509.72s)]
*  Well, that eight last year, JJ talking about this or should I do it? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=510.96s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=515.28s)]
*  You do it. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=515.56s)]
*  You got it. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=516.0799999999999s)]
*  You start. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=516.4399999999999s)]
*  I'll jump in. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=517.0s)]
*  I don't know, bro. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=517.84s)]
*  Eight and a half slow. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=518.6s)]
*  So must, must win season for McDaniel. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=519.64s)]
*  It's a must win. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=522.68s)]
*  It's got to win 10 games. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=523.88s)]
*  There's that keeping his job, bro. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=524.88s)]
*  You're going to tell me Zach Wilson is going to step in there and do the job. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=526.72s)]
*  I'm not buying it. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=531.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm not buying it for sure. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=532.04s)]
*  He goes under. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=533.04s)]
*  That's a discussion for a different day. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=534.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=536.1999999999999s)]
*  Uh, all right. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=537.1999999999999s)]
*  Eight and a half, even money both ways. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=537.88s)]
*  So I, my prediction is that's going to be an under bet for a lot of people. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=539.96s)]
*  All right. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=544.0s)]
*  Jets are next. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=544.2800000000001s)]
*  They were five and 12 third place scheduled next year. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=544.9200000000001s)]
*  Justin Fields, now a quarterback, seventh pick in the draft. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=548.88s)]
*  We'll see what they do with that. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=552.24s)]
*  The one thing that could affect this is if they take Shadr Sanders with the [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=554.2s)]
*  seventh pick and basically get nothing out of that first round pick, because [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=558.32s)]
*  they already took, uh, fields. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=562.12s)]
*  So I'm going to say six and a half for these guys. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=565.08s)]
*  What do you have? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=569.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=570.48s)]
*  I get this. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=570.68s)]
*  I said six and did you see it? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=571.3199999999999s)]
*  Uh, it is five and a half. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=574.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=576.76s)]
*  Wow. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=577.24s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=578.4399999999999s)]
*  It was nine and a half with Rogers. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=579.08s)]
*  It's five and a half with Justin Fields. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=581.36s)]
*  That's a, they went way too high on Rogers, which we know, but five and a half. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=584.12s)]
*  What a slap in the effing Empire's state building phase. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=589.64s)]
*  I think that's too low. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=593.88s)]
*  Don't you? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=595.48s)]
*  New coach, Aaron Glenn. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=596.52s)]
*  Fields different look than, than, uh, Rogers, but not necessarily a worst look. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=598.68s)]
*  Seventh pick in the draft. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=606.7199999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=609.52s)]
*  I haven't seen like, all right. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=610.28s)]
*  So how many games will they be favored in? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=611.5999999999999s)]
*  One in their division, but maybe the home pads game, the home dolphins game. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=614.64s)]
*  Maybe none of the AFC North games. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=619.4399999999999s)]
*  Probably no couple of the NFC South Carolina. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=621.68s)]
*  If it's home against Carolina. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=625.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=627.12s)]
*  I think that's about it. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=627.8399999999999s)]
*  It's home against New Orleans. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=628.3599999999999s)]
*  Huh? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=630.7199999999999s)]
*  What a mess. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=631.16s)]
*  And then maybe one other shit team. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=631.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=633.0799999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=633.9599999999999s)]
*  This is the most exciting one. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=634.24s)]
*  The Patriots four and 13 new coach just spent money all over the place on a [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=635.4s)]
*  bunch of different positions that the fourth pick in the draft seems like about [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=640.04s)]
*  a 50, 50 chance of getting a dual Carter or Travis Hunter Drake may year two. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=643.88s)]
*  To say the coaching staff will be better as an understatement and they're going [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=649.28s)]
*  to have a fourth place schedule and they get to play the NFC South. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=653.04s)]
*  There's a lot of things lining up for them to be the watch. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=656.6s)]
*  This could be 10 and a half and you're going over. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=659.3199999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=662.48s)]
*  And half I'd be insulted. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=662.84s)]
*  I think it should be 12 and a half. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=663.96s)]
*  What do you have? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=665.92s)]
*  I have seven and a half. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=667.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I had too. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=668.92s)]
*  And the answer is seven and a half. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=670.08s)]
*  All right. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=673.12s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=674.1999999999999s)]
*  That's fair. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=674.88s)]
*  My, that's what you want to be 15 already. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=675.28s)]
*  All right. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=678.12s)]
*  So we're two Europe, two one one with me right now. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=678.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=681.64s)]
*  Does that go up? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=684.3199999999999s)]
*  What if they get Abdul Carter or Chonter in the draft? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=686.64s)]
*  Does that go up? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=689.08s)]
*  Well, you're very influential and I know you're, I'm not influential with this. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=690.12s)]
*  You're over the moon about Stefan digs. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=695.8s)]
*  You got your way there. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=697.8s)]
*  Not that one. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=698.68s)]
*  I'm not, I'm, I'm, uh, I'll work by the end of April. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=699.68s)]
*  I'll be over the moon on the Dick signing right now. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=703.68s)]
*  I'm, I'm kind of still confused. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=705.84s)]
*  Although it does seem like they can get out of it after a year, but the 32 year old [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=708.3199999999999s)]
*  receiver coming off ACL surgery, I don't know. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=711.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=715.12s)]
*  You're not going to be in a spot where you're going to want to lose that last game, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=715.52s)]
*  right? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=718.6s)]
*  Which is where you were, which when we typically go over some of these teams over [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=718.88s)]
*  unders, you have to factor that in. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=722.3199999999999s)]
*  And now I think, I think you could be an eight and nine team. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=725.3199999999999s)]
*  You should be happy with eight and nine and Drake may second year. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=728.4s)]
*  Well, the question is, could you be better than that? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=731.28s)]
*  And that's what we said with Washington last year where they checked every box and [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=733.36s)]
*  both of us were, we both jumped on the over, but we kind of drew the line. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=736.7199999999999s)]
*  And could they be a playoff team? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=742.04s)]
*  You need to watch the Denver type situation, right? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=744.1999999999999s)]
*  I think your situation is even closer to Denver, even though it's, I know [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=747.8399999999999s)]
*  Nick was a rookie coming in, but older, whatever. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=750.88s)]
*  Uh, yeah, I think that's kind of what you have to do. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=753.76s)]
*  Sneak up there. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=756.16s)]
*  It's the recipe that works every year. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=757.6s)]
*  And the question is whether it's the Patriots or another crappy [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=759.7199999999999s)]
*  team making the jump. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=762.36s)]
*  It's did you improve your coach? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=763.52s)]
*  Do you have a QB? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=765.92s)]
*  Is your schedule easy? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=767.52s)]
*  If you have those three things, it becomes very realistic to go from four to 10 [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=769.28s)]
*  wins. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=773.3199999999999s)]
*  We see it all the time and I think they're a great candidate for this. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=773.68s)]
*  So we already sold, you already sold the nine part documentary for the [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=776.8s)]
*  2025 Patriots. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=781.5999999999999s)]
*  So, I mean, good job by you, I guess. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=783.0s)]
*  Did they, did they greenlight that yet? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=785.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=787.4799999999999s)]
*  It's just about Drake may it's not about the Patriots. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=788.3199999999999s)]
*  It's it's, we're just with, it's like Truman show. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=790.56s)]
*  Remember that movie Truman show? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=793.1999999999999s)]
*  It's that or Drake may we just, uh, we follow them around. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=794.4799999999999s)]
*  Um, all right, we're going to take a quick break and then we're going to do [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=798.5999999999999s)]

*  All right, come back. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=867.52s)]
*  We're into the AFC North. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=868.0799999999999s)]
*  There's a world where this is the best division next year, depending on what [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=871.2399999999999s)]
*  happens with Cleveland. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=875.56s)]
*  Like if they took Sanders at second and he was good right away with the rest of [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=877.04s)]
*  the team they have, maybe, I don't know. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=881.1999999999999s)]
*  Let's try to remember to add up, add up the over under wins to determine who is [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=883.08s)]
*  the best division. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=887.48s)]
*  So yeah, we'll, we'll see. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=888.28s)]
*  This should, this could have the most Baltimore. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=889.5600000000001s)]
*  So the AFC North is playing the AFC East and the NFC North pretty tough, pretty [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=894.2s)]
*  tough. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=900.08s)]
*  So for easy games, if the Bears are even mediocre to decent, there's no easy games [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=900.6800000000001s)]
*  in the NFC North. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=906.72s)]
*  And then in the AFC East, maybe the Jets, maybe the Dolphins, maybe the Pats, but [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=907.88s)]
*  maybe two of those three teams are like pretty frisky. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=912.04s)]
*  So that's a pretty tough one. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=915.0s)]
*  Baltimore first place schedule. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=916.52s)]
*  They're going to have Sunday night games, Monday night games. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=918.56s)]
*  They're in the running for a Christmas game, a Thursday game. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=920.8399999999999s)]
*  You know, they're going to have another monster schedule because they want to [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=925.52s)]
*  put Lamar on TV. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=928.1999999999999s)]
*  I predicted 11 and a half for this. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=930.28s)]
*  That's exactly what I said. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=933.0s)]
*  Where are we? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=934.8399999999999s)]
*  The answer is 11 and a half. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=936.28s)]
*  There's 11 and a half. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=940.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=940.9599999999999s)]
*  We got it. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=941.1999999999999s)]
*  We split it in one time too. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=941.52s)]
*  They're really, that's one of those that the schedule stuff was a little easier. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=943.04s)]
*  I would have gone 12 and a half, but I think you almost have to do the docket by [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=947.04s)]
*  one game just because you know, it's probably headed for them. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=951.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=953.72s)]
*  They were 11 last year and they won 12 games. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=954.4399999999999s)]
*  So it kind of, that's a nice settling spot for them. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=957.72s)]
*  Last year, Pittsburgh 10 and seven second place schedule. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=961.6s)]
*  We talked about the AFC, NFC North. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=966.76s)]
*  And as far as we know, they don't have a quarterback yet. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=968.84s)]
*  Now they're running out of possibilities because the giant signed to the guys. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=971.52s)]
*  Rogers is still lurking and just seems like he's milking it. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=975.76s)]
*  There's Jackson dart possibilities, I guess. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=979.72s)]
*  Maybe they wanted to try to bow nix that situation. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=982.48s)]
*  Um, not a lot of other options after that, unless they want to play the [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=986.04s)]
*  Mason Rudolph card and yet this is a team every year that goes over there over. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=989.72s)]
*  Do you think they factored that in with the silver under pick or not? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=995.8s)]
*  You know, what's weird with it? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=998.92s)]
*  They didn't. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1000.16s)]
*  So yesterday Russ signs with the Giants and Fandels like, all right. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1000.8000000000001s)]
*  So Rogers is the only missing piece at this point. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1005.08s)]
*  And probably to the Steelers. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1008.32s)]
*  We don't give a shit. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1010.0400000000001s)]
*  We can't wait. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1010.96s)]
*  We can't wait. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1012.0400000000001s)]
*  We're not going to move it a tick. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1013.24s)]
*  If he signs with Pittsburgh or not. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1015.1600000000001s)]
*  Uh, I don't, I mean, what do they have? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1017.8000000000001s)]
*  They have Rudolph and they have a Skyler Thompson. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1019.4s)]
*  They should go for it. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1022.12s)]
*  Go for it with those two. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1023.24s)]
*  That'll be fun. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1024.6000000000001s)]
*  Or trade for, or trade for not Kenny Pickett, but somebody of [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1025.72s)]
*  that ilk give up, I guess, six round pick. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1030.64s)]
*  It's pretty brutal. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1033.48s)]
*  I can't believe they didn't figure this out. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1034.44s)]
*  So I guess they ate in a half. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1036.0s)]
*  That's what it was last year. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1038.0s)]
*  Sounds great. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1039.1200000000001s)]
*  What'd you have? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1039.76s)]
*  I said seven and a half. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1040.6000000000001s)]
*  Oh, like this team. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1041.88s)]
*  What is it? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1043.72s)]
*  Uh, you're right. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1044.0s)]
*  Seven and a half. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1044.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1045.8000000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1046.64s)]
*  You're doing better than me. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1046.96s)]
*  You're up. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1048.76s)]
*  You're plus two on me right now. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1049.0800000000002s)]
*  And, uh, there's been, there's been some juice already. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1050.8000000000002s)]
*  That is minus one 20 as we're taping this. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1054.88s)]
*  It is one 51 Pacific East time juice on the over. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1057.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1060.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1061.0400000000002s)]
*  Because Mike Tomlin wins nine or 10 games every single year. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1062.16s)]
*  And that's just what he does. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1065.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1067.0800000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1067.8000000000002s)]
*  This is a tough schedule. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1068.48s)]
*  I think, uh, I think everybody knows how to beat the Steelers now. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1070.16s)]
*  You need 17 points. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1073.88s)]
*  Go get it. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1075.2800000000002s)]
*  Maybe even 16. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1077.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1078.8000000000002s)]
*  Roger's going to the Steelers is probably the most fun outcome from a content [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1080.5200000000002s)]
*  standpoint and there's a chance that they were fans will just hate his guts by [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1083.92s)]
*  November. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1088.72s)]
*  Um, but we'll see how it goes. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1089.6s)]
*  Cincinnati. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1091.4s)]
*  I had the hardest time with this one. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1093.0s)]
*  I think of anyone in the AFC. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1094.56s)]
*  They're playing the AFC East NFC North third place schedule. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1096.64s)]
*  They re-signed their receivers. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1101.16s)]
*  They have burrow. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1103.4s)]
*  We'll see what happens with Hendrickson. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1104.4s)]
*  Middle of the first round pick. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1107.2s)]
*  I couldn't get to the 10 range with them. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1109.4s)]
*  I went nine and a half. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1111.56s)]
*  What'd you do? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1112.52s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1112.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1113.84s)]
*  I went 10 and a half. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1114.1200000000001s)]
*  I think they juice this up because any fantasy player is not really paying [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1115.32s)]
*  attention to how bad their offensive line might be. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1119.08s)]
*  Wants to bet the over and the Bengals and it was 10 and a half last year. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1122.16s)]
*  What is it? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1125.72s)]
*  It is 10 and a half. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1127.28s)]
*  You're killing me. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1128.64s)]
*  What the hell? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1129.84s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1130.76s)]
*  This is your new favorite game. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1131.64s)]
*  This is it. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1133.04s)]
*  This counts as four, four weeks. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1133.8s)]
*  Um, one thing with this one though, there's already a lot of juice on the under. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1136.72s)]
*  It's minus one 30, the most, the under 10 and a half. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1142.68s)]
*  So I might be right in two months. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1144.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1147.4399999999998s)]
*  I don't, I don't see 11 wins for this team. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1147.6399999999999s)]
*  That's a lot that 11 wins makes them one of the four best teams in the [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1151.52s)]
*  AFC and you would take Buffalo over them. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1155.1599999999999s)]
*  You take Casey over them. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1157.3999999999999s)]
*  You would definitely take Baltimore over them. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1159.4399999999998s)]
*  And then, then it comes down to, would you take, take like, are they in the [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1162.12s)]
*  Texans chargers kind of class or higher than that? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1165.8s)]
*  Cause this, this, that over under says they're higher than that. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1170.6799999999998s)]
*  I'm with you. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1174.0s)]
*  I'm as right about the Bengals as I am as wrong about the Browns. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1174.56s)]
*  And I feel like betting them to win 11. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1178.28s)]
*  So it's going to be a tough schedule. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1180.76s)]
*  They always get off to a slow start. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1182.08s)]
*  I said there were a lot, they lost Alex Kaepern and Trent Brown. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1184.2s)]
*  So it could be one of those years where Burrows running for his life. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1186.6799999999998s)]
*  So I don't love them with 11 wins. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1189.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1192.56s)]
*  And we still don't know what's happening. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1192.72s)]
*  Hendrickson, Cleveland three and 14 last year, fourth place schedule and no cap [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1193.6399999999999s)]
*  space whatsoever. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1201.8s)]
*  Kenny Pickett maybe is the quarterback unless they take Sanders. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1204.8s)]
*  I love what you said. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1208.6799999999998s)]
*  What'd you say? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1209.3999999999999s)]
*  That is the funniest trade ever. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1209.72s)]
*  Who's it? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1211.96s)]
*  Oh, it's pick it somehow. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1212.3999999999999s)]
*  Philly got like a six round pick out of it to trade pick it, turn pick it into [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1214.04s)]
*  Dorian Thompson Robinson. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1218.3999999999999s)]
*  And we need like a six rounder. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1219.56s)]
*  That's gotta be it. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1223.76s)]
*  I, uh, I went low. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1225.48s)]
*  I went five and a half. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1227.76s)]
*  You know, I said five and a half too. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1229.48s)]
*  I'm regretting this. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1230.9199999999998s)]
*  I think it could be even lower. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1231.76s)]
*  They're miserable. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1233.6799999999998s)]
*  Nailed it five and a half. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1234.2s)]
*  Is it? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1235.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1235.68s)]
*  Yep. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1236.1200000000001s)]
*  So juice on that one too already minus one 25. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1237.04s)]
*  So people are banging the over. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1240.96s)]
*  If you're banging the over, there's a case for it. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1242.76s)]
*  You have to think they're taking Sanders and that he's going to be good right away. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1245.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1249.3600000000001s)]
*  He's bowed next next year for them. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1249.68s)]
*  And, uh, I don't know, I guess that's the case. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1252.16s)]
*  This is a weird year with the quarterbacks. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1255.32s)]
*  It really is. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1257.24s)]
*  There might be actually too many quarterbacks versus teams that are going to [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1257.72s)]
*  take quarterbacks in the first round. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1261.0s)]
*  I know I'll be wrong because everybody takes quarterbacks early, but are, are [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1262.8s)]
*  the Browns and Titans definitely taking a quarterback or the giants like [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1267.24s)]
*  Titans are, I think Titans, I think cam ward is pretty locked into that one. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1272.3999999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1276.84s)]
*  McShea McShea had some intel in his newsletter day that he thought there [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1277.84s)]
*  was a possibility of the giants were trying to trade up to one and basically [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1281.68s)]
*  got the word that Titans were taking ward. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1286.08s)]
*  Everyone seems to think he's going first. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1287.96s)]
*  Odds reflect it right now. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1290.44s)]
*  I don't think the minus 1200 on Fandel to be the first pick. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1292.36s)]
*  I thought I'd go for some of those. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1295.6799999999998s)]
*  I put money on dart and Sanders just thinking like, maybe someone does [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1297.32s)]
*  something really stupid here, but because I don't feel like we've heard a lot [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1301.9599999999998s)]
*  about why no awards getting a little bit buzzed, but not to warrant minus 1200. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1305.6799999999998s)]
*  I told our guy Jack at Fandel. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1310.28s)]
*  I said, I wanted them to have the Bill Simmons runs around his house with his [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1312.84s)]
*  arms up in the air, screaming euphorically, one, two, three, four draft [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1317.28s)]
*  scenario that I want to be able to bet. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1322.04s)]
*  Oh, what goes first? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1324.56s)]
*  Cleveland takes Sanders second giants take Travis Hunter third. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1327.24s)]
*  And then we get Abdul Carter fourth in that I'm running around my house like this. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1331.64s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1335.84s)]
*  I want to be able. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1336.32s)]
*  And by the way, we should be able to bet that they don't have the [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1337.28s)]
*  exact order of draft things yet. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1339.2s)]
*  Cause I think it's too far away. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1340.84s)]
*  They usually do it two weeks before the draft. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1341.96s)]
*  I want it now. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1344.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1345.32s)]
*  We're within a month. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1345.68s)]
*  Like fucking put it up. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1346.52s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1347.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1348.28s)]
*  Bill Simmons. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1349.1200000000001s)]
*  I want to bet all kinds of scenarios. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1349.72s)]
*  Bangs his shoulder on the fridge, separates it much like Abdul Carter. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1351.32s)]
*  Go. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1355.08s)]
*  Come on. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1355.8s)]
*  That was fine. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1356.9199999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1358.96s)]
*  AFC South. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1359.28s)]
*  Now they're playing the AFC West and the NFC West this year. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1362.08s)]
*  What are your thoughts on that? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1365.3999999999999s)]
*  Uh, I think that's a, that's fine. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1366.48s)]
*  I think that's fine. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1370.3999999999999s)]
*  They play themselves. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1371.6s)]
*  So that's what's, that's what's good. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1372.8799999999999s)]
*  That was a tepid endorsement. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1376.24s)]
*  Well, you know what I'm also looking at? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1378.1599999999999s)]
*  So third, so let's add that up. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1380.0s)]
*  33 wins for the AFC East and, uh, 35 for the AFC North. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1381.56s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1390.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1390.68s)]
*  Well, that number is about to drop for the, uh, so Houston 10 and seven last year. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1391.4s)]
*  And then they're playing the West and the West. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1397.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1400.24s)]
*  I think you could argue they're worse. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1401.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1403.84s)]
*  I don't know when tank that was coming back. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1404.6s)]
*  Digs is gone. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1406.84s)]
*  He was gone anyway. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1407.8s)]
*  They traded tonsil. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1409.32s)]
*  They got a second round pick for him. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1410.16s)]
*  The AFC South I'm assuming will be a whiff better than it was last year. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1412.52s)]
*  And they're playing a first place schedule. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1417.88s)]
*  I wanted to go 10 and a half and I couldn't get there. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1419.32s)]
*  I went nine and a half. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1421.92s)]
*  What'd you do? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1422.84s)]
*  That's what I have. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1423.16s)]
*  There's a nine and a half. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1424.4s)]
*  It can't be 10. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1425.24s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1427.04s)]
*  I, I did think about the round 10. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1427.68s)]
*  Yep. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1429.72s)]
*  Nine and a half. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1430.0s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1430.96s)]
*  Breaking. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1432.72s)]
*  Got it right. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1433.12s)]
*  Well, not only do we get it right. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1434.48s)]
*  Minus one 60 on the under. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1436.92s)]
*  So that's the biggest. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1439.56s)]
*  So the most action we've seen so far as the, uh, is that minus 160 Vegas [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1441.12s)]
*  doesn't like Houston, they're a weird team, right? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1447.2s)]
*  Fire their offensive coordinator. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1451.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1453.16s)]
*  They should mow through this division and they were in how confident were [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1454.12s)]
*  we in CJ Stroud last year, and then we didn't get that confidence back until [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1457.44s)]
*  like the first round of the playoffs. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1461.08s)]
*  So it's strange that they signed a lot of one year players, Cam Robinson, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1462.4s)]
*  Denell Hunter, Trent Brown. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1465.96s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1467.76s)]
*  Indianapolis eight and nine last year, second place schedule. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1470.0s)]
*  Um, our guide, the bundle is a little higher on the Anthony Richardson. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1475.16s)]
*  Don't count this guy out. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1478.72s)]
*  He was banged up last year. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1479.8s)]
*  This is going to be the FU come back year for Richardson. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1481.56s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1485.12s)]
*  Uh, if that doesn't happen, Daniel dimes is right behind him. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1485.96s)]
*  Would you go? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1490.04s)]
*  I want to have a strong opinion about Jones. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1490.48s)]
*  I, I, I'm not there yet, but I feel like I have no reason to support them, but [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1492.68s)]
*  maybe that was a, as disastrous a situation as you could come from going to [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1497.8s)]
*  giants, tornades, CL giants. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1503.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1505.04s)]
*  And I'll come into the Colts. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1505.68s)]
*  Maybe, maybe that's a good deal. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1506.8s)]
*  Oh, sounds like you like it. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1509.08s)]
*  I have seven and a half. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1510.44s)]
*  What'd you have? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1511.24s)]
*  Uh, we're on, we're on bar here. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1512.44s)]
*  Seven and a half for me too. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1514.28s)]
*  And it's seven and a half and minus one 10 both ways. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1516.2s)]
*  Not a lot of Colts actually. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1518.92s)]
*  These are all right. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1519.92s)]
*  So you're still up plus two on me, but we've nailed the last couple. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1521.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1524.6000000000001s)]
*  This one was a hard one. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1525.0s)]
*  Jacksonville third place schedule West and West four and 13 last year. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1525.96s)]
*  You know, I, I don't know what this team does. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1532.96s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1535.6000000000001s)]
*  You're like, they wave Christian Kirk and then just signed another receiver for the [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1537.32s)]
*  money and now they're paying two, two fine receivers, a double salary, basically. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1542.2s)]
*  Uh, excited about the army Brown. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1548.44s)]
*  Yeah, not a fifth pick in the draft. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1550.44s)]
*  Could be Gentie could be Tyler Warren. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1556.6000000000001s)]
*  Everybody likes him as like an awesome tight end. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1559.92s)]
*  They just keep throwing resources at the receiver position and never happens. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1562.32s)]
*  But, uh, I was, I was between five and a half and six and a half for this. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1565.68s)]
*  New coach was the big thing for me. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1571.52s)]
*  And I went six and a half. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1574.24s)]
*  What'd you have? [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1575.3600000000001s)]
*  Did I go too high with seven and a half? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1576.1200000000001s)]
*  I just feel like all these teams are the same. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1578.32s)]
*  You did not go too high. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1580.48s)]
*  Seven and a half. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1581.92s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1582.8400000000001s)]
*  So you could quit now. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1583.88s)]
*  You want to cash out, hit the cash out button. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1585.52s)]
*  Is there a bet back? [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1587.76s)]
*  What's that bet back thing? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1588.76s)]
*  Findle has, um, not only is it seven and a half minus one 30. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1589.76s)]
*  So action on the Jaguars. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1594.1599999999999s)]

*  Tennessee three and 14 last year, Weston West fourth place schedule. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1671.76s)]

*  If it's much better than it was last year. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1684.04s)]
*  I, I, I was trying to think, is this, is this the safest bet to be the worst [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1687.44s)]
*  team in the league in the AFC next year? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1691.88s)]

*  No. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1697.4s)]
*  And I don't know why I put this at five and a half. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1697.8400000000001s)]
*  I think I regret that because they, they could make it nice and easy and well, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1700.4s)]
*  I don't, I don't want to sway you, but did you go low? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1704.76s)]
*  No, I had so initially I penciled in five and a half. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1706.76s)]
*  And then after I did all the divisions for the AFC and I was like, man, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1710.88s)]
*  who's the worst team? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1715.8400000000001s)]
*  Like there's gonna, we see this every year. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1717.0s)]
*  There's a four and a half, there's a three and a half, and there's none of [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1718.8400000000001s)]

*  And I, so I ended up with a four and a half. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1723.48s)]
*  So we will see the answer is five and a half. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1726.3600000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1729.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1729.88s)]

*  She's my jam. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1733.2s)]
*  Let's just keep doing this every week. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1734.3600000000001s)]
*  Not only is it five and a half, it's up to minus one 30. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1736.68s)]
*  I wouldn't go over on that at all. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1740.16s)]
*  So if you're doing that, you're expecting cam ward to get drafted [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1742.1200000000001s)]
*  and be good right away. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1745.0400000000002s)]

*  No, I'm still having nightmares of that game one bet against Caleb Williams, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1754.24s)]
*  who was supposed to be the rookie. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1758.68s)]
*  I bet we'll love us. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1759.8s)]
*  They had a giant lead on the bears and then we'll love us. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1761.1200000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1765.8s)]
*  Staring at pick six is it's just, it's just my favorite with that with you is [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1767.0800000000002s)]
*  when you then get mad at will love us. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1771.16s)]
*  Like this was his fault. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1773.0800000000002s)]
*  Like you bet on him. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1774.16s)]

*  It's like, you can't no size at all. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1778.1200000000001s)]
*  He might shoot the day. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1780.72s)]
*  He threw the game. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1782.24s)]
*  If we were to write down three games that players through quote, whatever, I [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1782.88s)]
*  now fan or when I get in trouble, that's felt like what it would have looked like [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1787.56s)]
*  if somebody actually, yeah, I see. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1791.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1793.6399999999999s)]
*  If you had made a, make a movie about it, that's what it would look like. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1793.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, here's the thing. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1797.12s)]
*  We only had the jets at five and a half Cleveland at five and a half in Tennessee [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1798.48s)]
*  at five and a half so far, we have no four and a half. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1803.04s)]
*  So one of those three will be at four and a half by like June or July, because [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1806.28s)]
*  that's just how this goes. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1809.52s)]
*  That's right. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1810.76s)]
*  That's fair. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1811.32s)]
*  So just to recap East 33 wins, North 35, South 30. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1811.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1819.84s)]
*  Going to the AFC West, which might be good for all we know. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1822.04s)]
*  Kansas city 15 and two last year playing the AFC South in the NFC East. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1830.9199999999998s)]
*  So you're talking giants are going to suck. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1838.08s)]
*  Three of those AFC South teams might suck. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1842.3999999999999s)]
*  Houston might not be very good. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1845.1599999999999s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1847.0s)]
*  Your Dallas team might not be very good and Washington and Philly would be the [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1847.3999999999999s)]
*  two hard games out of those eight, but they'll have the first place schedule. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1850.48s)]
*  They're going to be in all the night games, but that's about as good of a, is [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1854.6s)]
*  there a better division draw than AFC South NFC East, maybe West NFC West AFC South? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1858.04s)]
*  That's pretty good. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1863.36s)]
*  I think those would be two to three out of one. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1863.96s)]
*  That's pretty good. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1865.84s)]
*  I think one of the teams has both Souths. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1866.3999999999999s)]
*  I think that's in the NFC, but we'll one of the divisions. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1869.6s)]
*  So I went, uh, I went 12 and a half for this. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1873.52s)]
*  That's what I did. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1877.04s)]
*  And I wonder if it's even light. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1878.28s)]
*  Tell me what it is. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1880.08s)]

*  All right. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=1917.96s)]

*  Minus one Oh five. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2093.56s)]
*  So just a whiff of action on that one toward the under. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2094.56s)]
*  And then last but not least, this one's a hard one. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2098.88s)]
*  The Las Vegas Raiders get Gino Smith and they got rid of our guy, Antonio Pierce. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2102.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2109.12s)]

*  head gig, just be, be my guess. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2115.16s)]

*  Right. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2121.16s)]
*  A lot of gum chewing Max Crosby gets extended fourth place schedule. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2122.6s)]
*  Plus AFC South plus NFC East. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2130.48s)]
*  And by your theory, you think at least in the home games, they might [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2132.88s)]
*  be favored like five times. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2136.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2138.36s)]

*  They were six and a half last year. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2143.3199999999997s)]
*  I think they may perceive this Gino Smith thing as an upgrade, even though they [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2144.7999999999997s)]
*  didn't have, they only have four ones. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2149.08s)]
*  I said six and a half. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2150.4s)]
*  And you nailed it exactly. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2152.0s)]

*  I should have seen that one. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2158.4s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2159.64s)]
*  You're killing me. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2160.56s)]

*  So this is the, I'm firing all my scouts and my, all my helpers. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2163.76s)]
*  And I, I've got to read. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2167.44s)]

*  Maybe I'm not off. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2173.04s)]
*  Maybe we'll look back in December and be like, oh, Simmons is first instinct. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2174.08s)]
*  Maybe we should have. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2178.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, that's what you should do. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2179.48s)]
*  You should, you should mark your biggest differences and say, that's going to be. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2180.32s)]
*  So 36 wins for that division. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2184.16s)]
*  That's the tops. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2186.08s)]
*  That's more than the AFC North projected 36 for the West. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2187.48s)]
*  And by the way, God bless Pete Carroll, but he's in his mid seventies. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2192.2s)]
*  Gino Smith, 34 years old. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2197.0s)]
*  I'm not sure if they offensive line, would you even go C plus on the offensive line? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2199.04s)]
*  Bowers we like. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2203.92s)]
*  But yeah, there was a lot of work left with that team. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2206.76s)]
*  There's still fourth best in the division and there's still two games behind [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2210.12s)]
*  Denver, according to this. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2213.64s)]

*  There's only 16 teams left and you're up five. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2266.48s)]
*  You know, you found the perfect game. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2269.4s)]
*  And what was his name? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2272.04s)]
*  Duke was in your corner and he almost didn't let you out for the seventh round here. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2273.0s)]
*  And you're like, no, no, no, don't you dare throw that towel in, but all right. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2276.76s)]
*  Let's see what you got. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2281.2400000000002s)]
*  I think it's a damn show. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2281.88s)]
*  He thinks it's a damn fight. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2283.0s)]
*  Philadelphia are defending Superbowl champions. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2287.76s)]
*  I know that kills you just to hear those words. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2291.04s)]
*  Oh, disgusting. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2292.88s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2294.68s)]
*  They have endless amounts of money to just, I know they lost some starters. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2295.36s)]
*  They didn't lose any of like their best eight or nine guys. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2298.88s)]
*  I'm with you, man. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2301.96s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2302.44s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2303.44s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2303.92s)]
*  I get people, you know, I have smart people telling me, Oh, just follow the money. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2304.2799999999997s)]
*  It's like, no, I don't just roll it over and just keep rolling it over. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2308.44s)]
*  And the bills do eventually. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2311.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2313.16s)]
*  Cool. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2313.4s)]
*  Creative accounting. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2314.0s)]
*  It's what the Niners did. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2315.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2316.48s)]
*  Just, uh, I know it's sour grapes, but whatever. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2316.72s)]
*  They're paying 50 million a year for the QB 57 million for the two receivers. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2319.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2324.4s)]
*  And now 12 million a year for Saquon Barkley. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2324.6800000000003s)]
*  Somehow that's all legal under the cap. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2326.88s)]
*  They've Jay Lee Carter coming. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2328.92s)]
*  They paid bond who's like, Oh yeah. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2330.36s)]
*  Well, oh my God, somebody's going to grab them. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2331.92s)]
*  Nope. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2333.36s)]
*  They kept him. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2333.6800000000003s)]
*  Um, but I get the bottle because you have to just keep nailing the draft. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2334.88s)]
*  You let the veterans go and you move those draft picks. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2338.76s)]
*  You move in and it makes sense. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2341.0s)]
*  It's just, it's just weird. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2342.56s)]
*  But when the salary cap goes up 30 million every year, I just can't believe [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2344.0s)]
*  any team can afford two primetime receivers and a receiver's thing. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2348.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2353.04s)]
*  The Cowboys did that. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2353.2799999999997s)]
*  They would be 90 million over the cap. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2354.24s)]
*  Like we, we, we just want to pay three guys and we can't do it. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2356.4s)]
*  So, right. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2359.68s)]
*  But, but maybe you can pay the three guys. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2360.72s)]
*  Maybe that's the lesson. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2363.0s)]
*  You pay Parsons, Lam and Dak and everybody else could pay three guys. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2364.4s)]
*  Why can't you pay three guys? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2367.92s)]
*  Just your draft Georgia offensive linemen and defensive tackles. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2369.2s)]
*  And in two, three years, they'll all work out. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2373.08s)]
*  We'll be fine. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2375.4s)]
*  We'll till dominate. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2376.16s)]
*  What was your reaction to the whatever was going on on the social media the [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2377.56s)]
*  last 24 hours with the guy claiming that Dak might get traded to the Cleveland Browns? [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2381.92s)]
*  I know you saw it. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2386.04s)]
*  I ignored it. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2387.2799999999997s)]
*  I, I, you know, can't even figure out how that would work. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2388.08s)]
*  Well, you know, it's like, you know, when we have friends telling us, you [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2390.7999999999997s)]
*  got to bet this, you got to bet this. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2393.6s)]
*  And depending on the friend, you're like, no, I'm going to stay away. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2395.16s)]
*  That's kind of how I was with this rumor mill. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2397.64s)]
*  Like whoever was passing it along, I was like, oh, that guy, credibility. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2399.56s)]
*  This is dumb. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2403.24s)]
*  But yeah, that's, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2404.16s)]
*  so the thing would be, you would take the Sean's contract and trade [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2405.4s)]
*  DAC and just get killed for a year. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2410.6800000000003s)]
*  But you would then be able to reset your, I don't even get, but now you [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2413.04s)]
*  wouldn't have a quarterback. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2415.6000000000004s)]
*  They would, they would have to lead Jerry off in handcuffs, a straight Jack. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2416.88s)]
*  The guys at the white coast would just have to take him away at that point. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2422.04s)]
*  He's like, I've traded Dak Prescott for the Sean and a future second round pick. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2426.52s)]
*  And I'm going to become a professional actor. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2430.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2433.0s)]
*  Tara Sheridan is building a new show around me as an aging NFL owner. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2433.6s)]

*  Is it? [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2449.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2450.12s)]
*  Playing the NFC NFC North and the AFC West. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2451.7200000000003s)]
*  That's pretty hard. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2456.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2457.7200000000003s)]

*  Gotta love that. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2461.8399999999997s)]
*  Not to mention first place schedule. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2462.4399999999996s)]
*  They're playing Thursday, the first game of the year. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2464.16s)]

*  That's where it's gotta be 11 and a half. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2478.64s)]
*  And it's 11 and a half. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2481.52s)]
*  This is the money both ways. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2484.0s)]
*  I can't, I swear I'm not cheating. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2486.52s)]
*  Philly minus one 65 to win the division, by the way. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2491.72s)]
*  Oh, just for the record, since we did the AFC ones, Casey's minus one 50. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2494.8799999999997s)]

*  And the bills are minus 10. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2503.48s)]
*  Those are new to those divisions weren't up till today either. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2505.56s)]

*  If you can talk yourself into the Colts of plus two 90. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2524.1200000000003s)]

*  Let's not do it. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2541.6800000000003s)]
*  And then, uh, chargers plus three 30 and Broncos plus four 90 Raiders 12 to one. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2543.48s)]
*  If you want to get excited about that for your division. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2549.44s)]

*  Um, I battled between nine and a half and 10 and a half for this. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2579.96s)]
*  And I went 10 and a half. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2583.44s)]
*  All right. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2585.2799999999997s)]

*  What's the case? [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2711.8799999999997s)]
*  Because we were selectively aggressive during the free agent period. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2712.8399999999997s)]
*  We extended OSA. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2717.24s)]
*  We got Fowler, a guy had 10 and a half sacks last year. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2718.8399999999997s)]

*  You signed Javante Williams and miles Sanders. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2727.64s)]
*  You get your punt. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2729.7999999999997s)]

*  Why not? [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2780.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2780.32s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2784.6800000000003s)]
*  They got to get hard knocks back in New York. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2786.0s)]
*  I know Joe Shane's going to lock his doors. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2787.76s)]
*  I got to let anybody in, but they have that quarterback room with Jameis Ross and [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2789.48s)]
*  Tommy DeVito. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2794.52s)]
*  What laughs then that's before they even throw any pick sixes. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2795.96s)]
*  What did they possibly see from Russell Wilson in the last six games of the season [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2799.84s)]

*  I do not understand it. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2810.12s)]
*  What is that? [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2811.44s)]
*  What's the game plan for that? [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2812.12s)]

*  Coin flip. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2822.6s)]

*  Well, we're not getting 2015 Russell Wilson. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2839.36s)]
*  He doesn't run. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2842.0s)]

*  He went to Denver. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2852.76s)]
*  It went so bad that they paid him to go away and then went to the Steelers who [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2853.6800000000003s)]

*  Yeah, that's a disaster. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2913.44s)]
*  What's the division odds? [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2914.88s)]
*  Division odds. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2918.2799999999997s)]
*  Giants 20 to one. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2921.4s)]
*  Is that the biggest one we've had so far? [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2923.04s)]
*  Cleveland's 23 to one. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2924.8799999999997s)]
*  Dallas seven to one. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2926.44s)]
*  Washington plus two 50 Eagles minus one 65. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2928.0s)]
*  I like don't mind that. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2931.3599999999997s)]
*  Washington's a total. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2932.44s)]
*  Washington's a play. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2933.3599999999997s)]
*  I don't mind that one at all. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2934.7999999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2936.08s)]
*  And it's just so the NFC East 34 wins. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2936.72s)]
*  AFC East 33. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2940.2s)]
*  I don't know about that. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2942.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't agree with that Giants number at all. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2944.92s)]
*  I, in fact, I'm going to make my first like market down prediction. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2946.52s)]
*  I think that's four and a half by the summer. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2950.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2953.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't think that stays there. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2953.52s)]
*  Can I tell the story? [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2955.12s)]
*  But being in Vegas, so I bet the Giants have the worst record in the league last [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2956.56s)]
*  year and they were three and 14, right? [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2960.64s)]
*  But it tied with three other teams. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2963.3599999999997s)]
*  So it's a four way split. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2965.16s)]
*  So I go to cash this. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2966.72s)]
*  I don't have to say what casino this is, but I go to cash it in. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2967.68s)]
*  So I should, you know, I was about to win $1,300. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2971.04s)]
*  So if you split it four ways, I went 300 and change. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2974.3199999999997s)]
*  So I presented to the counter. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2977.48s)]
*  Uh, it's a miracle. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2979.24s)]
*  I'm cashing a futures ticket from last year. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2980.08s)]
*  And the guy's like, nope, this is a loser. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2982.96s)]
*  I was like, well, how does this lose? [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2985.08s)]
*  I pull up on my phone. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2986.2400000000002s)]
*  There's four teams with three, with three wins. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2987.2s)]
*  Then he brings this guy over. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2990.2400000000002s)]
*  He couldn't have been older than 19 years old. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2991.64s)]
*  He's got this thing that resembles a phone that he's looking into. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2993.92s)]
*  The Giants lose on a tiebreaker to the Browns and he lists six tie breaking [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=2997.16s)]
*  scenarios and they lost on the sixth time. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3001.4s)]
*  I was like, wait a minute. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3003.64s)]
*  Isn't this dead heat rules? [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3004.76s)]
*  And it was like, no, we don't do Teddy, sir. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3006.32s)]
*  This is how we do it. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3008.8s)]
*  And you lost on the sixth tie breaker. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3009.88s)]
*  I'm like, all right. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3011.52s)]
*  I don't even know what you're looking into, by the way. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3012.24s)]
*  You could be, you know, you could be, I'm not sure what you could be, but, and I [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3014.36s)]
*  hate when they're indignant about it. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3018.28s)]
*  Like, um, yeah, like TSA is like when you fly from and they're like, you have to [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3019.72s)]
*  take your laptop out, like, all right, well, I just flew in from Fort Worth and I [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3025.0s)]
*  didn't have to, and they're like, they're so dickish about it. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3029.2s)]
*  But anyway, I lost because of the sixth tie breaker. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3032.0s)]
*  That feels like fraud. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3036.48s)]
*  I know. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3038.44s)]
*  It's like all this rooting I did for nothing. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3039.2s)]
*  Kind of wish you would name the casino, but, um, that's unbelievable. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3041.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3046.8s)]
*  NFC North Detroit, 15 and two last year. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3047.7599999999998s)]
*  That's not happening again. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3050.32s)]
*  They do play the NFC East and the AFC North. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3052.32s)]
*  So giants, that's an easy game. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3056.32s)]
*  Maybe your team's easy. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3059.7599999999998s)]
*  Steelers Brown's easy. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3062.52s)]
*  Maybe Steelers are easy if they don't get a quarterback. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3064.56s)]
*  A lot of trouble with this. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3066.64s)]
*  I'm going to say 11 and a half. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3068.12s)]
*  That's what I have 11 and a half. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3070.08s)]
*  Is it higher? [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3072.68s)]
*  It is 10 and a half. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3075.0s)]
*  That's bad. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3077.92s)]
*  That's wrong. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3079.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you this much. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3081.0s)]
*  There's, there's a action on the under of all things. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3083.2s)]
*  Wow. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3087.04s)]
*  Minus one 40 under 10 and a half. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3088.3199999999997s)]
*  That's a lot of trouble. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3092.16s)]
*  Minus one 40 under 10 and a half. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3093.16s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3098.8399999999997s)]
*  That's wrong. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3099.48s)]
*  This team had the year from hell. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3100.2s)]
*  Injury wise, you're not going to find a worst example of like a team that was [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3101.7599999999998s)]
*  plagued with injuries and they won 15 games and now you're taking four and a [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3106.08s)]
*  half games off their total. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3109.92s)]
*  They can get the whole defense back. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3112.04s)]
*  I know the division's tough. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3113.52s)]
*  They lost both coordinators. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3115.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3117.24s)]
*  That's not nothing. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3118.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3119.24s)]
*  They, they had a horrible end to the season. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3119.7599999999998s)]
*  Yep. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3124.64s)]
*  And they lose call to your team. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3125.0s)]
*  Four and a half wins. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3129.24s)]
*  They replaced them though. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3130.36s)]
*  They replaced them with a cornerback. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3131.52s)]
*  Everybody likes. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3132.7999999999997s)]
*  They did. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3133.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3133.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3134.24s)]
*  And we haven't seen the draft yet. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3134.88s)]
*  I like the over. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3137.92s)]
*  I'm saying I like the over. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3138.92s)]
*  Why is that four and a half different? [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3139.96s)]
*  Like Minnesota is not going to win 14 games. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3141.56s)]
*  So they'll write. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3143.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3145.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't even know that the division is better. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3146.12s)]
*  So you would bet the lions plus one 20 at over 10 and a half right now. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3148.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3152.84s)]
*  11 and six. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3153.52s)]
*  I really liked that one too. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3155.0s)]
*  I almost that line so suspicious. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3156.88s)]
*  I must feel like we don't know something. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3158.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3161.2s)]
*  Like, what do they know that we don't know that Dan Campbell bit all the knee [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3162.7599999999998s)]
*  caps off. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3167.44s)]
*  There's none left. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3168.04s)]
*  Dan Campbell has been deranged all off season. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3169.2s)]
*  Minnesota was 14 and three last year. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3175.0s)]
*  This is so hard. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3178.4s)]
*  And they changed their quarterback from the great Sam Darnold to JJ McCarthy, [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3178.92s)]
*  who we have not seen play NFL yet. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3183.96s)]
*  Tough for schedule second place. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3187.36s)]
*  I can't, this is the low biggest drop off 14 and three, but I went nine and a [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3189.72s)]
*  half for them. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3194.6s)]
*  I don't see how it can be in the tens. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3195.7999999999997s)]
*  I went eight and a half. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3197.7999999999997s)]
*  I think this is an impossible one to pick. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3199.0s)]
*  I think nine and eight would be good for them. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3202.24s)]
*  You motherfucker. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3205.12s)]
*  Is it? [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3206.68s)]
*  Eight and a half. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3207.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3208.72s)]
*  That is plus one 15 right now. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3210.4s)]
*  That's what I mean. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3213.84s)]

*  You figured it out. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3223.64s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3225.6s)]
*  I did it. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3226.4s)]
*  You're going to have to pull me in 10. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3227.04s)]
*  I think you've clicked. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3228.52s)]
*  I think I'd have to like get all the rest ones just to tie you. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3229.6s)]
*  That's it. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3233.04s)]
*  What a, what a beating this was. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3234.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3236.08s)]
*  So that is a full fledge. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3236.32s)]
*  We don't trust JJ McCarthy number. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3238.12s)]
*  So that's the biggest drop off five and a half from 14 and a half. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3240.76s)]
*  Five and a half drop off and JJ McCarthy might be good. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3245.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3248.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3249.44s)]
*  Vikings dare I say a little, nobody believes in us. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3250.56s)]
*  And there's still some Aaron Rodgers. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3253.44s)]
*  If you want to do the three last year, a lot of the guys are still in this locker room. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3255.12s)]
*  They went 14 and three. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3259.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3260.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3261.36s)]
*  Green Bay. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3261.76s)]
*  They went 11 and six last year. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3262.64s)]
*  Third place schedule. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3266.12s)]
*  And, um, I'll probably regret this, but I went nine and a half. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3267.32s)]
*  I did think about it. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3270.92s)]
*  10 and a half. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3271.68s)]
*  It's gotta be nine and a half. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3272.72s)]
*  And it's nine and a half, but plus one 15 on the over. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3274.6s)]
*  So they're minus one 35 on the under. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3280.04s)]
*  I think that's just right for them. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3283.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3285.16s)]
*  So division odds now Detroit plus one 10. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3286.04s)]
*  Green Bay plus two 50 bears plus four 50 and Minnesota. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3290.64s)]
*  With the worst odds of anyone at plus five 50, but I should have done that [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3296.0s)]
*  before we did after we did the bears. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3301.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3303.84s)]
*  Well, now you're going to, you can maybe lock in there. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3304.24s)]
*  Maybe I can cheat. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3307.44s)]
*  Um, well, I had eight and a half for them anyway. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3309.16s)]
*  They're five and 12 last year. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3312.12s)]
*  NFC East, AFC North. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3314.12s)]
*  Um, they spent a lot of money in the lines. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3316.48s)]
*  They're going to have a high draft pick. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3319.88s)]
*  And with the way that a vision's kind of falling back to them a little bit, [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3322.08s)]
*  it seems like an eight and a half. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3325.76s)]
*  What'd you have? [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3326.8s)]
*  I went nine only because it was nine last year. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3327.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3329.92s)]
*  Like, wasn't that weird? [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3330.2400000000002s)]
*  Remember we were betting them not to make the play out. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3331.2400000000002s)]
*  Do we bet them under nine or do we bet them not to make the playoffs? [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3333.1200000000003s)]
*  I feel like they're in love with the bears. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3336.44s)]
*  The fans are in love with the bears. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3338.52s)]
*  I know they fix that offensive line. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3339.92s)]
*  Uh, I have nine. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3342.1200000000003s)]
*  It is eight and a half. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3344.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3345.96s)]
*  Plus one 20 for the over on that one. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3346.4s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3351.7200000000003s)]
*  Not touching. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3353.08s)]
*  I don't know if I would not touching. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3353.52s)]
*  Yeah, but that is a, that is a stay away. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3354.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3357.44s)]
*  So nine and 18. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3359.32s)]
*  So that's 37 wins. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3361.92s)]
*  Is that the most? [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3364.36s)]
*  That's the most for any division. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3366.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3368.36s)]
*  Two more NFC South, Tampa Bay, 10 and seven. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3369.0s)]
*  Feel good story. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3374.52s)]
*  Playing the NFC West and the AFC East. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3377.0s)]
*  So potentially I, I, I don't really love anybody in the NFC West and we might not [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3379.48s)]
*  love three of the four teams in the AFC East. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3385.1600000000003s)]
*  So this is a nice little scenario. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3387.1600000000003s)]
*  They make it a break for the South. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3388.56s)]
*  And then, uh, you know, they're bringing their receivers back, bringing the team [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3391.04s)]
*  back, it felt like a nine and a half to me. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3395.56s)]
*  So, Oh, really? [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3398.32s)]
*  Oh, I don't think you can make any of these teams over eight and a half. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3400.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3404.28s)]
*  That's what I did. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3404.44s)]
*  And you were correct. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3406.6s)]
*  Eight and a half. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3407.6s)]
*  This is like, this is embarrassing for you. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3408.48s)]
*  I'm at this stage now where I'm bringing the shortstop to pitch the night thing. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3410.96s)]
*  He started his knuckle ball. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3416.64s)]
*  I mean, this could be a, just a giant Bill Simmons meme for 90 minutes. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3418.72s)]
*  This is great. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3422.56s)]
*  It's I'm going to make the Walton Goggins finding out that his friend had sex with [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3423.72s)]
*  everyone, Thailand face, uh, minus one 25 action for the bucks. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3429.12s)]
*  FYI. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3433.52s)]
*  Can't do it. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3435.32s)]
*  No South, no South talk told week 12 New Orleans. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3435.92s)]
*  Oh no, not New Orleans. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3440.2400000000002s)]
*  Uh, Atlanta is next. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3441.28s)]
*  So they're playing a second place schedule plus the NFC West plus the [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3443.56s)]
*  AFC East and they went eight and nine last year, full year of Pennix. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3448.2400000000002s)]
*  I put eight, eight and a half for these guys. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3454.16s)]
*  Little weird, weird off season already. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3456.44s)]

*  You're just like, I'm just trying to do this correctly. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3560.2799999999997s)]
*  Can't believe you should try harder. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3565.68s)]
*  This is like the most you've ever cheated. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3566.92s)]
*  There are round numbers. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3569.64s)]
*  I looked at five and a half or six and a half sounds like I'll just take six. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3570.68s)]
*  And it's like, price is right. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3574.12s)]
*  You're just, I sent you all the numbers from last year. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3575.52s)]
*  You could have noticed that there weren't halfs on several of them. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3578.2s)]
*  Well, it's six and a half this time. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3581.0s)]
*  We haven't had a round number yet. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3583.24s)]
*  Wait, is it six and a half or six? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3585.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's six and a half. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3587.16s)]
*  You won cause you picked six because you cheated. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3588.3199999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3590.16s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3590.7999999999997s)]
*  And then, uh, last one is Carolina five and 12 last year somehow. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3592.0s)]
*  I still can't believe I didn't win my, when I was in Boston that time and I bet the [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3598.7599999999998s)]
*  adjusted under four and a half wins for them and somehow Bryce Young came in and [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3603.3199999999997s)]
*  just smoked it. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3607.8s)]
*  They ended up with five wins. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3609.32s)]
*  I lost. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3610.48s)]
*  I still, and the other one was the adjusted under on the pats three and a half. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3611.1200000000003s)]
*  And, and, uh, Joe Milton came in at the end. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3616.32s)]
*  Joe Milton. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3620.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3622.1200000000003s)]
*  There's going to be a cowboy. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3623.76s)]
*  Joe, the next day worst quarterback. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3625.36s)]
*  Anyway, he came in. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3628.84s)]
*  By the way, that was nuts. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3629.76s)]
*  We don't think about that enough that Andy Dalton was, you know, totally [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3630.96s)]
*  content to bring them to another three and 14. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3635.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3637.8s)]
*  Then at the car accident, you should see if you're covered or your auto [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3638.1600000000003s)]
*  insurance covers that bet. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3642.32s)]
*  Like if you, do you have to pay the deductible? [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3643.8s)]
*  I won't try to find out at the casino you went to. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3645.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3648.2000000000003s)]
*  I went five and a half for the Panthers. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3648.6800000000003s)]
*  I did too. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3650.84s)]
*  Okay. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3652.0800000000004s)]
*  The answer is six and a half. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3653.44s)]
*  No, the hell are we doing? [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3656.32s)]
*  Come on. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3659.4s)]
*  Agree with that at all. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3660.6400000000003s)]
*  Why are they better than five ones last year? [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3661.76s)]
*  Holy moly. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3664.52s)]
*  Where do they pick up this extra two games? [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3665.6800000000003s)]
*  Divisions Tampa plus one 35, Atlanta plus two 30, New Orleans plus four 80 and [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3668.6400000000003s)]
*  Carolina action started out in the four slot, but now they're plus four 10. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3675.7200000000003s)]
*  People are banging the Panthers. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3680.6400000000003s)]
*  What am I missing? [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3682.0800000000004s)]
*  We may have to do that, but no South talk. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3684.0s)]
*  Hey, what was your bet last year for the South? [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3686.32s)]
*  They'd have fewer than how many wins? [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3688.1600000000003s)]
*  We, one of our locks that we hit was that they would have less than 30 [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3691.0800000000004s)]
*  wins, which they did. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3695.56s)]
*  And then we had an NFC East first, uh, first South bet. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3697.64s)]
*  And I think just the top two teams in the NFC East almost beat the entire. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3701.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3706.44s)]
*  So it's 29 this year. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3706.6s)]
*  If you add the seven and a half, eight and a half, six and a half, six and a half. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3708.04s)]
*  It's 13 and 16, 29. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3710.6s)]
*  Hit it again. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3715.0s)]
*  I gotta be honest. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3715.4s)]
*  We've done 28 teams. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3716.4s)]
*  I think my single favorite is New Orleans under six and a half so far. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3718.04s)]
*  Is it, why are they going to be good? [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3722.12s)]
*  What, what is good about them? [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3723.7599999999998s)]
*  What's the case? [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3726.56s)]
*  No, they're old. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3728.16s)]
*  They're messy. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3730.24s)]
*  They came out. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3731.24s)]
*  They're great start last year. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3731.92s)]
*  They were two and Oh, scored like a hundred points. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3733.36s)]
*  And then, then they were the saints. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3735.16s)]
*  Like if we were to say who's going to have the worst record in the week next year, they [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3737.2799999999997s)]
*  would at least be one of the teams we batted around. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3740.48s)]
*  NFC West, they're playing the NFC South and the AFC South, which I thought the NFC West. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3743.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's the best draw. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3748.68s)]
*  I thought the NFC West was probably going to suck this year, but that made me rethink [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3749.6s)]
*  it. The Rams are in the one spot with the schedule. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3753.72s)]
*  They were 10 and seven last year and and first place schedule on the one hand, but [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3756.4s)]
*  then playing the South kind of mess with my head a little bit. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3765.36s)]
*  I went 10 and a half for them. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3768.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3770.68s)]
*  I went nine. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3771.7599999999998s)]
*  So let's see. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3772.92s)]
*  I know you don't like the round numbers. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3774.24s)]
*  Nine and a half. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3776.44s)]
*  That's me. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3778.96s)]
*  Minus 145. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3779.96s)]
*  Listen. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3781.4s)]
*  I think I think this is going to be ultimately good for me because I think my instincts. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3783.92s)]
*  Will you like them? [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3790.12s)]
*  The correct instincts. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3790.92s)]
*  I do. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3791.84s)]
*  I like them because of their schedule and because I don't think their division is going [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3792.6s)]
*  to be good. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3795.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3796.4s)]
*  Do you like Arizona, San Francisco or Seattle this year? [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3797.28s)]
*  No. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3801.32s)]
*  After the Super Bowl, I picked my way too early team. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3801.96s)]
*  Odds wise, value wise, the Rams were 20 to one. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3805.28s)]
*  I was like, wow, that's pretty good. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3808.64s)]
*  They were a couple of plays away from beating the champion Eagles. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3809.7599999999998s)]
*  And then they did a smart thing, signed Stafford. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3813.56s)]
*  Awesome. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3815.84s)]
*  I think Devante Adams has juice left. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3816.92s)]
*  Flip up in the adels. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3819.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3821.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's good. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3821.7599999999998s)]
*  Uh, they're in good shape. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3822.64s)]
*  I think nine and a half is a nice number too. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3824.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3826.52s)]
*  I mean, one of the great things about this process is especially after the draft, when [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3826.8s)]
*  we get to the summer, I'm sure we'll flip flop on a bunch of these instincts, but I [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3830.6s)]
*  just think the Rams best coach, they've had success. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3837.92s)]
*  Stafford's kind of near the end. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3841.6s)]
*  Like this seems like a pretty good division bet type of thing for me. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3843.24s)]
*  Uh, Seattle, they were 10 and seven last year, same South first South second place [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3847.52s)]
*  schedule, and I went eight and a half for them. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3852.9199999999996s)]
*  I said seven and a half. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3855.72s)]
*  Uh, I hit this one eight and a half. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3858.9599999999996s)]
*  Really? [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3861.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3862.56s)]
*  No, I mean, really you won one. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3864.2s)]
*  I did really. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3866.12s)]
*  I won one. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3866.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm going to, I'm remembering all of this for guest the lines this year. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3867.7999999999997s)]
*  Um, I don't like these moves. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3871.0s)]
*  These could go very badly, but Sam Darnold and Cooper Cubs. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3873.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3877.76s)]
*  I didn't like the Cooper Cubs signing at all. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3878.76s)]
*  There was so many bad stats about him getting open over the last five years or in 2020, [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3880.4s)]
*  he was open 90% of the time and it was down like 14. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3885.1600000000003s)]
*  The thing with Darnold though, he was 14 and three last year. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3888.04s)]
*  I know. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3890.96s)]
*  So now he's an eight win quarterback. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3891.6400000000003s)]
*  That's the only thing that makes me nervous, but I want to see if they fix their [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3893.7200000000003s)]
*  offensive line completely through the draft. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3896.56s)]
*  We'll see. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3898.7200000000003s)]
*  Arizona is two. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3899.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3901.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3901.68s)]
*  No genome, no Metcalf. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3901.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3903.24s)]
*  Arizona was eight, nine last year. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3904.3199999999997s)]
*  And if Seattle's eight and a half, um, with this South South thing, I think they, [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3907.08s)]
*  I think Arizona has to be eight and a half. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3913.68s)]
*  So that's what I picked. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3915.52s)]
*  Maybe you'll beat me here. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3916.7599999999998s)]
*  I said seven, seven round number bulls. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3917.64s)]
*  It's higher. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3923.08s)]
*  Eight and a half plus one on five. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3924.16s)]
*  Well, at least I'm ending in a way with my fans can at least have some. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3927.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3930.52s)]
*  I might've let you win these last couple. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3930.6s)]
*  You took out your starters. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3932.76s)]
*  You're like Buffalo and week 17, Joe Milton let you up plus one on five. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3934.8s)]
*  And then last but not least San Francisco who lost so many people. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3939.6800000000003s)]
*  It's like a whole paragraph of all the people they lost. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3944.2000000000003s)]
*  This is so tough. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3946.4s)]
*  And yet they were six and 11 last year. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3947.88s)]
*  That was the rebuilding year, but now they're in a rebuilding year and they're [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3950.08s)]
*  going to have to pay pretty, but they are playing the South and the South. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3953.9599999999996s)]
*  Uh, I said six and a half would you have, oh, wow. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3957.04s)]
*  That eight and a half. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3960.2799999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3961.9599999999996s)]
*  Wow. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3963.2s)]
*  This is the biggest disparity we've had. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3963.3599999999997s)]
*  It's gotta be my way. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3966.9199999999996s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3967.9199999999996s)]
*  How is this right? [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3972.16s)]
*  10 and a half. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3974.4399999999996s)]
*  That's too high. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3976.4399999999996s)]
*  That's way, way in the hell. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3977.7599999999998s)]
*  What am I missing? [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3982.3599999999997s)]
*  You know, you read enough about them. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3983.6400000000003s)]

*  These were good cuts. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3986.76s)]
*  Debo Samuel, all these cuts, everything they did. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3987.5600000000004s)]
*  Green law. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3989.6800000000003s)]

*  Wait. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3996.0s)]
*  So they're favored to win the division. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3996.1600000000003s)]
*  Not the right now. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=3998.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm stunned by that. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4001.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4002.4s)]
*  San Francisco plus one 55 Rams plus one 80 Seahawks plus four 90 Cardinals plus [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4003.32s)]
*  500. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4009.48s)]
*  So I have to bet this now. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4010.88s)]
*  If I was four wins off, even though we don't know what's happening in the draft, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4012.08s)]
*  that has to be an automatic bet for me. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4015.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4018.2s)]
*  That's atrocious. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4018.44s)]
*  That's not good. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4019.48s)]
*  That's not good. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4022.04s)]
*  We got to go under there. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4023.0s)]
*  Also like, how do we know McCaffrey is even going to be remotely where he was? [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4024.3199999999997s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4029.12s)]
*  That's the way to go. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4030.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4031.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4031.96s)]
*  That was very fun. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4032.24s)]
*  That was a good time. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4033.7999999999997s)]
*  And they have Mac Jones though. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4034.84s)]
*  Did you mention that they did sign them for two years? [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4035.84s)]
*  I forgot to mention Mac Jones. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4038.72s)]
*  The MVP is Lamar plus 450 Allen plus 550 Burrow plus 600. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4041.24s)]
*  So the Niners are probably like seven, seventh best to win the Super Bowl. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4046.2s)]
*  I hope that's not true for the conference. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4052.7999999999997s)]
*  They have the third best odds nine to one. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4055.7599999999998s)]
*  What am I missing? [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4057.48s)]
*  What's happening? [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4058.72s)]
*  I think it's way more likely they have a year from hell again. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4059.64s)]
*  And Shanahan is like out of there. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4062.08s)]
*  I missed the whole off season. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4064.12s)]
*  I really do. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4065.7599999999998s)]
*  I was there for the whole off season. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4066.96s)]
*  I didn't see anything that made me think that they're going to be awesome. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4068.96s)]
*  I thought they lost that shitload of people. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4072.52s)]
*  I mean, do we feel like they hit their drafts the last couple of years? [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4075.08s)]
*  Like, you know, they're trying to trade IUK as we speak and I don't even think [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4077.56s)]
*  they can do that. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4081.28s)]
*  Nobody wants to come out and ACL. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4081.92s)]
*  Yeah, they were, they were riding high off the purdy, not having to pay him. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4084.16s)]
*  Now it's, I got to look into that. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4087.44s)]
*  We're missing something. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4089.92s)]
*  Let's do a quick parent corner before we go. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4091.2000000000003s)]
*  All right. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4093.64s)]
*  My son Archie is home on spring break. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4095.04s)]
*  They do quarters. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4096.76s)]
*  So he gets home and I say, like, how are your grades? [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4097.68s)]
*  And he looked kind of like half asses of response and everything and immediately [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4102.200000000001s)]
*  shifts gears and tells me he's on season four of The Sopranos. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4107.200000000001s)]
*  And I was like, oh, that's great. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4111.280000000001s)]
*  That's better. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4112.92s)]
*  You could have told me you're you're. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4113.72s)]
*  You're mafia cum laude right now. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4116.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, that's all I care about. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4118.400000000001s)]
*  That's what college should be all about, right? [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4120.76s)]
*  Spend tens of thousands of dollars a semester to catch up on classic TV shows. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4122.84s)]
*  Your dorm and reading a great novel. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4127.4s)]
*  Yeah, it really is. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4130.4s)]
*  So I was like, oh, sorry. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4131.5199999999995s)]
*  So you're in season four. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4132.44s)]
*  You got like a season and a half. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4133.24s)]
*  I was like, I want to watch the finale with you. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4134.32s)]
*  And he's like, I don't know. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4136.88s)]
*  Once I get going, I really I don't know. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4137.92s)]
*  Am I really going to be able to stop short and not watch the finale for like a month? [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4139.799999999999s)]

*  But it made me think, like, if you had to watch a finale with your kids. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4146.24s)]
*  Who are viewing for the first time, which ones would you put up there? [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4150.96s)]
*  Sopranos, only sopranos. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4155.679999999999s)]
*  Anything else? [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4157.639999999999s)]
*  Bringing bad or not as much? [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4158.5599999999995s)]
*  No, only sopranos. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4161.32s)]
*  Just for the reaction, right? [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4164.04s)]
*  There was this clip going around of people watching Tommy get shot and goodfellas. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4167.84s)]
*  You see that different reactions, right? [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4172.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4174.88s)]
*  And I would think that would be the TV version of of that. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4175.679999999999s)]
*  Watching people react like, wait, what? [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4178.5599999999995s)]
*  Wait, what? [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4181.48s)]
*  I think you're right. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4182.5199999999995s)]
*  That was the maddest I've ever seen in a non sports related. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4184.0s)]
*  I'm still mad that you're not mad about it. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4186.92s)]
*  I really do. Yeah, now I think it's great. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4189.24s)]
*  But I know it's going to happen. I know it's happening now. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4191.16s)]
*  You liked it right away. You did. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4193.32s)]
*  But it's no, I do not like it right away. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4195.4s)]
*  I didn't sensical. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4197.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, I guess no one hated it as much as I did. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4199.0s)]
*  But I had a terrible reaction to I didn't want to be friends with anyone who liked it. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4201.6s)]
*  I like I like that is such a cheap way to go out. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4205.16s)]
*  But the answer is he left it open ended because he's a movie maker. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4207.84s)]
*  He wanted to maybe make a movie. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4213.44s)]
*  What? That's the only answer. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4215.36s)]
*  So he didn't die. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4217.4s)]
*  This is how he set it up. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4218.719999999999s)]
*  That this is what death is like. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4221.5199999999995s)]
*  You don't know when it's coming and everything goes black bullshit. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4223.639999999999s)]
*  So my son, like five days ago. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4229.08s)]
*  First spring break went to Portugal and Spain, [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4234.08s)]
*  because he's in this he plays the upright bass and he's in this jazz band. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4237.759999999999s)]
*  So a bunch of the jazz people went to play in all these places. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4241.92s)]
*  So they my wife drives them like in the middle of the night to the airport [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4246.68s)]
*  because they have like a six o'clock flight. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4251.08s)]
*  And then he's flying for two days straight. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4253.12s)]
*  I wanted to read you all of our interactions with him since he's been gone. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4257.0s)]
*  He's been gone since Friday night and WhatsApp, because they don't have [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4260.68s)]
*  messages, anything. Right. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4266.04s)]
*  And. First of all, she only hears from him once on WhatsApp, [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4267.84s)]
*  then puts me on a text with them. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4272.72s)]
*  Miss you guys, too. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4276.6s)]
*  That was that was one. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4278.92s)]
*  We are in Rondo and are about to perform in four minutes. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4281.96s)]
*  Second form of communication with them sent us one, two pictures of [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4284.8s)]
*  you can see of the tree in a mountain. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4290.72s)]
*  Nice. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4294.32s)]
*  My wife asked, how is the performance? [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4295.16s)]

*  Need a photo of your face, my wife says. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4314.2s)]
*  Nothing. Then silence again. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4317.92s)]
*  Hey, guys, super long day. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4322.12s)]
*  We left at nine and just got back. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4323.56s)]
*  My wife responds, that's your report. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4325.88s)]
*  Anything else happening? Is it any fun? [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4327.96s)]
*  Sends us back this picture. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4331.6s)]
*  What is it? I couldn't see what it's just the picture of him and his friend [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4334.320000000001s)]
*  with the mountain behind them. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4338.0s)]
*  And he says, it is fun. It's just a lot. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4339.88s)]
*  Yeah. And that's it. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4343.360000000001s)]
*  Those have been all of our interactions with them. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4346.4400000000005s)]
*  Has he tried to call us once? [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4348.200000000001s)]
*  Only one picture of his face. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4350.92s)]
*  And I have no idea if he's even alive in spade right now. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4352.64s)]
*  I was trying to my wife and I were talking about, I was trying to remember, [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4357.28s)]
*  was I this much of a dick when I was 17? [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4359.8s)]
*  And I think the answer is probably yes. Right. Yeah. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4362.0s)]
*  We should want to deal with our parents in any way, shape or form when we're 17. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4364.32s)]
*  Right. We didn't have WhatsApp and anything else like that, too. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4368.28s)]
*  So it wasn't as easy. So maybe that's a little. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4371.72s)]
*  Yeah. But maybe we. It's hard to believe there was a one moment [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4374.16s)]
*  where he's like, you know what, I'm going to send my parents an update. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4377.08s)]
*  Just a long paragraph. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4380.280000000001s)]

*  No, nothing. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4387.280000000001s)]
*  I think the big news is who the hell knew that Ben Simmons played the upright [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4388.68s)]
*  base after all these years on an international level? [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4392.400000000001s)]

*  I don't know who could figure that out. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4406.6s)]
*  I bet on them. And soccer. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4407.52s)]
*  I have a bunch of Portuguese. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4408.8s)]
*  I didn't mean to mention Portugal and Spain in a non-soccer context. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4410.56s)]
*  You just reminded me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHZGmlCgIA&t=4414.320000000001s)]
