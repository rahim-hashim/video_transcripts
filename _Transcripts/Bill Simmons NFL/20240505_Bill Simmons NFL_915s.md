# Winners and Losers of the Tom Brady Roast | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [May 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Krg95AltiXU)
*  I just watched the roast of Tom Brady,
*  which I should have gone to.
*  All week I was planning on going,
*  had some stuff popping up and I was just like,
*  you know what, I'll just, I'm driving to Englewood,
*  I'll just stay here, I'll watch it.
*  I really regret not going because
*  the best way I can describe it for me
*  and probably every other Patriots fan who's watching it,
*  it was like being at a wedding
*  where people start going up and giving toasts,
*  your family members,
*  and it's getting progressively crazier and crazier
*  and you're like, oh my God,
*  I can't believe Uncle Bob said that about Aunt Janet.
*  Oh Jesus, Uncle Don's going up.
*  And you just don't know what's gonna happen next
*  and it's all these people that have been in your life
*  but it feels like all of a sudden there are no rules
*  and there's a microphone.
*  And that's what it was like.
*  It went so much better than I ever expected.
*  I wanna rip through it.
*  I did a little Winners and Losers.
*  And the biggest winner was Netflix
*  because Netflix over and over again
*  figures out how to win.
*  This is not a message paid for by Netflix.
*  Just, fantasy texted this to my little group today
*  and I couldn't agree more.
*  They just put in the perfect night.
*  Somehow there's no sports.
*  It was the kind of like live cultural event
*  that barely exists anymore
*  unless you have sports or award shows.
*  And it was just unpredictable.
*  I thought I would be popping in and out,
*  not really watching, maybe even like,
*  leaving, coming back later.
*  You didn't know what was gonna happen next
*  which was the whole point of a live thing.
*  But the bigger thing is comedy and roasts
*  and there hadn't been a roast in a while.
*  Roast felt like they had kind of died by the mid 2010s.
*  They were just getting super, super, super vicious
*  and not as fun and playful and weird and unpredictable
*  as they used to be 20 years ago,
*  partly because on the Comedy Central ones they were taped.
*  So the live element I thought really, really helped.
*  But they had big stars, it was funny
*  and there was really, really, really no limits.
*  And you could feel that immediately when people started,
*  when Kevin Hart was making jokes about Brady's ex-wife
*  and the jujitsu instructor.
*  I can't say jujitsu instructor, there we go.
*  And that was, I don't know, maybe five, six minutes in
*  and I was watching, I'm like, oh my God.
*  He brought up the jujitsu instructor, I can't believe it.
*  Brady must be dying.
*  And by the hour mark that was not even one
*  of the five worst things that anybody said.
*  It just kept getting crazier and crazier.
*  There were Aaron Hernandez jokes,
*  there were totally inappropriate jokes.
*  It was so inappropriate
*  that everything became appropriate after a while.
*  I don't know what the line would have been
*  and that's what a roast should be.
*  The whole point of a roast is cross the lines.
*  Everybody's here, everyone's on the same team.
*  We're just gonna say the meanest, funniest things possible
*  and it's okay.
*  And they brought that back.
*  So kudos to Netflix, kudos to Kevin Hart,
*  Jeff Ross and everybody who put this together.
*  A little bit about winners and losers.
*  So winner, Bill Belichick, who again,
*  I've talked about this before in a podcast,
*  but is somebody that people don't realize is kind of funny
*  and the whole time was like doing that press conference
*  and there was actually a little more there.
*  He came out, his speech was, or not his speech,
*  his roast was, I thought, good.
*  I mean, considering what you would have expected,
*  he came out and he said,
*  the roast of Tom Brady, not to be confused
*  with the 10 part roast of Bill Belichick
*  on the Apple TV series.
*  Unbelievable, great job by him.
*  My favorite part of it, there are two favorite parts.
*  One is the only player, ex-player,
*  ex-patriot that he picked on was Danny Amendola
*  and he went after him hard and it seemed pointed
*  and it kind of seemed out of nowhere,
*  but if you follow the Patriots,
*  Amendola was very critical of Belichick
*  in the Apple series and just in general
*  has been kind of a dick about Belichick.
*  So Belichick's like, this is great,
*  I'm gonna take shots at him
*  and some of his lack of production.
*  I love that.
*  The other thing was, it got a tiny bit emotional at the end
*  when he was having the moment with Brady
*  and there's just so much respect
*  and especially when you're watching stuff from afar
*  and the guys are taking maybe tiny shots at each other
*  or people are writing these long written reports
*  about how they don't get along and it was like,
*  and you could tell, whatever,
*  they lasted all that time together
*  and there's still some mutual respect
*  and I thought it was cool.
*  I'm not saying I was sitting there on the couch sobbing,
*  but it was cool to see.
*  Another winner and also might have been a loser
*  at the same time, Jeffrey Ross, my friend,
*  who made a craft massage joke.
*  They show craft and it's like, oh no, he's gonna do it
*  and then he does it and Brady goes up and says,
*  like basically like yells at him,
*  like don't do that shit again or whatever.
*  Went viral obviously.
*  I'm like 70% sure Brady was mad about the craft joke
*  and 30% I feel like Jeff was like,
*  if craft's here, somebody's gotta make a massage joke,
*  so why don't I'll do it,
*  then you come up to the podium and pretend you're mad at me.
*  But it was great for Jeff.
*  I mean the two best pop culture things for Jeff are this
*  and when Sal pranked him and he actually got voted off
*  at Dancing with the Stars.
*  He's getting a ton of mileage out of this.
*  So Jeff will give 230 interviews about the craft joke
*  and he'll give 300 interviews about how Tom Brady's
*  not really mad at him and they really get along.
*  I'm a little suspicious.
*  Drew Bledsoe was a winner.
*  Great sense of humor to go up there.
*  I liked his roast.
*  I thought he had some good ones.
*  But you know, you go to this thing
*  and one of the reasons that some people don't wanna do them
*  is if you're on the dais,
*  even if you're just sitting there, you become a target
*  and he just didn't give a shit, which I loved.
*  One of the things I love about Bledsoe is he's totally
*  in that peace with how this whole thing played out,
*  it seems, and he makes the self-deprecating jokes about it
*  and how now he didn't turn into an alcoholic
*  but he does own a winery.
*  I just thought he was a big winner.
*  The big loser, and I'll go back to some of the winners,
*  but Kim Kardashian, unbelievable.
*  My wife is flying from Boston right now
*  and it was the only time I texted her.
*  I was like, Kim Kardashian just got legit booed
*  at the Tom Brady roast.
*  Is this a thing that happened?
*  Yeah, it was a thing that happened.
*  To the point that people on the dais felt uncomfortable
*  and started applauding to try to shift the crowd
*  away from it, but man, going against Taylor Swift,
*  just a lot of repercussions, but people did not wanna see her.
*  I've never seen that at a roast before.
*  Another loser was Foxboro High, which just repeated jokes
*  because that was the legendary Belichick thing
*  about how even the fucking guy at Foxboro High
*  would know how to do that.
*  A loser but also a winner because when was the last time
*  you saw Foxboro High?
*  Gronk and Edelman were both winners.
*  I thought their roasts were funny.
*  One of the reasons I thought this roast was gonna be bad
*  was that Gronk and Edelman would be two of the people
*  doing roasts, but they did a great job.
*  Edelman had some killer one-liners.
*  These were my favorites, I wrote that three.
*  In case you didn't know, Alex Guerrero
*  is the snake oil salesman who turned Tom Brady
*  into a fucking weirdo, unbelievable.
*  And every time they cut to Alex Guerrero,
*  loser by the way, every time they cut to him,
*  he's like, oh, this is so funny, you know he's dying inside.
*  Edelman said, so many legendary patriots tonight,
*  I figured the next time I see you all
*  would be at Craft's funeral.
*  Wow.
*  And then he said to Brady, he starts busting Brady's balls,
*  he's like, who's laughing?
*  Not you because your face can't move
*  since you're a hoover.
*  I thought that was great.
*  And the other great thing about Gronk,
*  and Gronk was obviously insane,
*  but anyone who knows the patriots knows
*  that he was gonna be insane,
*  and it felt like he was going off the rails
*  when he did his to the point that
*  Kevin Hart even mentioned after,
*  it was like, wow, I didn't know where that was going.
*  Gronk and Edelman, every time they cut to them,
*  I loved their reactions,
*  because Edelman had that kind of open mouth laugh,
*  like, ugh, and then Gronk,
*  Gronk just, his different reactions,
*  because he was probably the biggest butt
*  of the jokes tonight, he just was really good.
*  Part of the keys to the roast are that
*  people in the day is how they're selling the jokes
*  when they're about them,
*  and if you watch like Jeff Ross,
*  Nikki Glaser, people like that,
*  they know how to really overlap and sell it.
*  Gronk, Edelman, those guys weren't doing that,
*  but they were doing a fun version of it that I liked.
*  Kevin Hart, I thought, was a really good host.
*  I think Jamie Foxx during the Emmett Smith roast
*  is the best hosted performance I've ever seen,
*  but Kevin Hart was good too,
*  because you have to have your material at the top,
*  but then you also have to play with
*  what's happening over the course of the night,
*  maybe react a little to some of the roast things.
*  I thought he did a good job.
*  Nikki Glaser was fantastic,
*  and probably did the best start to finish thing.
*  I thought her favorite one,
*  the best one was how did you lose 30 million in crypto?
*  Even Gronk was like, you know that, not real money.
*  That fucking slayed, people loved that one.
*  I was thinking for a couple losers,
*  I mentioned Alex Guerrero, the Apple doc,
*  I mean poor Apple spends all that money
*  in the Patriots thing, which I guess people watch.
*  Then Netflix comes with this Tom Brady roast,
*  flies a bunch of celebrities in,
*  and gets way more interesting Patriots stuff
*  in three hours on a live show than that documentary did.
*  Aaron Hernandez, a loser yet again,
*  the butt of a lot of jokes,
*  the butt of a lot of inappropriate jokes.
*  Once one person went after Hernandez, it just kept going.
*  Dina White I felt like was a borderline loser.
*  I don't know why they had him roast for a minute,
*  but I probably wouldn't have done that.
*  And then a lot of the jokes about him were pretty pointed
*  about him exploiting MMA fighters.
*  But I can't imagine, I wonder if he would do that over again.
*  Randy Moss's outfit, definitely a loser.
*  I was glad people made movie-usher jokes about it.
*  For some winners, Eli Manning,
*  I thought was a huge win for him.
*  He was kind of the go-to.
*  He's the one guy who beat you,
*  and then Brady finally acknowledged it.
*  The Jiu-Jitsu instructor, big win for him tonight.
*  I don't know if he was watching, but I'm sure he loved it.
*  Rose, in general, big winner.
*  Because I feel like Rose now has to come back.
*  There's no way this wasn't a massive success for Netflix.
*  Twitter means way less than it used to mean,
*  but this was number one trending.
*  So many people were texting me, are you there?
*  Oh my God, this is unbelievable.
*  So big win for them.
*  Losers, Brady's marriage, tough one.
*  I was wondering, did the kids watch this?
*  Did his ex-wife watch this?
*  There's, oof.
*  The one thing, I thought the two things
*  that made him super uncomfortable
*  were when Jeff made the Bob Kraft massage joke,
*  and then a couple times,
*  people played the Bridget Moynihan card,
*  and that was the one that he was just dying.
*  Just absolutely dying.
*  Absolutely dying, and you could Google
*  some of the reasons for that.
*  But I was surprised that people went there.
*  The only thing that nobody made a joke about was his hair.
*  And it made me wonder, did they tell people
*  the hair is off limits?
*  It seemed like it was the one thing that was off limits.
*  I thought for sure at least one person would be like,
*  how the fuck do you have more hair now
*  than you had 20 years ago?
*  But nobody did, so that was interesting.
*  Although Edelman did make plastic surgery stuff.
*  Kevin Hart got Kraft and Belichick to do a shot together.
*  And I wouldn't have believed it
*  if I didn't watch it with my own eyes.
*  And he was trying to get it going,
*  and I'm like, there's no way this will fucking happen,
*  because Belichick hates Kraft.
*  I mean, you know all the reasons why.
*  And Kraft, he mentions it.
*  All of a sudden, Kraft's wandering up to the stage,
*  and he's grabbing a glass.
*  Now Belichick has to go, and Belichick goes up,
*  and it just could not have been icier.
*  Belichick's body language,
*  you know those body language experts
*  that, I mean I'm a body language expert for basketball,
*  but those body language experts
*  that they have the TikTok accounts.
*  Somebody analyzing Belichick's body language
*  as he acknowledged Kraft, did the shot,
*  but kind of turned away from him at the same time,
*  and then Kraft had to do his bullshit,
*  I always said he was the greatest football coach
*  of all time, and Belichick's like,
*  yeah, whatever, fuck you, dude.
*  I just love the Belichick energy of this whole thing.
*  I thought this was such an absolute win
*  for Belichick.
*  And a lot of these people, like Edelman Gronk,
*  I'm glad people finally got to see
*  how absolutely insane Gronk is.
*  A couple other jokes I really liked.
*  Kevin Hart saying Tom Brady's been fucking so much
*  that his dick has CTE, that killed me.
*  CMJ, who was good, had that,
*  you took out illegal PPE loans, didn't raise your kids,
*  you left the Patriots because you were too black for Boston,
*  that killed.
*  That was, I thought, one of the biggest laughs of the night.
*  Andrew Schultz said Bill Belichick has secretly
*  filmed more guys in the other team than did he.
*  Got the biggest whoa noise from the crowd.
*  And then, you know, the last winner was Brady,
*  who I still don't really fully understand why he did it,
*  but he came out at the end, it seemed like maybe he was
*  a tiny bit imbibed, I'm not sure, but he said,
*  he said about Kim Kardashian, she's terrified to be here,
*  not because of this, but because her kids
*  are home alone with dad.
*  He said, I wanna buy a piece of the Raiders,
*  I'm tired of owning the Colts and the Bills.
*  Oof, that one cut deep.
*  The Colts are Broncos that don't fuck?
*  And then he said, my favorite ring, it's not the next one,
*  it's the one that caught Bill Belichick slinking
*  out of that poor girl's house at 6 a.m.
*  Holy shit, he was bringing it.
*  I mean, my son only saw the Brady part,
*  and he was like, does Brady realize they're televised?
*  And it's like, nobody's ever seen the side of Brady,
*  everybody had heard it exists,
*  and he finally decided to show it.
*  I thought it was interesting that he left this going,
*  I miss the love of my life, pause, football,
*  which was the perfect way to go out,
*  but I thought it was a really cool night,
*  hopefully roasts are back,
*  hopefully Netflix will keep doing these,
*  and as a Patriots fan, I think this was the thing
*  in a lot of ways that gave this whole era closure,
*  having those three on stage,
*  having the Belichick craft awkwardness,
*  having the Belichick and Brady,
*  obviously there's some deep affection there,
*  having a lot of the legends up there,
*  and it was a really cool night.
*  I had a good time, everybody.
*  Three hours with the roast of Tom Brady.
