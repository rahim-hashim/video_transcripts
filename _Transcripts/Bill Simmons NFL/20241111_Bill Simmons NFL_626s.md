# What Happens to the Dallas Cowboys Now? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [November 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM)
*  What happens to the Cowboys now? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=0.0s)]
*  I just have some questions to throw you. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=2.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=4.68s)]
*  Cause your season's over. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=5.4s)]
*  Is McCarthy finished the season? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=8.08s)]
*  That's very rude. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=9.84s)]
*  I think why pay for another coach at this point? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=14.56s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=17.16s)]
*  I look, here's what I'll say. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=17.96s)]
*  The thing about them is like this is, I didn't expect them to win. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=21.6s)]
*  I really thought they would suck me back in. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=24.68s)]
*  I thought they were done, but I didn't think they were done sucking me. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=26.92s)]
*  And I thought Cooper Rush would be competitive, but this game killed me [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=29.36s)]
*  because besides a kicking game, you get to see the Cowboys incompetence [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=33.32s)]
*  on every level, right? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=37.6s)]
*  Like tackling the quarterback play was atrocious. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=38.76s)]
*  Rush had like 24 yards at halftime and then they put Trey Lance and he comes [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  in for like negative six yards with a penalty. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=45.56s)]
*  Ezekiel Elliott back with a big fumble, which, you know, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  a huge fumble in the other end zone. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=52.0s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=54.04s)]
*  It's like just that. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=54.96s)]
*  And that's more an aptitude in the front office. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  And then like, and CD Lamb, like yucking it up with the Eagles as the, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=57.92s)]
*  as the gun sounds to end the game. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=61.56s)]
*  And then we have the owner. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=63.6s)]
*  It's like every, every little aspect of it, the owner who blames the mysterious [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=64.92s)]
*  construction of his billion dollar stadium. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=69.0s)]
*  He built it where half the players are going blind. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  From someone else. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=75.2s)]
*  He built it and was in charge of every aspect of the construction. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=76.0s)]
*  He's pointing at it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=79.44s)]
*  It's like, they know where the sun is. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=80.16s)]
*  Like, good, Jerry, you go to the sun, go to the light, see the sun. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  It's right there. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=86.68s)]
*  It's right in the crack in the roof where you wouldn't, you know, everyone [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=87.68s)]
*  wants to go blind. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=90.8s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=92.4s)]
*  It drives me nuts. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=93.36s)]
*  Tomorrow is going to be like, should we put curtains up there? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=94.36s)]
*  It's like this thing, you and I went to the stadium 15 years ago. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  Like they couldn't figure out the fucking sunlight when it's after daylight savings. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=100.04s)]
*  The P remember Dallas, the TV show that was like in the opening, the light [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  going through the stadium, like, oh wow, that's kind of cool. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  It's like, no, it's not that cool. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=111.56s)]
*  I hate this team. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  I'm really mad. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  And I feel like I get doubled after here because like they don't even change the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=115.0s)]
*  cadence. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=120.72s)]
*  Like Cooper rush is like, here we go. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=121.2s)]
*  And that gets me angry. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=122.96s)]
*  And then I have to see the play and that gets me angry. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=124.32s)]
*  So I'm getting angry like 160 times a game. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=126.88s)]
*  Our dash it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=130.84s)]
*  My next Cowboys question are Dak, lamb and Parsons all on next year's team. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=132.84s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=140.48s)]
*  There's too much money. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=142.16s)]
*  What was, what are they going to do? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=143.08s)]
*  Is Lawrence also on next year's team? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=144.72000000000003s)]
*  Those four, if those four guys next year. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=147.16000000000003s)]
*  I do think so. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=152.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  I just want Aubrey. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=154.32000000000002s)]
*  I need the kicker to stay. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=155.4s)]
*  Listen, if they're not on the team, if they're not not on the team, that means [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=158.52s)]
*  Jerry is going to trade them. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=162.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=163.4s)]
*  And he's been, that he's been awful. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=163.72000000000003s)]
*  I mean, we got, we got Mingo who didn't even suit up for like a four, like you'll [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=166.04000000000002s)]
*  see what they got for Hopkins versus Mingo. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=170.88000000000002s)]
*  And they do it year after year after year. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=173.36s)]
*  It's getting bad. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=175.72000000000003s)]
*  I like the, the, uh, philosophy of. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=177.12s)]
*  Yeah, we got Mingo. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  We really liked him coming out of the draft. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=182.16000000000003s)]
*  It was like, did you still like them when he couldn't play for [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  Carolina for two years? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=187.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=189.08s)]
*  It'd be like if we really liked somebody for the ringer two years ago. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=190.32000000000002s)]
*  And then the person went somewhere and just handed in a bunch of columns late [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=194.20000000000002s)]
*  and did three podcasts that had to be aborted. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=198.56s)]
*  We're like, wow, we really did like them two years ago. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=201.6s)]
*  Let's go get them anyway. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=203.52s)]
*  Maybe change the scene. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=204.56s)]
*  Record labels aren't signing Diddy anytime soon, even though he's went [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=205.4s)]
*  double platinum, um, 15 years ago. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=208.76s)]
*  Is that a bad analogy? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=211.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  I listen, I'm here for all Diddy analogies. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=213.64s)]
*  Um, here's my next question for you. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=215.92s)]
*  Cowboys related. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=218.48s)]
*  I'm going to go through every team in the NFC and you tell me which team [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=219.4s)]
*  you'd rather be then for the next three years. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=223.44s)]
*  This is a dick move. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=226.48s)]
*  It's not a dick move. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=227.6s)]
*  It's an exercise. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=228.6s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=230.56s)]
*  I don't exercise. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=231.24s)]
*  Would you rather be Dallas or Philadelphia next three years? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=232.04s)]
*  That's easy. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=236.64s)]
*  Philly. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=237.28s)]
*  Washington. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=237.6s)]
*  Washington. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=239.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=240.32s)]
*  Would you rather be Dallas or the Giants? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=241.64s)]
*  I'm going to say still Dallas and then I'm going to get kicked [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=245.24s)]
*  into teeth on Thanksgiving and that'll be fun. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=247.64s)]
*  I think Dallas is the right answer for that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=249.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=251.84s)]
*  So you'd rather be base. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=252.12s)]
*  So the Giants, we have one. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=253.04s)]
*  Are we going to really do this 16 times? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=254.4s)]
*  Well, go straight to Minnesota green Bay. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=256.52s)]
*  You'd rather be all those things. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=258.44s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=259.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=260.32s)]
*  Would you rather be Dallas or Chicago? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=260.72s)]
*  Um, I think their front office is just as F'ed up kind of to be honest with you. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=263.64s)]
*  I mean, we would, we were texting off to the side. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=270.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=273.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=273.8s)]
*  So they have to make a coaching change not sold on the quarterback. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=274.08s)]
*  I think that's a push actually. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=277.68s)]
*  Can I say push? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=279.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  We have a push. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=280.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=281.12s)]
*  Would you rather be Dallas or Atlanta? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=281.56s)]
*  I'd rather be Atlanta. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=284.52s)]
*  Atlanta. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=285.56s)]
*  Would you rather be Dallas or Tampa Bay? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=287.12s)]
*  Uh, all right. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=290.64s)]
*  So first thing I'm thinking about is coach quarterback. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=292.44s)]
*  Shit Tampa Bay. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=296.92s)]
*  I think you'd rather have Baker Mayfield. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=298.28000000000003s)]
*  See him today. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ep1mR6jRM&t=299.8s)]
