# Bill Simmons Is Tired of the 1972 Dolphins | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [October 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw)
*  I'm so tired of the 72 dolphins. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=0.0s)]
*  So has anyone ever, ever really dove into the 72 dolphin season? [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=1.74s)]
*  It's only been 50 years. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=7.48s)]
*  What are you tired? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  50 years. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=9.74s)]
*  They, they celebrate every five years. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=10.5s)]
*  They're celebrating it again. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=12.32s)]
*  They celebrate it when, when somebody has an undefeated season that falls through. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=13.48s)]
*  We have to deal with them. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=18.0s)]
*  Nobody's ever dined off a season more than these guys. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=19.46s)]
*  So, um, so I looked at their, at what happened. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=23.06s)]
*  They were 14 and O that year, right? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=26.68s)]
*  14 game season. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=28.46s)]
*  For some reason, the NFL that year had this, it was expansion, right? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=30.62s)]
*  So the AFL and the NFL, they merged. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=36.36s)]
*  So the league's all out of whack. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=38.9s)]
*  It's very similar to when the 96 Bulls won 72 games because there [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=40.42s)]
*  were too many teams in the league. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=44.46s)]
*  For some reason, the East divisions had five teams instead of four. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=46.260000000000005s)]
*  So the dolphins play eight of their 14 games against the jets who [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=51.7s)]
*  finished seven and seven, the Colts five and nine Buffalo four, nine and one. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=55.56s)]
*  And the terrible paths three and 11. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=59.84s)]
*  They also got to play the oilers who are one and 13. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=62.32s)]
*  They played the chargers who are four, nine and one. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=64.94s)]
*  And they played the Cardinals in the other conference who are four, nine and one. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=67.12s)]
*  So 11 of their 14 games were against dog shit teams. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  And I went on this deep dive. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=74.88s)]
*  I sent it to you, the jets in week 10, that Zonka fumbles. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=77.1s)]
*  They call it a fumble after the whistle. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=80.78s)]
*  The game's over. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=82.30000000000001s)]
*  If the jets get the fumble, dolphins punt. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  Guy runs into the punter. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  It's like five seconds after the guy. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=87.68s)]
*  Nobody's ever run into the punter later than this guy runs into the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=89.28s)]
*  punter rolling into them. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=92.16s)]
*  You sent me the video. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=93.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=94.2s)]
*  Keeps the drive alive and the dolphins go. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=94.56s)]
*  And I'm just like, God damn it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=96.84s)]
*  If that, that fucking asshole hadn't run into the punter, we'd never have to deal [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=98.0s)]
*  with like Larry Zonka with the cigar again. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=104.78s)]
*  And then if my team, if my team had pulled off an oh seven, we'd never have to deal [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=106.0s)]
*  with these guys because then it would be like, oh, well, and then somebody else did [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=110.28s)]
*  it, but no, every time. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  Here they are again. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=115.8s)]
*  72 dolphins. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=116.8s)]
*  Listen, let me just say this. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=118.52s)]
*  Fuck this. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=120.52s)]
*  First of all, this might be elder abuse on your part. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=124.08s)]
*  What do you care? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=127.36s)]
*  What do you, what are you going to go back to? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=128.56s)]
*  They kicked the Patriots ass my entire childhood. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=130.16s)]
*  So I just, I don't like the dolphins. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  But here's the other thing. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=133.36s)]
*  What, what if someone does this in 40 years about, uh, about your Patriots and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=134.24s)]
*  looks at it and there's a Bill Simmons is like, Hey, did you realize the best [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=138.12s)]
*  quarterback in the Patriots division for 12 years was Ryan Fitzpatrick? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=142.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=148.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=148.64s)]
*  You can have cases against anything. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=148.76s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=150.68s)]
*  So, but yeah, it does suck. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=151.56s)]
*  I've had enough of it too. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=153.32s)]
*  1972. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=156.64s)]
*  They, for the year that the offense, there's 17 passing touchdowns and 12 [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=158.68s)]
*  interceptions. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=162.84s)]
*  Those are the regular. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=163.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=165.28s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOQ_aLv4xlw&t=166.12s)]
