# Million-Dollar Picks Week 18 With Joe House  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [January 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w)
*  All right million dollar picks week 18, so I don't remember a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=0.0s)]
*  Week 18 or in the old days of week 17 a last week of the season [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=5.78s)]
*  That had this many question marks of who's rolling over and who's not and I don't know why that's this year [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=10.84s)]
*  But we even have playoff teams this year [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=16.44s)]
*  like the Rams where I'm like [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=18.92s)]
*  So they're they're not gonna win like the Seahawks are minus six now favorites and the Rams still have a chance to like lock down [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=22.14s)]
*  a three seed we were asking Peter Schrager about it this week and and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=28.24s)]
*  And he was texting us like just the Rams haven't had a buy since week six [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=32.36s)]
*  They're banged up [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=37.599999999999994s)]
*  McVeigh wanted to give Stafford and the receivers and Kyron Williams a week to heal for the playoffs and [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=39.239999999999995s)]
*  Really likes his backups. So that choice that the Rams have of like if we lock down three, we're probably playing [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=45.72s)]
*  Washington in the three six in LA [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=53.0s)]
*  Or we drop down to four we're playing the loser of Minnesota to trade I [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=56.18s)]
*  Don't know. I really would have wanted to play Washington. No offense to your to your [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=62.14s)]
*  Seawords right I just I would have gone for it, but I get it that team must be really banged up is my takeaway [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=67.42s)]
*  Well, and you we've seen it we keep watching where that last three weeks at Beth has been been dragging they just can't [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=73.1s)]
*  score and you know [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=80.62s)]
*  Shregs included some of the stats for Kyron Williams that dude needs a break give him a rest [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=83.34s)]
*  It is a curious kind of decision out of the Rams except for that's what they do Sean McVeigh has done this before so [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=89.66000000000001s)]
*  You know the end whichever of the teams between Detroit and Minnesota that they get will indeed be banged up [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=96.7s)]
*  It will I mean just in terms of battle scars from the game [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=103.22s)]
*  This coming Sunday night that that will decide the one seed in the NFC the real stakes [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=106.98s)]
*  Like it's like it's awesome. If you win you don't get to play for a week if you lose [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=113.30000000000001s)]
*  All of a sudden you're traveling somewhere in five or six days and playing around one playoff game. So yeah [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=118.62s)]
*  Well it ties into what we think will happen with that Detroit Minnesota game which we'll get to in a second [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=126.06s)]
*  But I was looking at Rams plus six and a half against Seattle [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=130.56s)]
*  like [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=134.5s)]
*  Maybe maybe they hang I don't really know what Seattle's motivation is because they're out [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=135.82s)]
*  Well, there's some [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=141.42s)]
*  Geno Smith motivation. He's one of those guys with a bunch of incentives. Yeah, he's 186 yards. There's a basket of [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=143.34s)]
*  Achievements for him that'll get him an extra three million bucks this year [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=151.62s)]
*  So and I think the team will know that understand it Mike McDonald is motivated to beat McVeigh in his first season [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=155.7s)]
*  They lost in overtime. Yes, Seattle. So I think there's plenty of motivation for Seattle. I'm just not laying six and a half [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=162.9s)]
*  No, because unless the Rams the way that the rosters work right now [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=170.62s)]
*  They have to play some of their good guys on defense [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=176.34s)]
*  They can't sit their entire defense and the defense has been the thing that that that's kept them the defense propelled them into the playoffs [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=179.18s)]
*  The way that the defense played over this past month [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=186.3s)]
*  They saved the game against the Cardinals on Saturday with an interception in the end zone, right? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=188.66s)]
*  I mean, you know, the defense is the key [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=195.42000000000002s)]
*  So I think and Seattle's offense has been fits and starts now I there is a difference for Seattle [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=197.58s)]
*  Their splits when they play on turf and domes is they've been very good [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=204.66s)]
*  There's only been a handful of those games this year, but they've scored [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=209.1s)]
*  Prolifically, so that would be part of why you might be concerned [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=212.1s)]
*  They can win by margin if the Rams like, you know start pulling guys, but I like the Rams to be live here [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=215.42s)]
*  Rams money line with the over 38 and a half is plus 438 [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=223.57999999999998s)]
*  It's fun, it's fun Rams plus six and a half [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=229.9s)]
*  tees [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=235.94s)]
*  In a four-point tease on Fandel up to ten and a half with the Chiefs [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=237.54s)]
*  Fourteen and a half. Oh [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=243.26s)]
*  And you could and that's plus 110 on Fandel if you want to talk yourself into [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=245.33999999999997s)]
*  Chiefs and Rams not probably gonna roll over in these games. So that's that's it there for us quickly and the Chiefs [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=250.94s)]
*  I just I'd be really scared of taking the other side in this game. I could see the Chiefs winning [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=261.5s)]
*  I don't think once is gonna be that bad [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=266.82s)]
*  I wouldn't lay the ten and a half and I'll be glad to grab the 14 and a half if that's what you're offering me [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=268.5s)]
*  In this in this four point tease that the Chiefs are not an F around team. They have been in this [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=273.82s)]
*  circumstance four times over the last sort of five six years or so and [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=280.78s)]
*  They tend to cover and they tend to win outright [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=286.34s)]
*  I think they're they've covered the out of the four of these situations and they've won outright at least a couple times [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=289.58s)]
*  They are not to be trifled with and and this is [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=295.78000000000003s)]
*  Still yet Denver on a losing streak with their rookie quarterback in his highest leverage game of his entire career [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=298.82000000000005s)]
*  And he's capable of throwing some picks [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=307.66s)]
*  I mean I bet the Chiefs calling card has been their defense all season long now their secondary is vulnerable [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=310.1s)]
*  But let's let's you know [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=317.18s)]
*  Before we get super excited about Bo Nicks in a must-win playoff kind of situation [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=319.46000000000004s)]
*  I mean ten and a half come on [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=324.78s)]
*  Yeah, it almost seems like maybe [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=327.82s)]
*  There's two ways to play it. We could just do [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=330.94s)]
*  Smaller bets on the Chiefs plus ten and a half and the Rams plus six and a half and assume you're gonna split those [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=333.65999999999997s)]
*  And maybe win both you could tease them together with the little four point tease plus ten and a half plus six and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=338.65999999999997s)]
*  Plus ten and a half to plus fourteen and a half plus six and a half plus ten and a half or [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=344.7s)]
*  You have some fun do Chiefs money over thirty nine and a half. That's plus seven forty four [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=349.34s)]
*  Unfanded Rams money over thirty eight now plus four thirty eight just put small ones on both and hope one of them hits [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=354.78s)]
*  And we'll have an answer for you at the end of million dollar picks [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=362.14s)]
*  Two games I want to bet on [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=366.58s)]
*  I want to bet against the Pats and I want to bet against the Titans and here's why the lines are crazy low bills are favored [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=370.38s)]
*  minus two and a half over the Pats [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=377.29999999999995s)]
*  Texans are favored minus one and a half at the Titans [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=379.5s)]
*  I have no idea why the Pats or Titans would want to win this game and [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=384.78s)]
*  You can go back to the Giants game last week and say well you would have said that about the Giants I [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=390.17999999999995s)]
*  Watched that entire Giants game [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=395.41999999999996s)]
*  It was a complete fluke II collapsed by Indianapolis combined with drew lock just had a really good game [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=397.85999999999996s)]
*  And if you drew lock, why wouldn't you want to have a good game? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=404.14s)]
*  You're like trying to you know prove that you could be a starting quarterback next year [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=406.73999999999995s)]
*  That game just kind of fell away from the Colts it was a coaching abomination [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=410.58000000000004s)]
*  There was a special teams touchdown. There are all these specific reasons [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=416.34000000000003s)]
*  Bill's Pats like it's and I'm gonna talk to my dad later in the pot about why Drake mays playing just what's how how [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=420.3s)]
*  Just awful this past season's been I [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=426.86s)]
*  Can't believe that they would just give away the number one pick in the last week of the season is Drake may really playing [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=429.66s)]
*  Are they just saying that maybe he plays one quarter and [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=435.58000000000004s)]
*  Leaves or I just makes no sense whatsoever [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=439.18s)]
*  None the only person that it makes sense for is Gerard Mayo [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=443.46000000000004s)]
*  Well, so this is a problem fucking football team [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=447.46000000000004s)]
*  But this is the problem if he if the coach and everybody knew they were coming back next year [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=449.98s)]
*  This is where we go. We're gonna start Joe Milton [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=455.1s)]
*  We want to take a look for him Adam in week 18 and we're gonna try some other guys [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=457.58000000000004s)]
*  We're sick and saw us if you don't know you're coming back [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=461.26000000000005s)]
*  You kind of want to win you want to end the game in a high note [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=464.78000000000003s)]
*  You want to end the game in a high note, you don't want somebody to say hey you guys look like shit the last couple weeks of [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=467.3s)]
*  The season yeah, because I benched my quarterback motherfucker [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=472.26s)]
*  That's why teen a week 18 win over the bills who said everybody is really gonna change the out the career trajectory of Gerard Mayo [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=475.42s)]
*  He's he's stunk all season long. We've had 17 games of evidence [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=483.21999999999997s)]
*  Like, you know the paths to be fair are exactly where they should be. It's where the market anticipated [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=487.86s)]
*  Why there yeah, they had the lowest forecasted win total of the year and here we are [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=494.34000000000003s)]
*  Congratulations on getting it done [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=500.1s)]
*  But like the twists and turns have been bizarre and it does make you wonder who is in charge [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=501.38s)]
*  And I think this coming Sunday game we the crafts better step in whoever the what's the GM's name Van Pelt? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=507.02000000000004s)]
*  Is that the guy know that he's the OC the GM is is the interim GM is Elliott Wolf who would ever [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=514.3s)]
*  After Drake may put together one of the worst drafts in the history of the NFL [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=520.3000000000001s)]
*  No, you have to lose the game and and it's indefensible because [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=525.1s)]
*  If they get the first pick they're gonna be able to trade back [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=529.5400000000001s)]
*  Even if they trade back three spots to number four and get more picks [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=532.38s)]
*  You're just basically giving away players and you're not gonna take a quarterback at the top. Anyway, there's no defense [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=537.0s)]
*  It's it's long-term leverage. It's franchise altering leverage and and you know when you when you weigh [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=542.22s)]
*  The risk when you weigh the cost benefit of a week 18 win versus the trajectory for your effing franchise going [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=549.82s)]
*  Yeah [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=557.74s)]
*  You have the cornerstone quarterback the thing that you need to do now is get other good players on the effing football team [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=557.9000000000001s)]
*  And the only way to do that the fastest way to do that is by doing the thing you're sitting and looking at right this second [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=564.98s)]
*  Which is to lose the mother-effing game and get as much as you can in terms of capital [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=571.46s)]
*  This is like very basic business building proposition shit right here [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=576.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we only have two good players and good's always had a concussion last week [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=580.7199999999999s)]
*  So he shouldn't play May's been banged up took a big shot last week [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=584.64s)]
*  You sit those two guys and say they just don't have enough talent to beat even the bills second string. So I [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=588.0s)]
*  like the bills minus two and a half and [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=593.9599999999999s)]
*  I really like the Texans minus one half against the Titans. I think the Titans are terrible [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=596.9599999999999s)]
*  The stretch that they've just been on recently is is just a roller coaster ride of shit and [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=601.68s)]
*  You know the Texans have lost their last two [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=609.84s)]
*  Right there. They've locked up the four seed for a while, but they kind of need to play well for a game [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=612.84s)]
*  It's that you could say like oh they don't need the game they're already in it's like now they kind of need to look good [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=619.76s)]
*  for three hours and I [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=624.84s)]
*  Just find it hard to believe they're gonna toss away the game and go into the playoffs finishing nine and eight for the season [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=627.44s)]
*  Hosting somebody good either the charges of the Steelers and [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=635.76s)]
*  Just not feel good about anything that's happened for a month. I totally agree [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=639.84s)]
*  I want to bet both of these and I think we split at least one if the Pats and Titans both win [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=644.6800000000001s)]
*  That means the Browns are gonna have the first pick in the draft [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=651.08s)]
*  When the things ever work out for the Browns [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=654.48s)]
*  Oh, I feel bad ever. Sorry for the fans. You know, it's true. Yeah, I mean [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=657.4399999999999s)]
*  Cleveland writ large did get LeBron so we can't you know, Cleveland's had some some good [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=662.56s)]
*  Three years ago and he left I'm just saying sir, but you know, he brought him a title over the last three years [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=668.52s)]
*  We don't have to say that Cleveland's you know, but then they got the Kyrie [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=673.88s)]
*  They got that they won the Kyrie lottery because the league felt bad for them [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=677.52s)]
*  That's one of my top five are we sure this was [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=681.28s)]
*  The guys on the action network they call the [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=688.3199999999999s)]
*  Titans the point shavers. Yeah, which I think is fantastic and I totally agree with what are they two and fourteen against the spread? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=691.3599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yes the worst they they have locked in the worst they can they've already done [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=697.64s)]
*  They're already at the worst [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=703.16s)]
*  But if they lose this one where I spread as well, then they are the historically the worst against the spread in the history of the [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=704.52s)]
*  NFL. Yeah, and the thing is [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=710.28s)]
*  They're their quarterback suck. I just don't see it. I think they're terrible. They're there. They lost to Jacksonville last week [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=712.72s)]
*  They're they got swept by Jacksonville. It's an organizational disaster. I couldn't believe with my own eyes [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=719.8399999999999s)]
*  I had gambled on them when they came to Washington and they had just beaten Houston and [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=725.36s)]
*  Washington was laying six and a half and I was like, oh that's again the Titans at that point has some [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=730.16s)]
*  Advanced analytics that said their defense was good. They are they're they suck the high heaven [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=734.68s)]
*  I think Washington had 200 yards rushing in the first half. They were there abysmal [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=740.18s)]
*  Organizationally, so yeah, really that let's go easy to go against the Titans. All right [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=745.14s)]
*  So we'll put Pat we'll put stuff against the Pats and Titans [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=749.5s)]
*  The two big games I want to focus on and there's so many games where it's like [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=753.5799999999999s)]
*  I don't know if that team's gonna care. I don't know if this team's gonna care [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=757.52s)]
*  I don't know who's playing I don't know what the motivation is [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=760.12s)]
*  But we know Vikings Lions and Steelers Bengals [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=762.38s)]
*  We know that all four of those teams are gonna give a shit about the game [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=765.06s)]
*  Steelers Bengals everybody's on the Bengals it feels like [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=769.4399999999999s)]
*  the line is [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=772.88s)]
*  Bengals minus one and a half in Pittsburgh [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=774.9599999999999s)]
*  The Bengals are eight and eight for the year [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=778.3599999999999s)]
*  The Bengals have really no good wins last week's win was probably the best win. They've had of the season [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=781.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't think their defense is good bone next missed multiple wide open guys and like he hit one but he missed [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=788.04s)]
*  Three others I thought the Broncos should have won the game. I know burrows really good [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=794.48s)]
*  I know burrow with Chase and Higgins are really good together Chase Brown [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=799.48s)]
*  Ankle injury, they're not gonna be able to run the ball the same [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=804.4399999999999s)]
*  But to me, this is a Steelers moment. I [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=807.7199999999999s)]
*  Think they need the game if they win there the five seed if they're the five seed they get to go to Houston [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=811.04s)]
*  And play a Houston team that none of us think are good. They should beat the Houston team [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=817.4s)]
*  They beat that Houston team [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=821.92s)]
*  assuming the rest of the [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=824.24s)]
*  Playoffs goes chalk for round one, then they would go to Kansas City for round two [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=826.24s)]
*  Kansas City coming off, you know, God only knows what they do this week by week next week [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=831.02s)]
*  Pittsburgh's gonna go into Kansas City. But yeah, we can play with these dudes. I [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=836.12s)]
*  Don't really like what I've seen from Pittsburgh the last few weeks and I know you don't either but they also had this crazy [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=839.7199999999999s)]
*  three games and 11 days stretch against three of the five best teams in the league and [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=844.92s)]
*  Now I think their stocks too low [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=849.24s)]
*  we've been at the craps table house with the steward steward's a lot and [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=852.0s)]
*  We stayed a little too long in that Philly game. We got our ass kicked [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=857.56s)]
*  I'm ready to put some money and some some dice and some chips down on the craps table and the Steelers again [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=860.92s)]
*  I think they're gonna win. Yeah, you and I are seeing this exactly eye to eye and I think we it's important to [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=866.24s)]
*  continue to emphasize [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=872.48s)]
*  That the perception of the Steelers because of this three game stretch this three game slide which was always [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=874.16s)]
*  circled in bright red as being an impossible task at the end of a season going up against the three best teams in the NFL by [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=881.6s)]
*  You know a lot of ways you want to assess it. Yes Detroit and Minnesota [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=890.12s)]
*  but rest this is with without their best receiver an [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=894.52s)]
*  offense that needs that receiver that needs that over-the-top [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=898.6s)]
*  Option and the perception of of who the Bengals have become because they had a luck win [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=902.6800000000001s)]
*  Against the Cowboys a special teams luck win against the Cowboys [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=910.48s)]
*  And then they beat the Titans and then they beat the Browns and then they held on [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=913.84s)]
*  Against the Broncos at home and what was for them a playoff game because if they lost there was no playoff possibility [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=918.72s)]
*  Whatsoever it was not exactly a cover in glory [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=926.0400000000001s)]
*  Moment for the Bengals that their defense absolutely positively was right there trying to give up that game [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=929.64s)]
*  And well think about the special teams piece too like that. I'm a I don't trust their kicker at all [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=936.08s)]
*  This is no way three-point [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=941.76s)]
*  This is gonna be a classic Steelers Pittsburgh Tomlin game and the Steelers have Boswell and these guys have a kicker that I don't [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=943.52s)]
*  Trust from any distance basically absolutely positively right and remember that the Bengals last loss was to the Steelers [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=950.66s)]
*  In Cincinnati where the Steelers had five hundred and thirty yards of offense. I think they have it dialed [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=958.3199999999999s)]
*  I think they understand how to exploit this the Cincinnati [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=964.7199999999999s)]
*  Defense and it feels like a tremendous opportunity to grab the Steelers here getting points at home. It's like classic [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=968.8s)]
*  Tomlin moment so disrespectful Steelers with some rest ten days between Wednesday and this Saturday, so they're able to heal [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=975.88s)]
*  I [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=983.92s)]
*  Love this. This is a classic [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=985.92s)]
*  Classic Tomlin look if they lose at Borough kills them. I'm not gonna regret betting on the Steelers [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=988.68s)]
*  I feel the same way I'll take it. They have come through over and over again in this spot at home [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=994.24s)]
*  We've seen it too many times and [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=998.9399999999999s)]
*  And I think there's real stakes for them. That's the piece [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1001.4s)]
*  The Rams I get it like it's like okay [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1004.64s)]
*  Either we're gonna be hosting Washington in the three six [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1007.5999999999999s)]
*  Or we're hosting probably the Lions coming off a really physical brutal playoff game in the four five [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1011.34s)]
*  It matters, but it doesn't really a hundred percent matter this Steelers thing matters the difference thing [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1018.02s)]
*  Playing Houston in Houston versus going to fucking Baltimore and playing Baltimore for the third time [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1023.54s)]
*  This really matters to them and I don't think that I think the Bengals are eight and eight for a reason [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1030.58s)]
*  I agree like, you know T Higgins missed a few weeks, right? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1035.2s)]
*  Other than that, this is who they are. They have a couple good players and a lot of shitty ones [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1039.08s)]
*  It's the defense the defense has been bad all season [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1043.76s)]
*  You can't count on that defense the defense doesn't get stops when they need to that's not who this team is [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1046.6s)]
*  So do you like the Steelers plus one and a half or do you just like the Steelers plus 110? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1051.24s)]
*  I like that money line [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1057.76s)]
*  Yeah, the plus things are gonna win. So it's a little more appetizer. Yeah, okay [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1059.76s)]
*  And then the other one is Vikings Lions and I feel like now every Thursday I'm just [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1065.0s)]
*  Talking about the Vikings how I don't understand why people don't realize they're good [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1071.6s)]
*  They came through again last week and the best possible thing happened in that game last week [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1075.24s)]
*  They dominated their kicker missed a couple field goals [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1080.84s)]
*  The Packers really got it going with eight minutes left when the Vikings were way up [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1085.48s)]
*  They stopped blitzing as much and doing some of the stuff that got them to the spot there in the first three quarters laid [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1090.7s)]
*  Back a little bit love started to look good and all of a sudden it was you know [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1096.1200000000001s)]
*  A two-point game as the final score. It was not a two-point game. The Vikings are awesome [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1100.1200000000001s)]
*  That's been the tale for the Vikings all season long. You look at their resume [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1105.5s)]
*  You're gonna see a slew of one score games [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1109.7s)]
*  They are one score games because they were beating the crap out of teams and then teams came back on them [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1111.9s)]
*  I mean Jordan loved these nuts did it twice he came back, you know and made the game and we thought of a once one score game [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1117.42s)]
*  And you know, this was very quick aside Jordan loved these nuts. They need to handle their business against Chicago [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1125.0200000000002s)]
*  Because I think Washington this game will be going on simultaneously. I like Washington, but Washington Dallas is always [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1131.7800000000002s)]
*  Oh, it's a walker. Yes. You do not like say, oh, yeah, Washington should walk over [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1138.6200000000001s)]
*  So I think and and the the Packers need to like, you know show something they got their ass beat [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1144.46s)]
*  That was a physical they got out physicaled. They're their [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1150.3400000000001s)]
*  Defensive line got out physicaled by the Minnesota front [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1153.8600000000001s)]
*  So Jordan loved these nuts and the Packers better show up and show out but for the for the Vikings [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1157.8600000000001s)]
*  I [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1164.14s)]
*  Have one way that I want to play this and yes [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1165.2600000000002s)]
*  I really I'm not convinced to move too far beyond the way that I want to play it. What's here? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1168.22s)]
*  Love them as a teaser leg [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1174.66s)]
*  I think it's an incredible teaser leg taking them as two and a half point dogs and pushing them up to eight and a half [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1176.14s)]
*  That the Lions are not in in any kind of way shape or form in a position [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1182.5800000000002s)]
*  To win by margin and they can't win by margin because they're to protect the lead when they're up by 14 in the fourth quarter [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1187.42s)]
*  Do it? Yeah, and I respected the Lions so much [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1193.38s)]
*  But look they could have and should have lost that game against San Francisco [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1196.4s)]
*  I mean the Niners had a million chances. Yeah missed field goals pretty [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1200.86s)]
*  Overthrowing guys both of his interceptions to Kirby were grotesque [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1206.82s)]
*  Overthrows they were both directly on Brock Bird and he got hurt at the end. Yeah, so I mean and [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1211.34s)]
*  So I don't think Minnesota is going to aid and abet its own demise the way that the Niners did [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1218.1799999999998s)]
*  But this game to me is like, you know razor-thin [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1225.34s)]
*  I have tons of respect for the Vikings and everything they've done [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1228.48s)]
*  This is like for it's such a good matchup Dan Campbell and and KOC like a [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1233.2s)]
*  Really good coaching matchup and you know home team that the line seems right to me two and a half seems seems fair [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1239.56s)]
*  I just love the idea of the Vikings getting more than a touchdown. I [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1246.3999999999999s)]
*  Think the Vikings are gonna win and I want to bet on that piece of it [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1252.3999999999999s)]
*  That's my only but I also want to put them in a tease because I agree with you like there's stuff we could do [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1255.4s)]
*  We could do Pittsburgh plus four and a half and Minnesota plus seven and a half. That's plus 112 great one. We could do [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1260.44s)]
*  Washington minus 220 just to win with Minnesota plus seven and a half. That's around even odds. We can do that as well [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1266.92s)]
*  Those would be my my two I I don't want Washington [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1276.56s)]
*  You were nervous about this watch yes, yes [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1280.6s)]
*  I was nervous about the game what they did against the Eagles that come back against a division rival [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1283.64s)]
*  And everything they put out and then for them to bounce back and and show up and take care of business against the Falcons [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1291.04s)]
*  Again in the most dramatic fashion [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1297.24s)]
*  Possible at some point like the cumulative effect of that. This is a storybook season for Washington [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1299.76s)]
*  They they lead the league in come from behind victories they lead the league in terms of scoring inside the last minute [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1305.44s)]
*  They lead the league in fourth down conversions like there's a whole bunch of stuff [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1312.0400000000002s)]
*  It would be a rightful capper for this Washington team to beat Dallas in week 18 [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1316.3600000000001s)]
*  Push themselves into the the sixth seed like that is a absolute [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1323.0s)]
*  unbelievable miracle for the franchise, but man the last 25 years [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1329.2800000000002s)]
*  You must take recognition and take note. That's all see rooting for Trey Lance. I am definitely not under no circumstances [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1335.16s)]
*  I hate Dallas. I'm not I'm saying you're rooting for Trey Lance to be named starter [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1342.64s)]
*  Oh, he starts that helps your rush because he's not a he's not a professional quarterback. He is not oh, thank God [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1346.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, if he's the quarterback, I'm really rooting for him [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1352.16s)]
*  so it sounds like [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1355.2800000000002s)]
*  We should put Vikings plus 130 and Steelers plus 110 [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1357.44s)]
*  We should just bet those and then I do a tease [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1361.3999999999999s)]
*  maybe with I [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1365.8799999999999s)]
*  Mean the other way to do it is just do the tease and make that the big bet [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1368.1999999999998s)]
*  I like the tease better because I do think the resourcefulness of Detroit and [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1371.6999999999998s)]
*  They're incredible backbone over the course of this entire season even in the face of all that bad injury luck [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1377.76s)]
*  They just keep coming out. I love so much the Campbell's no Montgomery, too [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1384.04s)]
*  Yeah, I know I mean I just look it's it's just they're decimated it's a bummer I hate it [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1388.0s)]
*  I hate the injury luck for them, but they're badasses [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1393.5200000000002s)]
*  I just my only fear is I don't want to look like if if one of these two teams screws up somehow [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1396.3200000000002s)]
*  And then we lose both games [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1402.2800000000002s)]
*  That's my fear because that happened last week because I love Minnesota last week and you threw some water on it [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1404.3200000000002s)]
*  You scared me off a little and we ended up putting them in a parlay [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1409.8400000000001s)]
*  With the Colts and the Colts lost and then I just I won nothing on Minnesota even though that was one of my favorite bets [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1412.8799999999999s)]
*  So I understand [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1419.52s)]
*  Just do the Viking Steelers money lines and then maybe we do that [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1423.8s)]
*  I mean you're saying individually just play the separate money line. Yeah [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1428.8s)]
*  Separate money lines. No, not partly. Okay, fine. Great. I get what you're saying and then do the tease together [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1433.8799999999999s)]
*  Okay, oh I love that because the teaser like for the Steelers is tremendous as well [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1439.44s)]
*  Yeah, one and a half up to seven and a half. Love that. I think that's the move [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1444.68s)]
*  Okay, so we do Vikings money line Steelers money line Pittsburgh with the little tease and then Bill's Texan stuff [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1451.0s)]
*  And you want to put anything on cheese rams or no? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1459.48s)]
*  If you want to do that, let that four-point tease I kind of loved it [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1462.8799999999999s)]
*  All right, and do you agree that we should probably scale back this week? Yeah. Oh my god [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1466.56s)]
*  Don't yeah don't bet anything meaningful. We pulled everything out of our ass last week [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1471.22s)]
*  The only thing that was a step back in any way shape or form was the stupid Colts. I [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1475.6399999999999s)]
*  Know but you know what we should have known better [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1480.24s)]
*  We should know not to put they were they were seven-point favorites [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1482.48s)]
*  Yeah, and had no business being seven-point favorites over anybody and that was a rare like we got suckered in on a bad team [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1487.2s)]
*  Basically just assuming the Giants would take care of business and it was just a classic Colts are an absolute [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1495.36s)]
*  Absolute everybody needs to go situation [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1502.24s)]
*  Hilariously [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1507.24s)]
*  Atlanta is in the exact same spot right now [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1508.68s)]
*  Atlanta is laying seven and a half just the exact same way the Colts were laying seven and a half [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1510.92s)]
*  Atlanta's laying seven and a half take to Carolina [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1515.36s)]
*  You know who's been spunky? I'm doing that. I'm doing from the NFC Seth. Okay, good [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1518.6s)]
*  All right [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1525.04s)]
*  million dollar picks [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1526.92s)]
*  Week 18 last week we won [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1528.84s)]
*  $641,000 pretty good. We're up two point one seven seven million dollars [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1532.44s)]
*  For the year and we're not we're gonna scale back this week [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1538.24s)]
*  Smart because it's week 18. It's a stupid week [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1543.12s)]
*  I want to have a nice little two million dollar nest egg for the playoffs the playoffs, baby [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1546.36s)]
*  Yeah, I don't want to I don't want to be like [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1550.8s)]
*  What we do I don't want to be at the blackjack table of 20 minutes too long after they change the dealers [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1553.3200000000002s)]
*  Let's just take it nice and easy [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1558.4s)]
*  Maybe we throw away the money line bets and just do Pittsburgh, Minnesota as the teas that we find [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1560.4s)]
*  But fine, it's one of my favorite bets of the week. All right [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1565.24s)]
*  All right first bet [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1569.3200000000002s)]
*  Pittsburgh [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1572.88s)]
*  We're gonna do a slight adjusted parlay with them plus four and a half Pittsburgh against Cincinnati with Minnesota plus seven half against the trait [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1574.1200000000001s)]
*  That is plus one twelve on [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1582.96s)]
*  Fandle and the reasoning for this [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1586.1200000000001s)]
*  We don't think Pittsburgh is being judged correctly after their horrible three games in 11 days stretch [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1589.64s)]
*  They are now 10 days rest against a team that they put 500 plus yards on [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1595.0s)]
*  Their home their underdogs. This is the all-time classic Tomlin situation and then Minnesota plus seven half [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1600.2s)]
*  I think we both think they're better than Detroit [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1607.72s)]
*  But this gives us some buffer if anything weird happens [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1611.04s)]
*  Yeah, even if they're down ten or fourteen late, they're gonna get the cheap touchdown because Detroit stinks. So that's plus 112 [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1614.8s)]
*  We'll put it. We'll put 150 K on that. Okay, just to respect ourselves there fair fair and then I want to put 50 K [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1622.8s)]
*  each on [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1631.8799999999999s)]
*  Vikings plus 130 and Steelers plus 110 great no argument [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1633.96s)]
*  All right, then we are gonna put a hundred K on [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1639.76s)]
*  Two teams against two teams that should not want to win this weekend the Patriots and the Titans [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1643.9599999999998s)]
*  So bills minus two and a half hundred K and that over the Pats good the Pats win [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1650.0s)]
*  I'm gonna lose my mind. I'm just telling you right now. Just don't just mute me on Twitter. Just do it do it now [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1656.28s)]
*  I'm gonna fucking lose my mind. Don't watch the Sunday podcast. I'm gonna lose my mind if they win this game [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1662.7199999999998s)]
*  Texans might have a half [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1668.6399999999999s)]
*  Texans minus one and a half over the Titans. That's the point shavers. Yes the point [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1673.52s)]
*  The Titans Texans over the point shavers, let's go for two and 15. It gets to spread this season, which is [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1678.48s)]
*  You're just gonna bet against them every week. You'd be up a kajillion dollars that could have been [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1685.44s)]
*  Yeah, right a kajillion dollar. So we're putting a hundred K each on that and [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1690.48s)]
*  Then last but not least just a little 50k flyer on [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1695.64s)]
*  Chiefs plus 14 and a half adjusted with Rams plus 10 and a half that is plus 110 [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1701.16s)]
*  Unfando we just feel like the Chiefs are gonna hang around and make the Denver fans nervous [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1707.72s)]
*  And I think the Rams are gonna hang around [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1713.12s)]
*  Because I don't think McVeigh is a I just want to throw a game away guy. I think he's a let me see [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1716.44s)]
*  Let me see what we have a Blake quorum [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1722.3600000000001s)]
*  What Jimmy G what's what do I got here? He trusts Jimmy G. Yeah, what do I got with my third and fourth receivers? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1725.68s)]
*  Maybe I'll run some trick shit [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1732.1200000000001s)]
*  I just think he'll I think I'll have some fun in this game and get the team ready. So 50k on that and [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1733.68s)]
*  Those are the million dollar picks for week 18. There's one more stake for this house [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1740.56s)]
*  heading into the weekend I [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1746.6000000000001s)]
*  Need a Houston win and I need an Arizona win and I finish [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1749.3999999999999s)]
*  Future over unders that's how I did before the season. I'll be 27 and 5 [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1755.6s)]
*  Right now I'm 25 and 5 Houston win they go over Arizona win. They go over [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEIeGXQ-_w&t=1760.8799999999999s)]
