# Round 1 NFL Reactions and More With Cousin Sal  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU)
*  Definitely the worst week either of us have had [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=0.0s)]
*  since we moved to LA. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3.04s)]
*  And we're gonna talk about all the awful [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4.0600000000000005s)]
*  California stuff later. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=5.92s)]
*  We'll start with football and then we'll circle back [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=7.04s)]
*  around because there's a lot to cover on that. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=9.540000000000001s)]
*  But we wanted to hit the football first, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=12.08s)]
*  as weird as that sounds, Sal. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=15.22s)]
*  We had four really lousy games and then a really good one. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=16.48s)]
*  Tampa, Washington. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=21.6s)]
*  Washington was their first playoff game in 20 years [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=22.6s)]
*  and it ends up being a doink that puts it over the top. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  That did not make up for the other four games [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=29.06s)]
*  from an entertainment standpoint. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=30.979999999999997s)]
*  But really entertaining. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=32.4s)]
*  I'm wondering, is Washington this season, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=34.019999999999996s)]
*  they're not the best team but they're the, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=36.54s)]
*  kind of the Daniel Bryan, Brett Hitman heart. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=38.739999999999995s)]
*  Like you always have a good match when you're in a match [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=42.82s)]
*  with Washington, they're one of those teams. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=45.62s)]
*  They're not gonna win the title but they've been [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=47.22s)]
*  the most fun team this season, right? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=49.34s)]
*  They've been in the most fun games. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=51.06s)]
*  Not so fast, Bill, with them not winning the title. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=51.9s)]
*  Jaden Daniels' face is bleeding. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=55.099999999999994s)]
*  I just wanna lick that blood right off of him. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=57.74s)]
*  No, that's, good for Joe House. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=60.58s)]
*  Yeah, like you said, somber week, shitty week. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=63.34s)]
*  But I feel good for Joe House. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=66.3s)]
*  One of our fricking teams is going and advancing [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=68.1s)]
*  but he was awesome, Jaden Daniels. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=70.94s)]
*  He was really, I mean, they were coming after him. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=72.98s)]
*  For that guy to not turn the ball over once [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=75.94s)]
*  with the heat he was facing and just big play after big play, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=78.46000000000001s)]
*  good for him and good for us from finally getting [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=81.78s)]
*  a good game 36 hours later. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=83.46000000000001s)]
*  Joe House did not have the cojones to actually [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=85.74s)]
*  take Washington in the Ringer Sunday pregame show. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=88.42s)]
*  He did, what did he do, some bogus, Tampa over, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=91.53999999999999s)]
*  it was his way of covering his bases. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=94.41999999999999s)]
*  Tampa over 27 and a half points and he said [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=96.17999999999999s)]
*  Washington would win 28-27. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=98.61999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he was really threading the needle there. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=100.33999999999999s)]
*  I think the Washington fans were believing that [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=102.3s)]
*  they actually had a real chance to win this one [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=104.53999999999999s)]
*  and the line reflected it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=107.02s)]
*  It was Tampa by three but this came down [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=108.02s)]
*  in a couple plays for me. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=111.02s)]
*  So, Washington, they're down four [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=112.7s)]
*  and Tampa gets the goal line stand, right? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=116.54s)]
*  And it goes to fourth and five, there's like, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=119.42s)]
*  I don't know, less than 10 minutes left [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=122.26s)]
*  and I always think the team should kick the field goal, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=125.06s)]
*  take the points, make it a one point game. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=128.02s)]
*  Tampa doesn't do it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=129.9s)]
*  Fourth and five's a lot when you're inside the 10. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=131.34s)]
*  I just didn't trust that they were gonna get it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=133.54000000000002s)]
*  I thought it was a mistake. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=135.26s)]
*  Tampa gets the big stop. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=136.54000000000002s)]
*  They have the momentum going the other way. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=138.26s)]
*  Fumble. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=140.54000000000002s)]
*  Now we're going back again. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=141.98s)]
*  Now it's fourth and two. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=143.34s)]
*  Fourth and, and it was like on the 11. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=145.85999999999999s)]
*  Fourth and two, a little more manageable. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=147.57999999999998s)]
*  I was okay with them going in second time. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=149.38s)]
*  Plus there was less time in the game [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=150.85999999999999s)]
*  and Daniels delivers, comes through, right? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=152.17999999999998s)]
*  So now, Washington's up three. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=154.57999999999998s)]
*  Tampa goes all the way back down. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=156.54s)]
*  They have this great drive. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=158.26s)]
*  Baker has a scramble. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=159.33999999999997s)]
*  It's second and one on the 11 [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=161.06s)]
*  and there's like less than five minutes left. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=163.5s)]
*  They run this like QB option run with Baker, gets stuffed. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=165.5s)]
*  Then the next play, like fumbled snap, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=169.06s)]
*  Bucky Irving always tackled four yards behind the line. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=170.98s)]
*  All of a sudden they're kicking a field goal. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=173.66s)]
*  And it was like, it just like tush push it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=175.89999999999998s)]
*  You have first down, first down goal to go [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=178.54s)]
*  and you have a chance to control your destiny. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=180.38s)]
*  Then Washington comes back down. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=182.5s)]
*  Two huge plays. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=184.14s)]
*  That little weird screen class flick play [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=184.98s)]
*  that Daniels made. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=187.57999999999998s)]
*  That almost could have been intercepted. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=188.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=189.38s)]
*  Yeah, but it was a really nice play. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=190.22s)]
*  They get it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=191.7s)]
*  They go down in a field goal territory. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=192.54s)]
*  Then that awesome third and one by Daniels, which is, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=194.06s)]
*  that was the play of the game. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=196.85999999999999s)]
*  That's why he's special. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=198.42s)]
*  But Sal, like over and over again in the last like five, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=200.02s)]
*  six, seven minutes of these games, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=203.02s)]
*  he's just pulling them out. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=205.14000000000001s)]
*  I'd be scared of them if I was Philadelphia. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=206.34s)]
*  I'd be scared of anyone if I was Philadelphia [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=209.46s)]
*  if the plan was to play like they did today. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=211.58s)]
*  But they're not playing Philadelphia, right? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=214.06s)]
*  They're playing Detroit. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=216.54000000000002s)]
*  No, and I got all excited. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=217.78s)]
*  I actually looked this up. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=219.06s)]
*  Cause I thought it was Washington, Philadelphia [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=221.02s)]
*  before I realized I was confused by the standings. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=222.70000000000002s)]
*  Do you know how many times Washington and Philadelphia [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=225.18s)]
*  played in the playoffs? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=227.10000000000002s)]
*  Has it not happened a lot? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=230.3s)]
*  I'll say four. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=231.5s)]
*  One. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=232.98000000000002s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=234.26000000000002s)]
*  One. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=235.26000000000002s)]
*  It was the Mark Rippon year. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=236.10000000000002s)]
*  Washington beat them 20 to six. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=238.5s)]
*  The one they won the Super Bowl. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=240.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=242.18s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=243.02s)]
*  That was the only time they've ever played in the playoffs, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=243.86s)]
*  which is weird cause they played twice a year. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=245.14000000000001s)]
*  I would've guessed it was like, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=246.70000000000002s)]
*  and they've been in the league this whole time. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=248.38s)]
*  I would've guessed. Forever. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=249.98000000000002s)]
*  It would've been like eight, seven, 10. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=251.3s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=253.74s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=254.58s)]
*  Well, they're not gonna play again. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=255.42000000000002s)]
*  So that's good. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=256.38s)]
*  But yeah, that's, they're solid Washington. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=257.22s)]
*  As far as the coaches go with the fourth and two, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=260.3s)]
*  I was with you. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=263.22s)]
*  I like, just take the points in a lot of these situations. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=264.18s)]
*  I know they proved me wrong, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=267.70000000000005s)]
*  but the plays that were running for Jaden Daniels [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=268.90000000000003s)]
*  weren't great. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=270.70000000000005s)]
*  They were making them a pocket passer. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=271.54s)]
*  They're on like fourth and two and fourth and four. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=273.66s)]
*  So I was all for taking the points [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=275.90000000000003s)]
*  in most of those situations. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=277.98s)]
*  It's a different story when it's the Eagles [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=279.70000000000005s)]
*  and it's Hurts and Barkley. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=281.58000000000004s)]
*  And if I have Lamar, if I have Henry, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=282.94000000000005s)]
*  if I have Josh Allen. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=285.98s)]
*  But other than that, fourth and two is still fourth and two. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=287.5s)]
*  You can kick a field goal. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=290.46s)]
*  And I was okay with them leaving that field goal [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=291.86s)]
*  on the board too early on. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=293.62s)]
*  What did you think of Tampa potentially going for it [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=294.94s)]
*  down three with like four minutes left? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=297.78000000000003s)]
*  When it was like fourth and four? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=300.3s)]
*  That would've been like a fourth and three [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=301.14s)]
*  after they got stuffed twice. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=302.14s)]
*  Yeah, it was like fourth and three. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=303.46s)]
*  I don't like it after. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=305.5s)]
*  That was the play where like there was [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=306.34000000000003s)]
*  disarray at the line of scrimmage, right? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=309.94s)]
*  Like they fumbled. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=311.62s)]
*  I never liked the next play after that. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=312.46s)]
*  I don't know what it would've been. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=314.3s)]
*  I know there was like easy stuff happening with Evans, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=315.74s)]
*  but I kind of get it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=317.98s)]
*  Atleth, there's so much to go after bowls for. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=319.46s)]
*  That's not one of them. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=322.38s)]
*  Well, especially the end of the first half [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=323.5s)]
*  when he was mismanaging everything [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=326.21999999999997s)]
*  and somehow they scored anyway. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=327.65999999999997s)]
*  I thought they should kick the field goal. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=329.38s)]
*  And yet when they kicked the field goal, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=331.62s)]
*  I thought Washington was gonna come down [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=332.82s)]
*  and get the game winning field goal. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=334.18s)]
*  It was weird. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=335.5s)]
*  I didn't think they should go for it, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=336.34s)]
*  but I also thought they were gonna lose [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=338.02s)]
*  because they didn't get those two plays. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=339.62s)]
*  I just like saying Vita Vaya, Bill. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=342.70000000000005s)]
*  I'll say Vita Vaya over and over and over. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=344.74s)]
*  I tried to order Vita Vaya at Peter Lugar's. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=346.78000000000003s)]
*  They didn't have it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=349.66s)]
*  I mean, big picture. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=352.90000000000003s)]
*  And we know a lot of Washington fans. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=354.34000000000003s)]
*  This was the official fuck you Dan Snyder game. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=355.98s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=360.14000000000004s)]
*  It was one thing, it's a cute story. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=362.38s)]
*  They had a Hail Mary. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=364.26s)]
*  They got into the playoffs. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=365.38s)]
*  Dan Quinn, it's a family atmosphere. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=368.34000000000003s)]
*  They have a front office that actually knows [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=371.14000000000004s)]
*  what they're doing. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=372.86s)]
*  Adam Peters, they've turned the organization around. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=373.70000000000005s)]
*  That makes them look bad enough, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=375.78000000000003s)]
*  but now you have this awesome playoff win. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=377.02000000000004s)]
*  Now they're playing Detroit, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=379.54s)]
*  a team that doesn't have the most awesome defense, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=381.02000000000004s)]
*  at least until week 18 when they look pretty good [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=383.98s)]
*  against Minnesota, but Donald also left a lot of throws. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=385.98s)]
*  If I'm Washington, I feel like I can go in there [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=388.78000000000003s)]
*  and at least match points with Detroit. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=391.42s)]
*  Who the fuck knows, right? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=394.1s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=395.70000000000005s)]
*  Yes, you got a rookie quarterback that didn't, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=396.54s)]
*  like I said, didn't turn the ball over at all. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=398.46000000000004s)]
*  That's a pity man. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=401.5s)]
*  You have to think about, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=402.5s)]
*  a man right in front, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=403.58s)]
*  you got to have an organization to team up with you. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=405.02s)]
*  That's a game you want to play. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=407.18s)]
*  Sprinkle all your witness on this, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=408.74s)]
*  because it has been the picture. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=410.5s)]
*  And now they were at two-timeungs. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=412.82s)]
*  They didn't say who they would pick. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=415.3s)]
*  No one knew who they wanted to pick. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=416.7s)]
*  Like will they pick Greg Goode, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=418.22s)]
*  who's kind of the big old beehive guy [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=419.86s)]
*  that behind him in the field? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=422.18s)]
*  Freshman, you know that brand, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=424.7s)]
*  he did that in the game. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=426.02s)]
*  The search for the ë‚˜ì˜¨ Eagles would be [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=428.58s)]
*  We felt like it was headed that way for five days, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=430.04s)]
*  but I was getting intel that it was getting a little hairy [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=433.58000000000004s)]
*  on Friday night and Chicago was making a run at him. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=436.72s)]
*  And you think like, oh man, if we don't get him [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=441.36s)]
*  and we don't get Ben, all of a sudden we're looking [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=443.72s)]
*  at the Pete Carroll range of guys. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=446.40000000000003s)]
*  But they get Vrabel, they have Drake, May the Alba, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=448.92s)]
*  there's Capspace, they have the fourth pick. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=451.0s)]
*  And they had probably one of the worst rosters in the league, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=453.28000000000003s)]
*  if not the worst. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=456.48s)]
*  They're an individual with Buffalo. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=457.88s)]
*  There's all these reasons not to believe. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=459.3s)]
*  But I watch a team like Washington, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=461.14s)]
*  I'm like they turned it around in a year. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=462.5s)]
*  That team was a fucking shit can. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=464.14s)]
*  And they drafted the right quarterback, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=468.14s)]
*  they changed the coach, they brought in [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=469.9s)]
*  a really good coaching staff, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=471.3s)]
*  and all of a sudden they have 13 wins, Sal. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=472.86s)]
*  It's not like they're like a nine and 18 that snuck in. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=475.86s)]
*  Like this team's won 13 times. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=478.34s)]
*  And another strike against them was the ownership, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=480.34s)]
*  and there was defecation in the stadium. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=482.98s)]
*  I mean we can go on and on and on. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=485.58s)]
*  It doesn't really make sense. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=486.98s)]
*  Van Quinn's done a nice job with this team. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=488.1s)]
*  And like you said, this is just a, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=490.18s)]
*  they call it lightning in a bottle [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=492.98s)]
*  with this Jaden Daniels. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=494.34000000000003s)]
*  It's terrific. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=495.58000000000004s)]
*  But congratulations on Vrabel. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=496.90000000000003s)]
*  I think that's fun for you, right? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=498.34000000000003s)]
*  Good news to end the week? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=500.3s)]
*  Yeah, it feels like you need the coach, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=502.54s)]
*  you need the QB, and I can kind of figure out [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=506.54s)]
*  everything else, right? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=509.22s)]
*  But if I don't have those two things, where am I going? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=510.62s)]
*  And you need at least like a solid coach, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=513.46s)]
*  maybe better than that. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=516.1800000000001s)]
*  And you need a top 10 QB potentially. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=517.38s)]
*  And now they have the two things. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=520.14s)]
*  And now they can try to build their roster. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=521.74s)]
*  But I thought the way Washington did it was the blueprint. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=523.86s)]
*  They had a lot of really smart second level [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=526.94s)]
*  free agent signings, like the kind of going after [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=529.34s)]
*  like the B-list guys, like the best of the B-list. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=532.0600000000001s)]
*  And they spent a lot of money on their coaching staff. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=534.46s)]
*  So it seems replicable. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=536.94s)]
*  The Pats have a really super easy schedule. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=538.94s)]
*  Anyway, I was inspired by Washington. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=541.14s)]
*  The difference is Daniel's, he's in his mid-20s. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=543.3000000000001s)]
*  He's in college for nine years. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=546.06s)]
*  There's a reason he looks like a veteran. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=549.78s)]
*  He's almost as old as Joe Burrow. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=551.3s)]
*  I was thinking that with Bo Nicks too. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=553.6999999999999s)]
*  I was like, yeah, maybe I was wrong about all this [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=555.18s)]
*  and the rookies, if they have like 60 college games [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=557.18s)]
*  under their belt and they've all played [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=559.9s)]
*  in like high profile bowls and they don't really get shook. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=561.3399999999999s)]
*  But we'll talk about that game. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=565.0999999999999s)]
*  That's a whole different story. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=566.6199999999999s)]
*  But listen, I think part of you is saying [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=567.9799999999999s)]
*  Vrabel did this with Tannahill, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=569.66s)]
*  he could do it with Drake May. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=571.4599999999999s)]
*  Isn't that the bottom line? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=572.7399999999999s)]
*  He's never had an elite quarterback ever. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=574.66s)]
*  And hopefully Drake May can get there. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=577.5s)]
*  Well, I'm hoping. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=579.02s)]
*  Now I thought, I mean, I've talked about Vrabel [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=580.78s)]
*  a bunch of times on the pod. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=582.66s)]
*  I just felt like he was hands down [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=584.26s)]
*  the best coaching candidate available. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=586.94s)]
*  We'll see with Ben Johnson, but there's a big difference [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=588.42s)]
*  between calling plays and actually having to run [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=590.94s)]
*  a whole team and build the whole culture. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=594.26s)]
*  I think, I thought Tampa-Washington [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=596.14s)]
*  was the hardest game to pick. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=598.26s)]
*  Who'd you have in that game? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=599.3s)]
*  I picked it right, Ed Washington. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=600.7s)]
*  I actually won four and one. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=602.1800000000001s)]
*  My playoffs have been terrible over the last few years. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=603.38s)]
*  Did you get three and two or four and one? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=605.82s)]
*  What'd you do? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=607.94s)]
*  I had all those, I never did million dollar picks this week, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=608.7800000000001s)]
*  but I had all those anchor teasers [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=611.9s)]
*  with Buffalo and Baltimore. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=613.5s)]
*  Eight and a half point teases. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=615.98s)]
*  So Green Bay covered by half point. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=617.58s)]
*  The Tampa covered today. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=620.74s)]
*  I had a lot of trouble with, the Chargers lost yesterday. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=622.58s)]
*  I had a lot of trouble with Washington-Tampe [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=626.14s)]
*  because I liked the same thing about both teams. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=627.7800000000001s)]
*  I liked their offenses. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=631.14s)]
*  I liked the way their quarterbacks were playing. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=632.58s)]
*  And I thought that both of them [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=634.86s)]
*  were really these close knit teams. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=636.0600000000001s)]
*  You know, I was reading the stories about Tampa [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=638.7s)]
*  heading into the, out of the week 18 [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=640.6600000000001s)]
*  and like that Mike Evans play [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=643.98s)]
*  that we were joking about last week [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=645.3000000000001s)]
*  about, oh my God, that was kind of risky to go for it, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=647.14s)]
*  to go for a thousand yards. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=650.38s)]
*  You have the game, you're like the playoffs are annoying. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=651.46s)]
*  And you read the stories about it [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=654.3000000000001s)]
*  and guys were saying it was like [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=655.7800000000001s)]
*  the highlight of their careers. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=657.3000000000001s)]
*  Like they all loved Mike Evans [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=658.86s)]
*  and they were like, this record meant a lot to him. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=660.34s)]
*  He got hurt. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=662.7800000000001s)]
*  He didn't think he was going to be back in time [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=663.62s)]
*  to try to break it. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=665.0600000000001s)]
*  And there was just all this stuff [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=666.62s)]
*  and you could just feel the love coming out of that. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=667.9s)]
*  They love Baker Mayfield, they play hard for him. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=670.4200000000001s)]
*  So I was like, man, this is almost two teams. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=673.94s)]
*  I wish these two teams were playing two other teams [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=676.62s)]
*  so I could pick both of these teams as one of those. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=680.02s)]
*  Cause everything you read about Washington [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=682.14s)]
*  is the same thing. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=683.7800000000001s)]
*  Dan Quinn, he's turned the vibes around. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=684.82s)]
*  The mood is completely different. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=687.3000000000001s)]
*  And they ended up winning the mood ball, I guess. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=690.66s)]
*  I think we felt the same way about Rams Detroit last year. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=692.38s)]
*  Remember I watched your place and I go like, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=694.86s)]
*  why'd I have to square up in the first round? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=697.02s)]
*  This is good. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=699.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=700.02s)]
*  So yeah, Baker's great. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=700.86s)]
*  When he takes off, you have no choice but to root for him. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=702.18s)]
*  Somehow he's got legs. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=704.8199999999999s)]
*  There's like 200 more rushing yards this year [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=706.34s)]
*  than he has in the previous five, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=708.3s)]
*  any of the previous five or six. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=710.06s)]
*  Like it's really, it's spectacular. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=711.54s)]
*  And Mike Evans just diving backwards for a first down. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=713.42s)]
*  It is really tough. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=716.18s)]
*  Irving runs hard, defense plays hard. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=717.78s)]
*  It's a good team. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=720.86s)]
*  I had written down, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=721.7s)]
*  cause there seemed like they were gonna possibly win [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=723.2600000000001s)]
*  at one point, I was researching them. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=725.86s)]
*  They had a case for being the best 2020s NFC team [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=727.82s)]
*  and they still might have the case even now. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=731.62s)]
*  Cause they're one of the only two NFC teams [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=733.7800000000001s)]
*  that won a Super Bowl. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=735.86s)]
*  They've had four division titles. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=737.6600000000001s)]
*  They were six and three in the playoffs [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=739.86s)]
*  heading into this game today. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=741.74s)]
*  Over the last five seasons of 2020s, they're 51 and 33. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=743.98s)]
*  It was like, you would never think [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=748.3000000000001s)]
*  if you said to somebody who was the best team [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=749.38s)]
*  in the NFC this decade, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=750.9399999999999s)]
*  I don't think they would have been [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=752.7s)]
*  a top four guess for anybody, but I think they are. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=753.54s)]
*  It's either them or Philadelphia. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=756.3s)]
*  They have a better record and more playoff wins. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=757.5s)]
*  And then the loss today, like, you know, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=759.86s)]
*  I think they would have had a chance [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=762.3s)]
*  in round two against whoever they played. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=763.54s)]
*  But the Mayfield thing, when you think about, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=765.3s)]
*  he goes to Cleveland, plays for four coaches [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=769.38s)]
*  his first three seasons. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=771.9s)]
*  He wins their first playoff game with that franchise, right? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=773.82s)]
*  Since they came back, he tore his labrum [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=777.82s)]
*  in his left shoulder, second game, 2021 [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=781.1800000000001s)]
*  has the year from hell. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=783.22s)]
*  They ended up paying him to go away, 11 million to Carolina [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=784.42s)]
*  and go into the Sean thing. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=787.78s)]
*  And now Baker, he's not a top five quarterback, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=789.7s)]
*  but he's in the top 10 or 11. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=792.82s)]
*  And you just think like this whole thing [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=795.58s)]
*  is one of the biggest disaster decisions [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=797.14s)]
*  start to finish in the history of the league. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=799.38s)]
*  It's so hard, I think for us, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=801.74s)]
*  I don't want people to feel bad for us [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=803.22s)]
*  cause we're doing what we love, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=804.58s)]
*  but we look at football and players, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=805.7s)]
*  I think through all different lenses, right? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=808.3399999999999s)]
*  We'd look at them like historically, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=809.5s)]
*  we look at fantasy wise, like Baker's great, exciting. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=811.06s)]
*  He's top three or four, five exciting. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=814.54s)]
*  And it's like, okay, but where does that put him [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=817.18s)]
*  and actually, in terms of building a team around him? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=819.14s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=822.78s)]
*  I don't know if I wanna say he's top four or five [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=823.66s)]
*  or anywhere in there, but I love watching them [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=826.5799999999999s)]
*  and I love everything he brings to that team. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=829.2199999999999s)]
*  And I feel like he's in the prime of his career. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=831.14s)]
*  Don't compare him to Flacco, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=834.02s)]
*  don't compare him to any of these other guys. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=835.3s)]
*  I hope people don't do that anymore. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=837.14s)]
*  And I think you're right, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=838.9s)]
*  they were one of the best teams in the NFC. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=839.74s)]
*  I think they get a bad rap [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=841.82s)]
*  because it's the South that they keep winning. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=843.46s)]
*  But they can't help that. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=845.5s)]
*  And we make fun of the South every year. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=846.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's our fault. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=847.1800000000001s)]
*  The thing if you're talking about just QB assets, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=849.98s)]
*  and we always talk about a rookie QB, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=852.62s)]
*  how that's the best asset you can have. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=854.38s)]
*  But they have him, his contract, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=857.1s)]
*  compared to the other monster contracts [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=858.58s)]
*  where every other superstar's making 50, 55 million a year, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=860.38s)]
*  whatever they're on the cap for. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=864.62s)]
*  And I think he signed for like 30, 30 plus a year, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=865.78s)]
*  something like that. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=868.9399999999999s)]
*  So definitely a better asset. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=869.78s)]
*  Anyway, that was a great game for the weekend, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=872.9s)]
*  because up until that point, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=878.5s)]
*  it felt like it was the worst weekend ever [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=880.74s)]
*  for a variety of reasons, real life reasons, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=883.54s)]
*  the actual games. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=886.26s)]
*  It was just one of those weekends you're like, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=887.3399999999999s)]
*  man, I used to love round one. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=889.78s)]
*  And this time I feel stupid watching football. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=892.26s)]
*  Once the college games were really good, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=896.46s)]
*  I'm like, oh, the NFL is gonna suck now, isn't it? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=897.94s)]
*  We can't just have all the good things. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=900.46s)]
*  Right, the college games are excellent. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=901.3s)]
*  Yeah, they were very good. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=902.94s)]
*  And then coming into this weekend. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=904.02s)]
*  But a lot of people all over, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=905.26s)]
*  can we just accept the fact [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=907.98s)]
*  that we're probably not gonna get good competitive games [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=910.14s)]
*  in any sport in the playoffs for the first couple of rounds? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=913.54s)]
*  Can all we really hope for is a good final four [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=916.86s)]
*  as sports fans and not like tear each other's eyes out, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=919.9s)]
*  arguing over who has the better system? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=923.5s)]
*  Like the NBA might actually have the best. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=925.58s)]
*  There are some good four or five matchups every year. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=927.46s)]
*  But then they have some finals that suck too. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=930.46s)]
*  So I think you just have to hope that the final four is good [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=932.34s)]
*  and let the cream rise to the top. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=936.1s)]
*  Yeah, weirdly the NBA might be in the best shape [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=940.1800000000001s)]
*  for a round one this year, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=942.82s)]
*  because they have so much talent [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=943.9000000000001s)]
*  and they have some teams in the seven, eight, nine, 10 range [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=945.82s)]
*  that the play-ins will be fun. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=948.58s)]
*  Now you're mad at me about the Sacramento. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=951.54s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sorry. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=953.66s)]
*  I didn't mean to talk about the NBA at all. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=954.5s)]
*  I was just using it as one of the many examples. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=955.94s)]
*  No, because I saw your mind go to the Sacramento, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=957.78s)]
*  Indiana, Minnesota bet we made. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=959.9s)]
*  How's this team is gonna win for the first time in 20 years? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=962.06s)]
*  And you're talking about this stupid parlay we have [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=965.18s)]
*  with Sacramento and Indiana. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=967.22s)]
*  The Sacramento under, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=968.78s)]
*  Indiana over, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=970.18s)]
*  and the Minnesota under. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=971.54s)]
*  And after we did it, Sacramento fired their coach [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=973.02s)]
*  and now they're just pulling games out of their ass, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=975.62s)]
*  game after game after game. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=977.9s)]
*  All right, so our schedule, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=979.58s)]
*  before we get to the rest of the games, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=980.58s)]
*  we have Houston and Kansas City. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=982.22s)]
*  That's an ESPN game. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=984.46s)]
*  On Saturday, it's the first one. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=986.22s)]
*  We need a name for the round two first game on Saturday. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=988.26s)]
*  It's not a Shakey's game, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=991.46s)]
*  but it's a better restaurant [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=992.6600000000001s)]
*  that you know you can probably rent a table for, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=996.1800000000001s)]
*  get a table for like 20, 25. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1000.1s)]
*  You wouldn't exactly have your wedding reception there, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1003.22s)]
*  but it's serviceable and solid. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1005.26s)]
*  It's kind of exciting, but not totally. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1007.34s)]
*  I guess I don't want to insult any possible sponsors [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1009.8199999999999s)]
*  we might get, but it's like a Shakey upgrade. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1011.8199999999999s)]
*  Houston was in Shakey's and now they're in this one. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1016.02s)]
*  So it's like Shakey's opened like a pop-up, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1018.18s)]
*  and like somewhere, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1021.38s)]
*  and it's like in a cool area maybe. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1023.9399999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1026.02s)]
*  It's still the first Saturday game. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1026.86s)]
*  Kyle says the Texas Roadhouse game. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1029.1399999999999s)]
*  Texas Roadhouses are fun. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1031.34s)]
*  Yeah, that's good. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1033.22s)]
*  I was gonna say the Bianco pizza game, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1034.34s)]
*  but I don't want Bianco to be mad at me, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1036.06s)]
*  because Bianco could do like a pizza pop-up, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1037.78s)]
*  but you might take that personally, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1039.7s)]
*  even though I'm complimenting it, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1041.66s)]
*  because I love Bianco pizza. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1042.66s)]
*  Houston at KCESPN, then Saturday night, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1045.1s)]
*  Washington at Detroit, Sunday, NBC, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1048.06s)]
*  either Minnesota or the Rams playing in Philadelphia. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1054.1399999999999s)]
*  So we get Collinsworth in Philadelphia. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1056.74s)]
*  Oh, Mike, it's so cold. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1059.82s)]
*  My nipples are frozen, Mike. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1061.22s)]
*  I can't even feel my nipples. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1063.74s)]
*  Can I feel your nipples, Mike? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1066.26s)]
*  Because I can't feel my nipples. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1068.22s)]
*  I have no feeling, Mike. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1069.46s)]
*  That's not a night game, huh? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1070.74s)]
*  So they're doing that three Eastern on Sunday, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1072.46s)]
*  and then Romo Nance get the good one, the great one. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1076.86s)]
*  Baltimore at Buffalo. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1080.62s)]
*  So the storylines, I guess, would be [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1083.22s)]
*  KC going for the three-peat, it officially starts now. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1086.82s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1090.7s)]
*  Jade and Daniels and the exciting, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1091.78s)]
*  rejuvenated Washington commanders [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1093.58s)]
*  against the team that's really been America's team [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1096.82s)]
*  this year, the Detroit Lions, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1099.82s)]
*  where they've just been on every week. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1101.3s)]
*  We like watching them. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1102.82s)]
*  We know all the characters at this point. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1103.86s)]
*  Dan Campbell's like the dad in a Friday sitcom. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1105.5s)]
*  Then, I don't know, what's more fun, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1109.34s)]
*  Minnesota, Philadelphia or Rams, Philadelphia? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1111.98s)]
*  Probably Minnesota, Philadelphia, right, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1115.18s)]
*  for the history of some of the games they've had? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1116.78s)]
*  I guess it would have to be. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1119.5400000000002s)]
*  I'm a little down on Philadelphia. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1120.7800000000002s)]
*  What's Minnesota's number one in the Super Bowl? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1122.6200000000001s)]
*  Do you feel like Philadelphia's gonna make [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1124.1000000000001s)]
*  every game shitty now, no matter who plays it? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1125.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, hold that thought for 30 seconds. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1127.74s)]
*  And then Baltimore-Buffalo is the... [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1130.1000000000001s)]
*  Great. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1131.9s)]
*  That's it, that's what's decided. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1132.74s)]
*  MVP. You rarely get this. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1134.14s)]
*  You get this in basketball sometimes. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1135.38s)]
*  You rarely get this in the NFL, where it's like, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1137.7800000000002s)]
*  we've argued about this all year. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1139.5800000000002s)]
*  I think it's been a fun argument. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1141.2600000000002s)]
*  I don't feel like it ever degenerated anything bad. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1142.5s)]
*  I'm still not positive who I think the MVP is. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1145.38s)]
*  I left on the weekend, I'm like, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1148.5s)]
*  both of those guys were awesome. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1150.58s)]
*  I still don't know who the MVP was. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1152.1000000000001s)]
*  They're excellent. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1154.5s)]
*  I'll stand by Josh Allen, but again, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1155.3400000000001s)]
*  you can't really be mad at what's going on [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1157.54s)]
*  if one or the other wins it. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1159.6200000000001s)]
*  I'll say, it seems like Lamar has a little more help [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1162.46s)]
*  with Derrick Henry, but other than that, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1165.94s)]
*  they did beat Buffalo. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1168.26s)]
*  They beat him pretty good. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1169.6200000000001s)]
*  Buffalo beat the one seed. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1171.02s)]
*  You can go either way. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1172.3400000000001s)]
*  All right, the game before the good game [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1174.42s)]
*  was Packers Eagles, which was a classic Philadelphia win [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1176.78s)]
*  where they're up 10-0 and their fans are just complaining. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1181.3s)]
*  The game has no flow. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1185.7s)]
*  You don't really understand what's going on. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1188.1s)]
*  The game, I actually watched with a couple [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1190.38s)]
*  of Eagles fans today, and they're cutting to AJ Brown. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1192.58s)]
*  He's reading a book at one point [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1195.54s)]
*  because he's pissed off, he's not getting the ball. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1196.94s)]
*  Everyone's like, what's wrong with Hertz? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1199.34s)]
*  Is he healthy? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1200.94s)]
*  What's going on with him? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1201.78s)]
*  They just kind of limped their way to a convincing win [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1203.78s)]
*  that was never in doubt, and they win by double digits, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1206.7s)]
*  and they lead the game, and you go, what just happened? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1209.14s)]
*  Are the Eagles good? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1211.82s)]
*  It just was typical. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1213.98s)]
*  Yeah, and I hated the one. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1215.8600000000001s)]
*  This is the one I'm gonna get salty about [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1217.46s)]
*  because it's the one I lost, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1219.74s)]
*  but I had Green Bay plus the points. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1221.02s)]
*  I wouldn't say Washington deserved to win as a road team. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1224.02s)]
*  Fine, none of the other road teams showed up. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1228.1000000000001s)]
*  Denver, Green Bay, you can't make a case [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1231.22s)]
*  for any of the Pittsburgh, but get that kickoff right, man. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1233.18s)]
*  Just get that right. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1237.38s)]
*  It's all about momentum when you're on the road. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1238.9s)]
*  If you're gonna lose a call, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1240.78s)]
*  if you're gonna lose the opening kickoff, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1241.94s)]
*  you're really kind of screwed there, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1243.98s)]
*  and I feel like there were enough replays, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1245.5800000000002s)]
*  including the overhead, to show that the Packers jumped it. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1247.5800000000002s)]
*  Oh, I like this, okay. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1250.9s)]
*  I'm not a ref killer. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1253.0600000000002s)]
*  Every time the Chiefs games are decided by something close, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1254.46s)]
*  I'm like, ah, it's hard to call it regular speed, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1257.14s)]
*  but if you're able to replay something [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1259.14s)]
*  and you have all those angles and you have that overhead, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1262.1000000000001s)]
*  he had it for like a two Mississippi count. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1264.7s)]
*  Is it easier now to just start digging your way [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1267.38s)]
*  through the earth to come out the other end? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1270.8200000000002s)]
*  Is that easier to come out with the ball [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1272.98s)]
*  than it is to come up from a pile above the ground? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1274.66s)]
*  I don't know, I don't like that, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1277.74s)]
*  but anyway, I had to get that off my chest. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1279.0200000000002s)]
*  They've really made it seem like it's now a reality show [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1281.66s)]
*  or it's like season 41 of the challenge. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1284.8200000000002s)]
*  Just put 10 guys in a pile. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1287.3000000000002s)]
*  Whoever has the ball, when we pull everybody apart, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1289.94s)]
*  they get the ball. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1292.22s)]
*  I texted you a couple times over the weekend. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1293.38s)]
*  I watch football every weekend. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1296.5800000000002s)]
*  I feel like I understand all the rules. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1298.42s)]
*  I still don't understand what an intentional grounding is. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1300.02s)]
*  CJ Stroud, that was one of the biggest plays [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1302.7s)]
*  in that Chargers game. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1304.5400000000002s)]
*  Just seemed like a cut and dry intentional grounding. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1305.7s)]
*  They were like, nah, he got it over the line of scrimmage [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1308.8600000000001s)]
*  and he was out of the pocket. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1311.3400000000001s)]
*  I was like, he was out of the pocket? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1312.42s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1313.98s)]
*  He was two feet to the left? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1314.8200000000002s)]
*  How was he out of the pocket? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1316.02s)]
*  It just seemed like an automatic, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1317.74s)]
*  he definitely did an intentional grounding [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1319.42s)]
*  because he was about to get sacked. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1321.0600000000002s)]
*  So they said it wasn't. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1322.5s)]
*  And then I always felt like if the guy clearly had the ball [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1324.0200000000002s)]
*  in the pile before he disappeared into the pile, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1327.0200000000002s)]
*  usually the guy gets the ball back. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1330.5s)]
*  Of course. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1332.3400000000001s)]
*  But this time they were like, nope, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1333.18s)]
*  he didn't totally have it yet. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1334.5400000000002s)]
*  It's like he didn't seem like he had it. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1335.8200000000002s)]
*  It also goes against all their crap about player safety. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1338.38s)]
*  Like, oh really? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1341.18s)]
*  We're gonna keep this going past the whistle [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1342.1000000000001s)]
*  because you obviously blew the whistle [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1343.98s)]
*  and then this guy got it like torn from his clutches. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1346.26s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1349.54s)]
*  Anyway, Green Bay didn't score enough to win that game [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1350.7s)]
*  and every receiver was hurt [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1353.38s)]
*  and I don't know who they were throwing to. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1354.78s)]
*  So good for you, Philly, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1356.14s)]
*  but they didn't play great either. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1357.82s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1360.9s)]
*  I've said this over and over again watching them. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1362.06s)]
*  I don't understand their offense. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1363.9s)]
*  I don't understand why it's so slow and deliberate [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1365.54s)]
*  and has no pace and has no pep [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1367.9s)]
*  and just seems laborious at all times. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1369.9s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1372.34s)]
*  We were joking about it in the first quarter [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1374.46s)]
*  and we were watching them like here we go, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1377.0600000000002s)]
*  39 seconds till the next Saquon handoff. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1378.9s)]
*  This will be 37 seconds. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1380.42s)]
*  And it's just, they play with no pace. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1382.0600000000002s)]
*  They play with no unpredictability at all. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1383.9s)]
*  They never try to put any sort of pressure. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1386.8200000000002s)]
*  You'd think like if you have Saquon as a running back [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1388.5800000000002s)]
*  with Hertz's ability to run and pass [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1391.5800000000002s)]
*  and the receivers they have, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1393.38s)]
*  you could almost go no huddle and just put a defense, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1394.8600000000001s)]
*  put them on their back pedal. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1398.14s)]
*  They don't do anything. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1399.5400000000002s)]
*  They're just like, don't do all your subs. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1400.42s)]
*  Get all your guys in and out. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1402.7s)]
*  Do what you need to do. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1404.0600000000002s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1406.14s)]
*  And for the most part, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1406.98s)]
*  as long as they don't get in a third and long situation, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1407.8200000000002s)]
*  they're fine. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1409.7s)]
*  If they're third and three or third and one, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1410.5400000000002s)]
*  they can line up for the tush push on third and one [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1412.3400000000001s)]
*  and he can back out and throw it long like we saw [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1414.5s)]
*  or hand it to Barclay. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1416.9s)]
*  It is a huge, huge advantage. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1418.22s)]
*  What the Ravens do, what the Bills do [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1420.46s)]
*  and specifically what the Eagles do with the tush push [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1422.3000000000002s)]
*  and third and short. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1425.46s)]
*  I mean, because you're gonna convert on fourth. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1426.5400000000002s)]
*  But yeah, everything this team does bugs me. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1428.5400000000002s)]
*  Now Barclay, enough with the sliding down. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1430.7s)]
*  You're an unselfish player. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1433.5s)]
*  Should you be a social worker maybe? [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1434.98s)]
*  Like score touchdowns. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1436.54s)]
*  People are betting on you to score touchdowns. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1437.9s)]
*  Enough already. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1440.1000000000001s)]
*  It's not like the over. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1440.94s)]
*  It's not like you're up one and you don't wanna go up eight [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1442.94s)]
*  because they're gonna get the ball. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1445.6200000000001s)]
*  Like just finish it. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1446.66s)]
*  It's crazy already. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1448.8600000000001s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1449.78s)]
*  I actually re-rounded it. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1451.02s)]
*  Seemed like the D back had an angle [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1452.38s)]
*  and maybe could have chased him down 30 yards downfield. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1454.5800000000002s)]
*  But yeah, he definitely slid a little early. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1457.66s)]
*  There was a couple of moments today [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1461.26s)]
*  with covers and over-unders [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1462.66s)]
*  because you had that play. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1464.06s)]
*  You had Matt Collins about to go. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1465.5s)]
*  He's setting up the Bills on the two yard line. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1467.78s)]
*  Next touchdown covers, every tease and adjusted over [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1470.5s)]
*  if you had 41, 42, whatever. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1474.3s)]
*  And then what was the other one? [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1477.3s)]
*  Was that Baltimore Pittsburgh just ending at 42 points? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1479.34s)]
*  That felt like that could have been higher, right? [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1483.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, the Steelers had like 200 yards in third quarter [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1485.06s)]
*  and then there was no points at all after that play. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1487.5s)]
*  The Chargers-Texans game somehow going over. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1489.8999999999999s)]
*  What were the odds of that? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1493.3s)]
*  It was like seven, six. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1494.8600000000001s)]
*  I mean, the first, I don't know [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1496.18s)]
*  when you want to talk about that. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1497.18s)]
*  One more thing on Hertz though. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1498.38s)]
*  His three winning playoff games, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1499.6200000000001s)]
*  131 yards against the Packers, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1502.02s)]
*  121 yards passing against the Niners, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1504.1000000000001s)]
*  154 against the Giants. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1506.42s)]
*  Like I don't know if we've ever seen anything like this. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1508.8600000000001s)]
*  I know he's not asked to do that much [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1510.6200000000001s)]
*  and he doesn't and they win. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1512.78s)]
*  Well, and he's not even like when they're celebrating [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1516.06s)]
*  at the end he seems on this side. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1517.94s)]
*  He's such a polarizing guy within the Eagles. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1519.38s)]
*  I know a lot of Eagles fans, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1523.2600000000002s)]
*  none of them have a handle on him at all, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1524.7800000000002s)]
*  but yet they've been winning [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1526.74s)]
*  and they've been successful with them, right? [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1527.8600000000001s)]
*  But you watch and it's just, I don't know. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1529.5400000000002s)]
*  When you look at like what we saw from Allen and Mahomes [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1534.7s)]
*  in somewhat similar offensive situations [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1537.7800000000002s)]
*  from a weapons standpoint and they're just so electric. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1541.5400000000002s)]
*  And I guess Hertz just doesn't have that level in him. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1544.6200000000001s)]
*  When he shoots off to the side, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1548.54s)]
*  he'll take a hard hit for a two yard gain, right? [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1551.1s)]
*  Like I feel like, I'm like, hey, cut it up. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1553.82s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1555.7s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1556.54s)]
*  I'm not gonna, whatever. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1557.38s)]
*  He's gone to the Super Bowl and everything. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1558.42s)]
*  But just read a book on the sideline every now and then, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1560.5s)]
*  Jalen, come on. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1563.42s)]
*  Read Inter Excellence, but borrow a copy from AJ Brown. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1565.34s)]
*  I was thinking Eagles fans, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1568.66s)]
*  because the team has been successful, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1570.06s)]
*  but they also love complaining about them [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1573.42s)]
*  and I don't really blame them, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1575.22s)]
*  but it's like the friend who's married to the guy [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1576.26s)]
*  that you always feel like they're gonna get divorced [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1580.5800000000002s)]
*  and they're never divorced, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1582.3s)]
*  but she's always complaining about him. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1584.46s)]
*  That's kind of the Eagles fans with this team. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1586.7s)]
*  Yeah, you think they grew for the Panthers all these years. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1588.02s)]
*  To a point where you're like, oh, does your team suck? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1590.46s)]
*  I mean, you keep saying they do. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1592.54s)]
*  Didn't you go 13 and four? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1594.18s)]
*  Green Bay was kind of the hipster [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1596.7s)]
*  Super Bowl contender this year. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1600.98s)]
*  They were like the alternate pick. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1603.7s)]
*  I know we had money on them. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1605.1s)]
*  We both loved Detroit with the one seed [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1606.5s)]
*  and some Super Bowl bets, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1608.3799999999999s)]
*  but then Green Bay was kind of the, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1609.3s)]
*  well, here's plan B if the Detroit thing doesn't work out. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1611.4199999999998s)]
*  They ended up going 0-6 against Philly and Minnesota [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1614.7s)]
*  and Detroit. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1617.5s)]
*  This was more alarming to me. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1620.82s)]
*  I'm throwing out the Brazil game in week one, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1622.1399999999999s)]
*  because that game was stupid. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1623.98s)]
*  They're playing it and I don't understand [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1625.1399999999999s)]
*  what that field was. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1627.22s)]
*  In the other games against those three teams, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1629.34s)]
*  they fell behind by 21 to Minnesota, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1631.94s)]
*  by 17 to Minnesota. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1635.74s)]
*  They fell behind 21 to Detroit. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1637.7s)]
*  They were down 10 to Detroit [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1639.98s)]
*  and they were down 10 today, 10 nothing. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1641.62s)]
*  This was them against any good team. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1644.1s)]
*  They just immediately spotted 10, 12, 17 points, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1645.66s)]
*  whatever it was. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1649.3s)]
*  And there was a couple of times where they would [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1650.1399999999999s)]
*  kind of come back. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1651.8999999999999s)]
*  What changed today was they lost Watson before the game [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1653.1s)]
*  and then they lose two more weapons. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1657.1399999999999s)]
*  So they couldn't even do the comeback thing [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1658.62s)]
*  that Love was pretty good at. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1660.1s)]
*  I thought Love had a really bad year [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1661.58s)]
*  and that's what my expectations were. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1663.34s)]
*  My expectations were an A-. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1664.4199999999998s)]
*  I thought he was like a C+. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1667.02s)]
*  I agree. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1669.26s)]
*  I don't know when, I'm trying to think when we loved them. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1670.1s)]
*  When did we fall in love with that team? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1672.82s)]
*  When were they peaking? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1674.6599999999999s)]
*  Was it six weeks ago? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1675.54s)]
*  Because you're right, they never really beat [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1676.74s)]
*  the good teams. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1678.58s)]
*  But they never really put together good. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1679.6999999999998s)]
*  I guess they were just beating up the crap. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1681.78s)]
*  No, they had, they beat up Miami on Thanksgiving. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1684.1s)]
*  There was that Thanksgiving in the week after. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1686.54s)]
*  We should remember this for next year, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1689.4199999999998s)]
*  because there was a moment where Green Bay looked like [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1690.9399999999998s)]
*  the most dangerous NFC team. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1693.98s)]
*  Pittsburgh looked like they had the one seed locked up. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1695.42s)]
*  They had already beaten Baltimore. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1698.3000000000002s)]
*  They had two game lead. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1699.7800000000002s)]
*  They, I think were 10 and three. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1701.22s)]
*  And it just felt like they were gonna be 13 and three. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1703.6200000000001s)]
*  They never won again. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1706.26s)]
*  They were 10 and three. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1707.1000000000001s)]
*  And that was it. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1709.5800000000002s)]
*  They went, I think they lost their last five [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1710.42s)]
*  and just completely fell apart. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1715.0600000000002s)]
*  We can talk about that later. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1717.14s)]
*  But yeah, those were the two teams [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1718.38s)]
*  that I think really fell off. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1720.38s)]
*  And then conversely, Washington came back. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1721.62s)]
*  I think cause Daniels got healthy [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1725.6599999999999s)]
*  was probably the main reason for it. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1727.4199999999998s)]
*  And then Houston died. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1730.1s)]
*  And then just randomly their defense came back [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1732.5s)]
*  at some point during that Chargers game, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1736.6599999999999s)]
*  which we're gonna talk about in a second. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1738.2199999999998s)]
*  But I think those were kind of the variance teams. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1739.58s)]
*  I guess the Chiefs might've been the other one [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1742.62s)]
*  cause the Chiefs were looking so creaky there. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1744.34s)]
*  And we were like, this offense, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1746.7399999999998s)]
*  they're just gonna be able to score 20 points anymore. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1747.86s)]
*  And then they gradually figured that out. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1750.18s)]
*  Everything else has kind of went toward what we thought. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1751.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1755.42s)]
*  Like after Saturday, I'm like, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1756.26s)]
*  well, have we learned anything about the Chargers [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1757.3s)]
*  and Steelers other than it's the same team [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1758.94s)]
*  we've been looking at for eight years, right? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1760.66s)]
*  You can't really trust them. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1762.98s)]
*  They, Steelers knuckleballed away to the playoffs [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1764.6200000000001s)]
*  without a good quarterback and then don't show up. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1768.3400000000001s)]
*  I don't know what you want to talk about next, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1770.42s)]
*  but the Chargers were just brutal too. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1771.5800000000002s)]
*  Well, one thing on Green Bay, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1774.74s)]
*  cause I wanna move to Bills and Steelers. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1776.22s)]
*  I thought their D was good. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1778.9s)]
*  And I thought they did a good job today. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1780.8600000000001s)]
*  I thought Jacobs was good. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1782.5s)]
*  Earl Campbell run, his old jersey coming apart. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1784.38s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1787.42s)]
*  I like Watson as a player, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1788.6200000000001s)]
*  but I don't think it should be a dramatic difference. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1789.98s)]
*  I like their tight ends, craft of Musgrave. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1792.02s)]
*  I don't know what, I don't remember, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1793.98s)]
*  I don't know Musgrave was hurt [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1795.66s)]
*  or if he played or what happened, but. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1796.9s)]
*  And then they lost. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1799.5800000000002s)]
*  Crap design of my doing the tush push, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1800.42s)]
*  their version of tush push. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1802.42s)]
*  Hey, I don't wanna make excuses for them [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1803.5400000000002s)]
*  cause they got beat, probably shouldn't have won. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1805.0600000000002s)]
*  But that kickoff is a huge moment. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1806.6200000000001s)]
*  You can't turn it over on the road [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1808.98s)]
*  and you can't miss field goals. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1810.66s)]
*  Like they missed field goals. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1812.1000000000001s)]
*  Denver missed a field goal. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1813.5s)]
*  They weren't gonna win that game. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1814.66s)]
*  But that's it. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1815.5s)]
*  If you pause by the playoff game [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1816.3400000000001s)]
*  and the road team is getting the opening kickoff [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1817.18s)]
*  and fumbles on the kickoff, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1819.26s)]
*  it's almost like the live bet. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1821.3000000000002s)]
*  You almost wanna bet everything on the other team [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1822.8200000000002s)]
*  no matter. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1824.78s)]
*  It just feels like the worst element possible [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1825.6200000000001s)]
*  for the rest of the game. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1827.5800000000002s)]
*  But the bottom line is Jordan Love wasn't good. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1828.78s)]
*  And there's probably some reasons for it [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1832.0600000000002s)]
*  that have to do with some of the weapons being gone, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1834.26s)]
*  but he made some really bad throws. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1836.74s)]
*  And I never felt like last year, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1838.6200000000001s)]
*  especially in the playoffs, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1841.54s)]
*  it felt like he was elevating. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1842.74s)]
*  I didn't feel that way at all down the stretch here. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1844.14s)]
*  You know, I guess the bottom line, the message is [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1847.1s)]
*  don't fall in love with these quarterbacks too much. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1849.94s)]
*  Jordan Love, CJ Stroud, even though he won, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1852.14s)]
*  not as good a year. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1854.98s)]
*  Drake May, you know, I can go on and on. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1856.66s)]
*  Just don't fall in love with these guys. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1859.1s)]
*  All right, so I'm lumping Bills, Broncos, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1860.54s)]
*  and Steelers, Ravens together because this whole season. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1862.3s)]
*  Everyone else did on a teaser. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1866.46s)]
*  Right, because we did it on a teaser. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1868.42s)]
*  It was the, we called it the anchor tease [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1870.1000000000001s)]
*  or the anchor parlay, whatever you wanted. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1872.98s)]
*  My favorite was either these eight or eight and a half point [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1875.66s)]
*  teases you could do with them on Fandl [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1878.6200000000001s)]
*  and basically put anyone else you want, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1882.94s)]
*  move the line eight points, eight and a half points, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1884.8200000000002s)]
*  it's right around even odds. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1886.74s)]
*  And it just seemed like a free way [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1888.0600000000002s)]
*  to gain eight points with everybody. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1890.26s)]
*  It won with Tampa, it didn't win with the Chargers. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1891.66s)]
*  It won with Houston. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1894.18s)]
*  I thought we were gonna lose Fandl as a sponsor. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1896.26s)]
*  I was like, is a favorite ever gonna lose again? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1898.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1900.58s)]
*  And then when Tampa was winning tonight, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1901.42s)]
*  I don't even know, but yeah, they gave it to us. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1903.14s)]
*  Look, there's a lot of storylines for the year. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1906.5s)]
*  Washington and Jaden Daniels, the Lions, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1908.6200000000001s)]
*  the Vikings coming out of nowhere, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1911.74s)]
*  the Chiefs going for a three-peat. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1913.7s)]
*  Like there's a lot going on. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1915.46s)]
*  But this Josh versus Lamar thing [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1916.82s)]
*  ended up being the most fun thing to argue about. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1918.46s)]
*  Lots of. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1921.1s)]
*  And it never, as I said earlier, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1921.94s)]
*  I never thought it got ugly, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1923.38s)]
*  because both guys have been great. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1926.5s)]
*  And what's cool is both guys peeking at the right time. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1927.74s)]
*  So today, Buffalo rushes 44 for 210. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1930.5800000000002s)]
*  And experimented with putting like [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1935.94s)]
*  the sixth offensive lineman out there as a tight end [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1937.8200000000002s)]
*  and just like bully balled [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1940.26s)]
*  their way through the first half. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1944.14s)]
*  And then Baltimore yesterday, 50 carries for 299. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1945.3s)]
*  Buffalo had the ball 41 minutes. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1949.38s)]
*  Baltimore at 39, 33. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1952.22s)]
*  So two teams that love having the ball, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1955.66s)]
*  running it down your throats, playing each other [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1957.54s)]
*  with two magical quarterbacks, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1959.34s)]
*  who also in the playoffs run the ball more. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1961.54s)]
*  This is like one of the best games of the decade. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1964.54s)]
*  I'm so excited for it. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1967.42s)]
*  It's an incredible advantage. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1968.7s)]
*  Like I said, these two teams have me, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1970.1000000000001s)]
*  even more than like Detroit. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1971.54s)]
*  Like I'm wowed by Detroit's offense too. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1972.9s)]
*  But when you have like Josh Allen, like rolling left, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1975.42s)]
*  it just looks weird. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1978.26s)]
*  Variety quarterback rolling left [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1979.18s)]
*  and he could slide, slither his way for like seven yards. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1981.14s)]
*  And then Lamar did that. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1984.14s)]
*  I think he probably had like five of the first eight [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1985.6200000000001s)]
*  carries against the Steelers. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1987.5s)]
*  I'm like, oh, this game's over too. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1988.7800000000002s)]
*  They're done too. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1990.46s)]
*  So yeah, when they go against each other, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1991.6200000000001s)]
*  I was so nervous about that Buffalo game Simmons. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1994.3400000000001s)]
*  I'm like, we all need this to complete a parlay. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1997.0200000000002s)]
*  I had a last eight to start it [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=1999.7800000000002s)]
*  and then anchored with these other two. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2001.5800000000002s)]
*  And the orange pants were a killer on the eyes for Denver. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2003.1000000000001s)]
*  And then they scored right away. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2006.5s)]
*  I'm like, shit, this is what they take. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2008.0600000000002s)]
*  Well, we knew Denver was gonna make us sweat it out [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2008.98s)]
*  in the first quarter. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2011.66s)]
*  That was just the law. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2012.5s)]
*  There was just too much money. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2013.42s)]
*  And then I was thinking about if you tease them [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2015.7s)]
*  and Buffalo could win by one, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2017.9s)]
*  but you still don't cover the tease. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2019.42s)]
*  There are all these different ways. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2020.8200000000002s)]
*  But then Buffalo was like, we got this. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2022.42s)]
*  I think combining the two of them, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2026.22s)]
*  I think they're the two best, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2029.5400000000002s)]
*  how do you stop this offenses we've had in a while. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2031.38s)]
*  And I'm not ready to talk about them historically. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2036.66s)]
*  And one of them might score seven points next week. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2039.46s)]
*  But just when you're watching the moment [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2041.5800000000002s)]
*  in these playoff games, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2043.66s)]
*  now that these quarterbacks don't have to worry [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2044.6200000000001s)]
*  about saving their bodies to the playoffs [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2046.3400000000001s)]
*  and can actually run and try to do stuff. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2048.1400000000003s)]
*  Daniels was like this too with Washington. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2050.62s)]
*  I just don't know what the move is [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2053.3s)]
*  when it's like third and four. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2055.42s)]
*  You almost have to guess what the play is. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2059.42s)]
*  Tech Mobile style, charge Allen. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2061.58s)]
*  He's still gonna stiff arm the first guy, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2064.14s)]
*  roll out and try to hit somebody's sidearm [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2066.22s)]
*  as he's rolling. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2068.74s)]
*  And then Lamar is just like, he's like covered in grease. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2069.7799999999997s)]
*  Even if you stop him, he's going by you. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2073.86s)]
*  So I can't wait to watch this. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2075.86s)]
*  Romo said he's like, you could have a spy on these guys, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2078.66s)]
*  but they're just better than all the spies. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2081.2999999999997s)]
*  They're faster. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2083.14s)]
*  They have a better, keener sense of the field [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2084.8199999999997s)]
*  than all the spies. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2086.7799999999997s)]
*  And it's just tough. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2087.74s)]
*  And you look at the Steelers, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2088.58s)]
*  whose defense ended up being just average. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2089.86s)]
*  But I was thinking, wow, if they can't stop Lamar, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2093.66s)]
*  if this can't be like a 17-15 type game [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2096.02s)]
*  that they're used to, forget it. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2098.5s)]
*  Who the hell is gonna do it? [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2100.02s)]
*  Allen had a play in the first half [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2101.74s)]
*  when he was going around the corner [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2103.4199999999996s)]
*  and the guy knew what he was doing. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2104.9399999999996s)]
*  I think it was a third down [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2108.14s)]
*  and the guy basically beat him to the spot. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2109.18s)]
*  And Allen just went around him, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2111.2999999999997s)]
*  went down the sideline and got eight, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2113.4199999999996s)]
*  took a guy on, knocked him over too. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2115.2999999999997s)]
*  Instead of kind of bounce. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2117.2999999999997s)]
*  Defender put his jersey down over the puddle [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2118.14s)]
*  so that Allen could step over it. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2120.46s)]
*  And it's getting ridiculous. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2123.38s)]
*  But it's just, both of those guys just have these, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2124.74s)]
*  oh my God, how do you stop this? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2127.94s)]
*  Now Baltimore might not have Zay Flowers next week. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2130.18s)]
*  That's not nothing. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2133.34s)]
*  Buffalo seems like they have their full team [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2134.62s)]
*  and they really feel like they've, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2136.42s)]
*  I don't know where they got this offensive line from [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2138.7799999999997s)]
*  that we did a lot of prep before the year. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2141.1s)]
*  I remember liking certain things about their team [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2144.06s)]
*  and definitely they had, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2146.06s)]
*  an offensive line was one of the strengths. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2147.42s)]
*  Now it feels like one of the best three offensive lines [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2149.18s)]
*  in the league. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2151.2599999999998s)]
*  And James Cook is very good and they don't rely on one guy. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2153.1800000000003s)]
*  It's not Stefan Diggs. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2156.82s)]
*  Like, oh, you don't get him the ball. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2158.02s)]
*  He's gonna be mad and he's your nut. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2159.34s)]
*  No, you look at the box score. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2160.7400000000002s)]
*  They'll end up having like eight pass catchers. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2162.82s)]
*  Yeah, he's had like 15 touchdown catchers this year. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2165.5s)]
*  I guess the difference is Baltimore is built [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2168.1800000000003s)]
*  to stop the run. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2170.06s)]
*  They're really good at it. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2171.06s)]
*  I think they're number one in the league. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2171.9s)]
*  Buffalo is not. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2173.7000000000003s)]
*  So if you're gonna say, all right, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2175.7000000000003s)]
*  both of these teams are gonna go bully ball, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2177.42s)]
*  I think Baltimore has a better chance [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2179.02s)]
*  of doing it. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2181.4599999999996s)]
*  Baltimore yesterday, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2182.2999999999997s)]
*  as they broke Pittsburgh's spirit completely and totally, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2183.14s)]
*  they had that 13 run, 85 yard touchdown drive [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2185.7799999999997s)]
*  where they did not pass, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2188.3799999999997s)]
*  which is just a fuck you. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2189.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2191.3399999999997s)]
*  Honestly. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2192.18s)]
*  That's just, you're just pulling it out at that point [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2193.8599999999997s)]
*  and just waving it around like a fucking last time. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2195.8999999999996s)]
*  It's like 13 runs in a row. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2199.02s)]
*  Hey, hey, hey, hey, top of the head, have some of this. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2201.66s)]
*  Like it's such a fuck you. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2204.74s)]
*  It really is. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2206.74s)]
*  Like not one pass. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2207.58s)]
*  That's just like, you're like, let's break these guys. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2209.46s)]
*  They're off, hey, he's telling Harbaugh like, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2211.86s)]
*  hey, I was thinking about just calling runs over [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2214.94s)]
*  and over again until we score just to fuck these guys. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2217.62s)]
*  He's like, yeah, do it, go for it. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2220.86s)]
*  So. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2224.3s)]
*  It worked. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2225.14s)]
*  And Tomlin, I don't know, I mean, that's six games [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2225.98s)]
*  and in the playoffs, he's gone down by 21 or more. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2227.58s)]
*  Like, I don't know what you think about this guy. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2230.66s)]
*  And then I look at the quarterback situation, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2232.7400000000002s)]
*  it's like, this team doesn't have a chance [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2234.38s)]
*  unless the moon ball to Pickens works. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2236.02s)]
*  That's the word, like four times a game now [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2238.38s)]
*  for them to even have any kind of chance. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2240.58s)]
*  Well, we were betting on them over and over again [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2242.42s)]
*  and they were overachieving, looking great. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2244.3s)]
*  And the Philly game was when it turned. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2246.38s)]
*  They got their asses kicked by Philly and we all sat up, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2248.82s)]
*  stayed at the craps table, a game too long on that one. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2251.58s)]
*  It felt like that three days and 11 days, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2254.58s)]
*  three games in 11 days kind of broke them. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2256.98s)]
*  I was thinking about possible excuses for them. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2259.3s)]
*  The three days and 11 days somehow didn't break Baltimore [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2262.6600000000003s)]
*  or Casey or Houston, they all like gained strength a bit. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2265.46s)]
*  But I guess Pittsburgh could blame it. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2267.58s)]
*  Russell Wilson maybe is like a house guest [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2270.02s)]
*  that just kind of stays too long. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2273.1s)]
*  It's like fun to have in the guest room for two months. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2276.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2280.1s)]
*  Month three, just leaving the fridge open [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2280.94s)]
*  and you're like, oh man, this guy. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2283.86s)]
*  Yeah, gotta get off the couch. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2285.5s)]
*  Tomlin, 18 years, the 18 year itch. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2288.02s)]
*  I don't know if that's, is that a thing? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2291.38s)]
*  I think it is, yeah, look it up. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2293.06s)]
*  Here's the thing I noticed though. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2295.2599999999998s)]
*  I have one more I could add to that. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2296.86s)]
*  Yeah, let's hear it. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2298.66s)]
*  Yeah, you called them the best AFC team [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2299.5s)]
*  back like December 2nd or so. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2301.7799999999997s)]
*  That might be another one. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2303.5s)]
*  They were, they were the one seed. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2304.34s)]
*  No, come on. Was that wrong? [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2306.06s)]
*  Yeah, you were wrong, yeah, come on. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2307.7s)]
*  Well, in the moment was that wrong? [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2310.06s)]
*  Sure, yeah. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2312.54s)]
*  My whole point was they're the best team right now. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2313.38s)]
*  December or whatever. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2316.46s)]
*  They weren't better than Buffalo. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2318.1s)]
*  I believed. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2319.42s)]
*  I mean, all right, okay, it's fine, I'm not blaming you. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2320.2599999999998s)]
*  But yeah, it's fine. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2323.14s)]
*  I'm gonna wipe my tears with my, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2324.46s)]
*  I went 27 and five and over under his handkerchief. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2326.02s)]
*  Oh wow, you have that? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2328.66s)]
*  So I looked at their last six playoff losses for Pittsburgh. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2330.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2336.3s)]
*  Gave up 36 points to the Pats, 45 to the Jaguars, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2337.98s)]
*  48 to the Browns, 42 to the Chiefs, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2342.58s)]
*  31 to Buffalo last week, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2347.14s)]
*  and then 28 to the Ravens this week, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2349.7s)]
*  which really could have been more [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2352.1s)]
*  if the Ravens wanted to score more. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2353.1s)]
*  Tom was supposed to be this awesome defensive coach. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2355.06s)]
*  We always talk about the ugly 18 to 16 games [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2359.42s)]
*  and then January just goes away. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2362.1s)]
*  What happens? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2364.1s)]
*  I don't know, but I also know they don't have the luxury [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2365.86s)]
*  of what the Patriots did, right? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2368.8199999999997s)]
*  Because they're not ever gonna be in a position [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2370.42s)]
*  to draft a great quarterback, right? [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2372.42s)]
*  So if as long as the streak gets, oh my God, he did it. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2375.5s)]
*  They went over eight and a half wins again. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2378.54s)]
*  You went on that, that's great. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2380.2599999999998s)]
*  And then it's a first round exit in the playoffs. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2382.02s)]
*  That's not gonna change anytime soon, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2384.7s)]
*  but now you're right, the margins are getting thick. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2386.3s)]
*  The season is just too long for them. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2390.06s)]
*  They're losing by too many points in the playoffs. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2391.54s)]
*  I don't know what happens to that guy. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2394.46s)]
*  I don't know what happened to their defense. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2396.1s)]
*  I thought the first two months, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2398.42s)]
*  I thought they had the best defense in the league. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2399.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2402.06s)]
*  As DJ Watt got hurt at one point [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2402.9s)]
*  and it never felt like he was totally the same. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2404.94s)]
*  They had some secondary injuries, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2407.06s)]
*  but the first two months, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2408.46s)]
*  they were like the flying around defense. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2410.9s)]
*  Who was calling them out? [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2412.82s)]
*  Who was the announcer for that Pittsburgh game? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2414.94s)]
*  It was not Collinsworth. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2417.26s)]
*  This week? [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2418.78s)]
*  Oh, it's Herbstreet. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2419.62s)]
*  Herbstreet, yeah. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2420.62s)]
*  He's not exactly like Mr. Supercritical. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2423.2200000000003s)]
*  He was like calling them out in the first half. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2425.9s)]
*  It's like, it's a playoff game. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2427.94s)]
*  Where's the fight from this team? [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2429.38s)]
*  Make a play, you kept saying. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2430.58s)]
*  Something weird happened. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2432.18s)]
*  I don't know what happened with this team, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2433.38s)]
*  but whatever we saw the last five weeks [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2434.9s)]
*  was not what we saw in the first three months from them. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2437.18s)]
*  Yeah, I don't want to say he's losing the locker room, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2439.8999999999996s)]
*  but this is the closest it looks to that in a long time. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2441.7799999999997s)]
*  Would you trade Mike McCarthy [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2445.8999999999996s)]
*  in a second round pick for him? [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2447.3399999999997s)]
*  I gotta say, I was a little annoyed [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2449.58s)]
*  that the Patriots signed Vrebl. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2451.58s)]
*  I'm like, oh man, Tomlin could be available for them. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2453.18s)]
*  They just waited like 48 hours. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2455.8999999999996s)]
*  And yes. For the Pats? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2458.4199999999996s)]
*  Yes, for the Patriots. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2459.74s)]
*  The Steelers, they famously only had three coaches [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2461.14s)]
*  in 130 years or whatever the thing is. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2463.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2466.86s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2468.1800000000003s)]
*  I think they go in for the, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2469.02s)]
*  after the season meeting with the owner [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2469.94s)]
*  and they're like, what happened this year, Mike? [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2471.6600000000003s)]
*  And he's like, I don't know our quarter, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2473.2200000000003s)]
*  we paid $3 million for our quarterbacks. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2474.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2477.1400000000003s)]
*  That I won 10 games. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2477.98s)]
*  So what's the quarterback situation? [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2479.06s)]
*  Not that I care too much, but what possibly can you do? [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2481.54s)]
*  I know what I would do. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2484.7400000000002s)]
*  I would trade the first pick for McCarthy. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2485.58s)]
*  But then you still have Russell Wilson [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2488.7400000000002s)]
*  or Justin Fields and McCarthy. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2490.94s)]
*  No, no, not, I'm saying JJ McCarthy. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2493.1800000000003s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2496.94s)]
*  All right. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2497.78s)]
*  Yeah, not Mike McCarthy. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2498.62s)]
*  I was like, what? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2499.94s)]
*  I didn't trade a ninth round pick for Mike McCarthy. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2500.78s)]
*  I know it's been a tough week, Bill, but what? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2502.62s)]
*  No. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2503.94s)]
*  This is a, all right. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2504.78s)]
*  No, I would trade for JJ McCarthy. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2505.86s)]
*  I got you. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2507.9s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2508.9s)]
*  Now, if Darnold shits the bet again tomorrow, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2509.78s)]
*  he might not be available anymore. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2511.94s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2513.54s)]
*  Darnold could go from two weeks ago, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2514.62s)]
*  we were talking about why won't they just pay him now [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2516.5s)]
*  and now two weeks, if he sucks again, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2519.9s)]
*  and be like, oh, well, at least they have JJ McCarthy. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2521.7400000000002s)]
*  There's not a ton of options for them. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2523.82s)]
*  That's not a bad thought. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2525.58s)]
*  The other guy they could trade for Joe Milton, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2528.34s)]
*  I'll send him some week 18 Buffalo Pats game tape. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2530.14s)]
*  Joe Milton lighting up the Bill's second string, [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2533.98s)]
*  pretending, he could pretend it was the first string. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2536.22s)]
*  Chargers, Texans. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2539.3s)]
*  Chargers. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2541.82s)]
*  This was beyond shaky, right? [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2542.66s)]
*  This was, we don't, haven't gone in a while, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2543.86s)]
*  but if we did, like people would be chucking [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2546.66s)]
*  their mojo potatoes at the screen for the first hour [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2548.46s)]
*  and the manager would threaten to turn the game to rerun. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2551.3s)]
*  It was AI shakies. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2556.06s)]
*  It was AI created a shaky broadcast. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2557.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2561.14s)]
*  Six nothing, Chargers are up after they just gave away [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2561.98s)]
*  possible touchdowns on two straight drives. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2565.22s)]
*  The Texans are an absolute mess. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2567.2599999999998s)]
*  Third and 16, they snap the ball over Stroud's head. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2570.14s)]
*  And it seems like it's either gonna be a safety, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2573.7s)]
*  a touchdown, something great. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2575.8199999999997s)]
*  This is right after the intentional grounding, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2578.3399999999997s)]
*  they don't call. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2580.06s)]
*  And he picks it up, rolls out, everyone's Chargers stops, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2581.66s)]
*  throws it to midfield and immediately turns it [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2584.54s)]
*  into a different quarterback. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2586.62s)]
*  And from that point on, the Texans never look back. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2587.58s)]
*  I, my best bet was the Texans over 19 and a half. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2590.7000000000003s)]
*  And you were making fun of me, like, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2593.78s)]
*  how's your Texans over three and a half points looking? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2594.98s)]
*  And I, I deserved it. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2597.62s)]
*  They were terrible. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2599.7400000000002s)]
*  I still don't think I picked the right side. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2600.58s)]
*  They won 32 to 12 and I still don't think I got it right. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2602.02s)]
*  I don't know if there was a right side. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2604.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh, I think it was two wrong sides. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2606.62s)]
*  And Herbert's so weird because he'll throw a 22 yard [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2608.7400000000002s)]
*  completion to McConkie. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2611.5s)]
*  And I'm like, wow, that's the best throw of a football. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2612.7s)]
*  I've seen in a long time. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2614.8599999999997s)]
*  What a cannon. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2616.7s)]
*  Yeah. Four interceptions later. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2617.66s)]
*  I think we were going to rank his top 10 bad passes, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2619.3799999999997s)]
*  but they ended up too many. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2622.22s)]
*  We can't get to it. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2624.18s)]
*  So was that for you, is that a Houston is so resilient [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2625.7799999999997s)]
*  there that nobody believes in us game? [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2631.7s)]
*  Or is that a, we might never get there [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2634.74s)]
*  with Justin Herbert game. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2637.18s)]
*  Oh man. I think it, can I say both? [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2638.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm not allowed to say both. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2640.4199999999996s)]
*  You can say both. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2641.74s)]
*  I'm going to say Houston, primarily Houston. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2643.1s)]
*  And they scared me last year. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2645.8199999999997s)]
*  Remember that's what sent me on a tailspin. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2647.1s)]
*  Some others when we bet against them, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2648.9799999999996s)]
*  thought the Browns were better team last year, right? [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2651.14s)]
*  When they went to Houston and Houston throttled them. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2653.3799999999997s)]
*  I was like, you know what the chargers tend to have? [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2656.22s)]
*  I mean, now you've got this quarterback [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2658.8599999999997s)]
*  going back to Herbert. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2660.66s)]
*  He's had, what does he have? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2662.7799999999997s)]
*  Like two teams that had three interceptions [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2664.3799999999997s)]
*  and he couldn't, the three turnovers [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2667.02s)]
*  and he couldn't beat them. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2668.54s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2669.66s)]
*  Everything was going their way [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2670.94s)]
*  and he still couldn't close the game. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2672.54s)]
*  Five years, zero playoff wins. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2675.18s)]
*  He's three games over 500. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2678.58s)]
*  To include the playoff games, he's one game over 500. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2681.02s)]
*  I was actually researching quarterbacks [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2684.82s)]
*  who never won a playoff game. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2686.94s)]
*  And the best one ever is Y.A. Tittle. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2688.7000000000003s)]
*  He never won one, huh? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2692.18s)]
*  Never won one. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2693.26s)]
*  As much as we heard about him. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2694.1s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2694.94s)]
*  Had some, was in some big spots, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2696.1s)]
*  apparently never won one. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2698.42s)]
*  And then Andy Dalton was the other one. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2699.38s)]
*  Andy Dalton never won a shaky's game? [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2702.2200000000003s)]
*  Never won. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2704.46s)]
*  Oh, over five. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2705.46s)]
*  But the famous one was Stafford. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2708.42s)]
*  First 12 years, oh and three in the playoffs. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2710.42s)]
*  Never won anything. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2712.38s)]
*  So maybe this is a Stafford type thing, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2713.34s)]
*  but it's really unusual for a guy this talented [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2716.02s)]
*  to not win. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2719.5s)]
*  So you have that. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2721.06s)]
*  And then you have, you know, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2723.62s)]
*  we used to joke about the DeLome. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2725.06s)]
*  The DeLome was four picks with a fumble. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2727.98s)]
*  And then the DeLome, the full DeLome, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2733.78s)]
*  I think was five picks with a fumble [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2736.46s)]
*  and one of them had to be a pick six [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2738.5s)]
*  or something like that. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2740.18s)]
*  So close, so close. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2741.02s)]
*  I went back and I looked. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2742.34s)]
*  Quarterbacks in the last 50 years [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2744.46s)]
*  with four picks and a fumble in a playoff game. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2749.18s)]
*  And it's only 15. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2752.7s)]
*  And it's 15. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2755.34s)]
*  That's a lot. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2756.42s)]
*  15. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2757.42s)]
*  But think like people used to throw interceptions [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2758.54s)]
*  way more in the old days. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2760.62s)]
*  I didn't think they passed as much, I guess. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2762.46s)]
*  Todd Marinovich had one. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2763.42s)]
*  Jim Kelly, Richard Todd, Joe Ferguson, Tommy Kramer. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2765.5s)]
*  The one we watched together, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2770.66s)]
*  the first Super Bowl we watched together, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2772.38s)]
*  Tampa, Oakland, Rich Gannon, five picks, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2773.7000000000003s)]
*  three pick sixes. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2777.3s)]
*  So that was, I guess the full Gannon is five picks. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2779.02s)]
*  Full Gannon sounds better anyway, I think, yeah. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2783.78s)]
*  So only three guys have thrown five picks [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2785.7799999999997s)]
*  with an interception, DeLome, Gannon, and Kramer. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2788.4599999999996s)]
*  The last two to do it were Brian Hoyer in 2016 [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2791.62s)]
*  and Carson Palmer the same year. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2796.7799999999997s)]
*  Right, I do remember that. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2799.62s)]
*  He did the four with the, he had the pick six. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2800.4599999999996s)]
*  I'll say this about Herbert [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2804.5s)]
*  because I don't want to bury him completely yet. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2806.02s)]
*  But I don't know that Harbaugh's as psyched [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2808.5s)]
*  as he was a year ago, right? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2813.54s)]
*  We could stop the comparisons to Joe Burrell for sure. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2816.58s)]
*  Fine, keep comparing them, the two of that, that's good. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2820.4199999999996s)]
*  But I don't know, if you're Harbaugh, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2822.8599999999997s)]
*  what's your thought process now? [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2825.9799999999996s)]
*  It's like, oh shit, this is gonna take a lot more work [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2827.2999999999997s)]
*  than I thought, right? [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2828.9799999999996s)]
*  I think you move pretty quickly into, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2830.5s)]
*  I gotta get this guy more than one receiver. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2832.2999999999997s)]
*  There's a nerd case for blaming the offensive coordinator [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2835.58s)]
*  and the play calling, but the football nerds [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2838.18s)]
*  love Justin Herbert no matter what he does. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2840.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2843.4199999999996s)]
*  Here's the bigger question to me. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2844.7s)]
*  Quarterbacks you'd rather have for the next eight years [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2847.3799999999997s)]
*  than Justin Herbert. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2852.2999999999997s)]
*  So take it to 2033. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2854.18s)]
*  It's really just a task. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2856.5s)]
*  I'll list them to you and you tell me when to stop. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2857.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2859.94s)]
*  Mahomes, Allen, Lamar, Burrow, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2861.3799999999997s)]
*  take all four of those, right? [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2864.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2865.74s)]
*  Would you take Jaden Daniels? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2866.94s)]
*  Sure, right now, but I'm gonna be hesitant [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2869.62s)]
*  with the whole CJ Stroud thing. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2873.22s)]
*  But yes, right now. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2875.5s)]
*  CJ Stroud? [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2876.66s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2878.98s)]
*  It's a toss up for you. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2880.8199999999997s)]
*  That's close, that's maybe where you got me. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2882.22s)]
*  Wait a minute, there's not more? [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2884.62s)]
*  There is more. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2885.86s)]
*  There's on the top? [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2886.7s)]
*  Drake May? [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2887.54s)]
*  No, come on. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2889.74s)]
*  Come on, let's see a little something else. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2892.54s)]
*  If the charger's off for Justin Herbert, [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2894.62s)]
*  for Drake May, straight up. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2897.7s)]
*  Fuck yeah, what are you talking about? [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2899.54s)]
*  Rather have Drake May in a rookie contract, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2901.86s)]
*  100 times out of 100. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2903.46s)]
*  You're not a good, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2904.94s)]
*  whoever said you were a good businessman? [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2905.78s)]
*  Here's an interesting one. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2907.26s)]
*  Mayfield. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2909.7400000000002s)]
*  How old is Baker? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2912.7000000000003s)]
*  Drake Mayfield or Justin Herbert? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2913.54s)]
*  He's been in the league since what, 2017? [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2914.7000000000003s)]
*  Eight's a lot of years. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2917.98s)]
*  If you told me four or five, I think it's easier. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2919.1s)]
*  So you'd go four years, you'd say yes? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2921.38s)]
*  I think so, yeah, I love Baker. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2923.3s)]
*  DAC, you wouldn't say eight years, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2925.98s)]
*  but if I said four, you would take DAC for four. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2927.86s)]
*  I think I would, yes. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2931.66s)]
*  Darnold? [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2933.94s)]
*  It's so funny how we- Oh, you paused. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2936.58s)]
*  We all have to wait till tomorrow to say. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2938.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2940.46s)]
*  I don't wanna look foolish. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2941.3s)]
*  Yeah, I'd say no, probably. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2943.1800000000003s)]
*  Would you rather have Jared Goff or Justin Herbert? [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2944.46s)]
*  I'd rather have Herbert. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2948.66s)]
*  Herbert, yeah. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2949.62s)]
*  Would you rather have Caleb Williams or Justin Herbert? [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2951.42s)]
*  Herbert right now, why would I, yeah. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2954.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2956.58s)]
*  So that's it. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2957.86s)]
*  The point of that exercise is, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2958.7000000000003s)]
*  as bad as he was in that game, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2960.34s)]
*  and he's never won a playoff game, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2962.5s)]
*  he's still one of the top 10 QB assets, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2964.58s)]
*  no matter what your preference is, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2966.58s)]
*  you're still talking yourself into it. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2968.78s)]
*  Yeah, because well, it'll get you 10 wins, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2970.38s)]
*  and maybe you can get lucky in the playoffs, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2971.7000000000003s)]
*  and they were not lucky or good yesterday. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2973.38s)]
*  I don't love the adversity piece with him. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2977.1s)]
*  Like when, it feels like when the wheels start coming off, [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2981.38s)]
*  it doesn't get better for him. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2985.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2987.7000000000003s)]
*  You know, it feels when it's going good, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2988.54s)]
*  he seems great. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2992.12s)]
*  And then that's a whole other world. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2994.2799999999997s)]
*  Some of those no's, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2996.12s)]
*  I would rather take some of those guys down 10 than Herbert. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=2997.48s)]
*  For sure. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3000.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3001.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3002.56s)]
*  All right, so we're gonna do guess the lines round two. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3003.4s)]
*  We only have three games that have lines. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3005.52s)]
*  We're gonna come back Monday night [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3007.64s)]
*  after Minnesota and the Rams [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3009.92s)]
*  and do a little short, maybe 25 minute pod, [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3011.7599999999998s)]
*  where we talk about the game and then guess the line, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3015.0s)]
*  because we like to guess every line. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3016.88s)]
*  It's not our fault they changed, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3018.3599999999997s)]
*  made it a three day round one. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3019.8399999999997s)]
*  I love doing the pod with you, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3022.12s)]
*  but yeah, it was a little tidier [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3023.7999999999997s)]
*  when everything was done by Sunday night. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3025.7999999999997s)]
*  And also make that game in Vegas. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3027.7599999999998s)]
*  Move everything, when in doubt, move everything to Vegas. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3030.9199999999996s)]
*  What's Glendale? [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3034.08s)]
*  Which game? [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3035.2s)]
*  Oh, the Rams Vikings. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3036.16s)]
*  Yeah, why isn't that in Vegas? [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3038.56s)]
*  It's an easier drive to Vegas if you're in LA. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3040.64s)]
*  If it's a football game, if it's a bachelor party, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3043.8799999999997s)]
*  if it's an intervention, just move it to Vegas. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3046.3199999999997s)]
*  It's an easy thought. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3049.32s)]
*  Get it out there. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3051.2400000000002s)]
*  They love Glendale. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3052.0800000000004s)]
*  They love how middle of the road [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3052.92s)]
*  between the two teams it is for some reason. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3054.96s)]
*  It's like, if we put it in Arizona, it's perfectly neutral. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3057.96s)]
*  The NFL just feels like it's the most [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3061.0800000000004s)]
*  neutral territory possible. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3062.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3064.2400000000002s)]
*  It's just, this is not the first time they've went [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3065.0800000000004s)]
*  to Glendale. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3067.48s)]
*  I'm with you, why not go to Vegas? [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3068.32s)]
*  Go to Vegas, yeah. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3069.6400000000003s)]
*  Okay, I'll do the AFC games first. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3072.52s)]
*  All right. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3076.2400000000002s)]
*  Chiefs Texans in Kansas City. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3078.08s)]
*  The only reason I was scared of Houston in that, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3084.3199999999997s)]
*  I really like the Chargers in that Chargers game. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3087.04s)]
*  Houston had a whiff of Nobody Believes in Us. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3090.0s)]
*  And then you look at them more and you're like, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3093.12s)]
*  there's a reason nobody believes in you. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3096.16s)]
*  You guys have sucked. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3098.2799999999997s)]
*  Like, the only things that would make anyone believe in you [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3099.6s)]
*  are the models on home underdogs during the playoffs [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3103.76s)]
*  and some of the stuff housed in on the show. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3107.76s)]
*  Like, there's gambling nerd metrics [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3109.92s)]
*  that we should believe in you. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3113.48s)]
*  But from what we've watched from a football standpoint, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3114.52s)]
*  you guys have sucked. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3116.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3118.52s)]
*  So I don't feel bad about missing that [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3119.36s)]
*  as a Nobody Believes in Us, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3120.72s)]
*  but in this game, it's gonna kick up. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3121.8s)]
*  There's always like a two and a half line [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3123.68s)]
*  that they screw you with, right? [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3125.56s)]
*  Like, oh, I just have to pick the winner here? [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3127.68s)]
*  The Chargers are better than the Texans. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3129.48s)]
*  So, but until that was the one. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3131.16s)]
*  You know, the thing with that game though, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3133.48s)]
*  I really thought the Chargers offensive line [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3134.96s)]
*  was gonna be able to handle the edge rushers on Houston. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3136.96s)]
*  They have good tackles. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3139.8s)]
*  And yet over and over again, [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3141.76s)]
*  Houston was coming on the edge [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3143.08s)]
*  and they completely disrupted them. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3145.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3147.08s)]
*  I just pegged it wrong. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3147.92s)]
*  Anyway, Chiefs Texans, I have Chiefs by nine. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3149.92s)]
*  All right, don't get mad, but I hit this exactly. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3154.64s)]
*  Seven and a half. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3157.08s)]
*  Wow. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3159.2400000000002s)]
*  That's what I said. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3160.08s)]
*  So I jacked it up because I thought they would not want us [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3161.92s)]
*  to tease the Chiefs. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3165.92s)]
*  And I thought they'd put it at nine [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3169.12s)]
*  so that even if you tease them, [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3170.52s)]
*  you still had Chiefs minus three. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3171.84s)]
*  Chiefs seven and a half, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3173.7200000000003s)]
*  they're basically opening the floodgates for a tease. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3174.6800000000003s)]
*  They've done a weird, disrespectful thing [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3178.32s)]
*  for the Chiefs in their lines, you know, [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3180.4s)]
*  as much as they can for a 15-win team. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3182.6s)]
*  And they've kind of done it all season long. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3185.36s)]
*  The big thing I'm hearing is, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3187.7200000000003s)]
*  it seems like it's a disadvantage. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3189.88s)]
*  And Fandl is also treating it as a disadvantage [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3192.48s)]
*  that they've been off for two weeks. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3195.28s)]
*  Like, oh, the Chiefs are off two weeks [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3196.6400000000003s)]
*  and they didn't play anyone week 18. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3198.36s)]
*  So that's really two weeks. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3200.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, they do this every year. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3201.4s)]
*  And they win the Super Bowl like every other year. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3202.92s)]
*  So why? [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3204.8s)]
*  Yeah, they have a lot of infrastructure. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3205.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, why are we going crazy about it? [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3206.7200000000003s)]
*  I can understand it after week 12, week 13 range [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3207.88s)]
*  when we were really worried about the Chiefs [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3210.8s)]
*  and it really felt like, what were they, 12 and one? [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3212.7200000000003s)]
*  It felt like they could have been easily eight and five [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3215.28s)]
*  or seven and six with five different plays. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3217.52s)]
*  I like the way they ended the season up until [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3220.2400000000002s)]
*  when they didn't have to play anymore. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3222.44s)]
*  I thought they were more explosive. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3223.76s)]
*  I thought Pacheco was, once he came back, [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3227.48s)]
*  they run the ball better. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3230.16s)]
*  I just liked how they looked more. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3231.0s)]
*  And I think they're delighted in this matchup, honestly. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3232.48s)]
*  I don't think they want, you know, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3235.4s)]
*  they wouldn't have been afraid of Harbaugh, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3236.52s)]
*  but the Chargers played him well twice. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3237.96s)]
*  I think they had a two-point loss and a seven-point loss [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3239.64s)]
*  and Harbaugh going to Kansas. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3241.84s)]
*  You know, I think Andy Reid gets a little freaked out there, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3243.68s)]
*  but they'll slap this team around, I think. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3246.48s)]
*  The only case would be the Houston pass rush again. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3249.44s)]
*  Casey's tackles aren't great. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3254.0s)]
*  Some sort of dumb Casey first half [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3256.8s)]
*  where they have three points, you know, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3259.36s)]
*  20 minutes into the game. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3261.44s)]
*  And then Mixon pounding the ball down their throw. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3263.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3269.04s)]
*  Listen. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3270.16s)]
*  I'm teasing the Chiefs. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3271.0s)]
*  I'm just telling you. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3272.0s)]
*  You and I, I know it's been a rough week. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3272.84s)]
*  You and I and your financial planner, [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3274.72s)]
*  we're going to sit down Tuesday, Wednesday-ish, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3276.68s)]
*  and we're going to figure out how much you want to put [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3278.9599999999996s)]
*  on the Chiefs, Ohio State, Moneyline, Parlay. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3280.9199999999996s)]
*  And so you're... [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3283.9599999999996s)]
*  Oh, you're still in on Ohio State. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3284.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3286.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's easy. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3287.3599999999997s)]
*  So let's just do it and not have to worry about anything. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3288.2s)]
*  You're not afraid of Notre Dame? [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3290.2799999999997s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3292.3199999999997s)]
*  It's mismatch. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3293.9199999999996s)]
*  It's mismatch up front. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3295.2799999999997s)]
*  They can get bullied. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3296.7599999999998s)]
*  Anyway, Bill's Ravens is our second game. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3299.04s)]
*  I had this all week battling back and forth [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3303.2400000000002s)]
*  between minus two and a half, minus three. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3306.76s)]
*  And I think I'm wrong, but I have the Bills in Buffalo [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3308.52s)]
*  favored by three against the Baltimore Ravens. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3314.52s)]
*  It's exactly what I thought. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3318.36s)]
*  And I stand by it. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3320.44s)]
*  Our friends at Fandl have the Bills [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3322.96s)]
*  only favored by one and a half. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3324.8s)]
*  Ooh, the Tic Tac Zone. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3327.2400000000002s)]
*  Yep. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3329.56s)]
*  Did we see a little flipperoo? [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3330.4s)]
*  Oh, you think the Ravens will get the nod? [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3332.7200000000003s)]
*  I just, every time we're in the 1.5 Tic Tac Zone, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3334.84s)]
*  sometimes by Wednesday, all of a sudden it's like, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3339.4s)]
*  wait a second, Baltimore's favored in Buffalo now. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3341.6s)]
*  Can we talk about what this means? [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3345.56s)]
*  Like why, how they may have arrived at this? [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3347.12s)]
*  Because it doesn't really make sense to me. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3349.88s)]
*  Maybe they arrived the same way. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3353.04s)]
*  I've kind of arrived mentally. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3354.56s)]
*  I like the Ravens. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3356.04s)]
*  You do? [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3357.48s)]
*  I do. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3358.36s)]
*  I, [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3359.8399999999997s)]
*  I forgot to do this before. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3361.56s)]
*  I had this Derek Henry thing I was gonna do with you. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3363.16s)]
*  Go ahead, let's do it. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3366.12s)]
*  Which quarterback would you want over Derek Henry? [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3367.52s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3370.48s)]
*  I was looking up, I was trying to think of how many guys [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3371.3199999999997s)]
*  were awesome from like the first moment they played [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3374.56s)]
*  in high school all the way through. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3377.64s)]
*  And they're still awesome now. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3380.9199999999996s)]
*  Like I think LeBron's been like that, right? [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3382.7599999999998s)]
*  LeBron was awesome as a ninth grader all the way through. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3384.52s)]
*  He's been awesome for 26 years. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3387.56s)]
*  Henry, as a freshman in high school at Uly in 2009, [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3391.08s)]
*  rushed for 2,465 yards and 7.9 yards of carry. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3396.96s)]
*  He was like 14 years old. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3401.0s)]
*  He finished his career. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3402.92s)]
*  He ran for 12,124 yards in high school, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3404.44s)]
*  8.7 yards per carry and 153 touchdowns, right? [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3407.88s)]
*  So he's, I don't know if he's the greatest [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3411.92s)]
*  high school running back ever, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3414.0s)]
*  but if they, whenever anybody writes that article, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3415.08s)]
*  he has to be one of the first people mentioned. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3418.52s)]
*  It's like Emmett Smith and you go through, [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3419.36s)]
*  you have to have Henry in the first couple. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3421.0s)]
*  Well, week nine against Norwich his junior year, [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3423.0s)]
*  he says he had the flu, but he only went for like 130. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3425.72s)]
*  So then he goes to Alabama, they're stacked up running back. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3429.08s)]
*  He plays anyway, second year better. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3432.84s)]
*  And then third year, 2,219 yards, 5.6 of carry, turns pro. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3436.84s)]
*  And he's rushed for 11,423 yards in nine years. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3441.84s)]
*  He's had three years where he ran for over five yards [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3446.84s)]
*  of carry and then another year he was 4.9. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3450.2400000000002s)]
*  This last year he ran for 5.9 of carry in 1921. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3452.76s)]
*  It's the second best year of his career. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3456.2000000000003s)]
*  There's nobody like him. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3458.56s)]
*  He's a complete 101. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3459.6800000000003s)]
*  We've never seen a running back [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3461.08s)]
*  who does the things that he does. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3462.6000000000004s)]
*  I can't compare him to anybody we've ever, [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3464.28s)]
*  like there's pieces of like Christian McCoy [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3467.2400000000002s)]
*  Eric Dickerson, I don't know who he is. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3469.48s)]
*  And he's exactly as good as he was when he came in the league. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3471.6800000000003s)]
*  And I don't know how long it continues, [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3475.2400000000002s)]
*  but it's weird that we had that one playoffs [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3476.88s)]
*  when we talked about him, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3479.36s)]
*  when the Titans were like nine and eight or nine and seven, [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3480.2000000000003s)]
*  and then they made it all the way to the AFC title game. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3483.52s)]
*  And it was like, oh my God, [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3485.44s)]
*  is Derek Henry more valuable than any quarterback? [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3486.6000000000004s)]
*  And that was the only time he had a moment in the sun. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3488.84s)]
*  And now you watch him, especially in that playoff game. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3491.84s)]
*  And it's like, are we just going to let him go? [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3494.48s)]
*  And it's like, are we just completely underrated Baltimore? [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3497.52s)]
*  And is this Lamar Henry thing? [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3501.64s)]
*  Are we going to look back at this [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3503.16s)]
*  and think this was one of the most amazing combos [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3504.36s)]
*  we've had in the league this century? [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3506.6s)]
*  Anyway, that's why I like the Ravens. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3509.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, I think you could be right about all that stuff. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3511.56s)]
*  I mean, it's amazing. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3514.12s)]
*  A guy does so well in high school [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3514.96s)]
*  that he's drafted in college and he does so well in college. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3516.52s)]
*  I'm just saying, but how are you this great [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3519.12s)]
*  as a running back for 15 straight years? [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3522.4s)]
*  But his charge for carry went down a couple of those years. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3524.96s)]
*  But he's unstoppable. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3527.28s)]
*  I get it. He's still on site. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3528.48s)]
*  He was unstoppable as a freshman in high school. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3529.96s)]
*  Fifteen years later, nobody could stop him. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3531.6800000000003s)]
*  Like, it's amazing. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3533.6400000000003s)]
*  Listen, I should walk or slow down. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3534.44s)]
*  Fandl had Saturday highest rushing yards on Saturday. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3536.88s)]
*  I was like, it's Derek Henry. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3541.36s)]
*  Why is it minus 125? [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3542.6800000000003s)]
*  JJ is arguing with me. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3544.1600000000003s)]
*  I was like, just stop. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3545.36s)]
*  Just bet Derek Henry to have the most yards on Saturday. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3546.5600000000004s)]
*  He's going to have the most yards for the weekend. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3549.4s)]
*  And he ended up 186, 186 or something. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3551.5600000000004s)]
*  So, yeah, he's great. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3554.2000000000003s)]
*  They're great. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3555.84s)]
*  The only thing is, I don't know, like they have to... [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3556.44s)]
*  Sometimes they don't figure out how to manage the load [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3559.64s)]
*  between Lamar and Henry. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3562.88s)]
*  Sometimes. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3564.6s)]
*  He's 4'9 per carry for his career. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3565.96s)]
*  And then 5'0 in the postseason. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3570.04s)]
*  Usually we always talk about running backs. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3573.6s)]
*  It's like a shelf life of four years, five years, maybe six years. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3575.6s)]
*  This guy's going to... [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3579.2000000000003s)]
*  He's floating around in free agency and people are like, [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3580.92s)]
*  I might be too old. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3582.76s)]
*  And it turned out he was just on a team that didn't have [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3583.8s)]
*  quarterbacks for four years. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3585.68s)]
*  I think this guy is one of the all time freaks. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3587.44s)]
*  Like, I think Moss was a freak. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3590.7999999999997s)]
*  I think Lawrence Taylor was a freak. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3592.8799999999997s)]
*  We talk about like the freak athletes that we've watched [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3594.48s)]
*  since we've been alive and love football. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3596.8799999999997s)]
*  And Henry, it's a short list, but he's definitely on it. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3599.3199999999997s)]
*  I thought we're just... [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3603.16s)]
*  He's a one on one to me. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3603.96s)]
*  I'm not going to argue. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3604.96s)]
*  I will have to see his like stats in Turkey Bowl when those parents [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3605.68s)]
*  played him and when he was like nine years old and stuff. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3609.56s)]
*  But I'll trust you. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3612.2s)]
*  Cedar year. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3613.0s)]
*  13 games. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3613.8799999999997s)]
*  4,261 yards. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3614.96s)]
*  Wow. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3617.4s)]
*  He ran for 4,000 yards. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3618.2s)]
*  Sign him up. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3619.44s)]
*  I know, it's stupid. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3620.2s)]
*  It's really dumb. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3621.32s)]
*  Yeah, he's got a lot of wear and tear on him. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3622.2400000000002s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3624.7200000000003s)]
*  Or he doesn't. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3626.36s)]
*  Or he has no wear and tear because he's a freak. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3627.28s)]
*  Maybe he keeps going. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3629.56s)]
*  But it doesn't. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3630.48s)]
*  Like you see, there's like the videos of Lamar from high school [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3631.04s)]
*  where he has like a couple of just freaky, you know, [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3634.08s)]
*  he has that one that run into the end zone where he just stops [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3638.16s)]
*  and the guy goes by him and he just pauses and then he goes in. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3641.0s)]
*  And it's just like some of these dudes, they just had it when they were 14. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3644.48s)]
*  Then there's the late bloomer types, even Cooper Dejan. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3648.7200000000003s)]
*  Have you seen the basketball footage of him? [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3652.0s)]
*  Like two hand slams. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3653.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3656.28s)]
*  These guys are good athletes. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3656.7200000000003s)]
*  These guys are good athletes. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3658.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm glad you're learning that. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3659.2400000000002s)]
*  I still think one and a half's light. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3661.4s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3663.52s)]
*  Now, I just think Henry is one of the all time freaks [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3664.12s)]
*  since we've been watching football. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3666.88s)]
*  I would put him at the top, top, top freak level of all these dudes. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3669.0s)]
*  And I wonder, is he the key guy in round two? [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3675.28s)]
*  Not the reason I brought that up. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3678.88s)]
*  Is he the key guy in round two? [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3680.12s)]
*  Not Lamar, because the bills, they're medium sized. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3681.36s)]
*  They're not big. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3684.6s)]
*  I do feel like you can batter and ran them and he just softens them up. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3686.0s)]
*  And then Lamar can do his stuff. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3690.4s)]
*  But why did you make this line three? [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3691.8s)]
*  If you like Baltimore so much, I was just trying to guess what Vegas would have. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3693.36s)]
*  I think Vegas really likes the bills. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3697.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3699.96s)]
*  Where does the line end up? [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3701.64s)]
*  You think you're going Ravens? [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3702.68s)]
*  As soon as we hang this zoom up, you're putting the Ravens on a teaser with somebody. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3704.3199999999997s)]
*  I know you are. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3708.68s)]
*  To me, I want to bet them straight up because there's still the Lamar playoff stuff [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3709.2799999999997s)]
*  still makes me a whiff nervous. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3714.2s)]
*  So I wouldn't want to tie it with another bet. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3716.64s)]
*  I'd rather tease the Chiefs with one of the NFC teams. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3718.3199999999997s)]
*  Mack Hollins had 13 touchdown receptions in high school. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3722.6s)]
*  As a played varsity in ninth grade. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3727.12s)]
*  4,241 yards. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3729.3999999999996s)]
*  It's preposterous. I know it's crazy. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3731.8399999999997s)]
*  I just think and he never get I guess he got he got hurt for like eight games one year [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3733.7599999999998s)]
*  on Tennessee, but there's just no wear and tear at all. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3738.64s)]
*  It's like he's like a car that has 200,000 miles on it that can still go 200 miles an hour. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3741.7599999999998s)]
*  If he went to our son's high school, we'd be talking about him so much. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3746.64s)]
*  Our kids would hate us. Right. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3749.8399999999997s)]
*  Like, shut up, dad. Pay attention to me. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3751.2s)]
*  It's like, yeah, but you got a running back in your school who ran for 4,300 yards. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3752.96s)]
*  So I say I was on a text about this this week and I was saying it's like the kid in the [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3756.52s)]
*  Little League World Series game, the Cody Webster kid who's just bigger than everybody else. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3760.72s)]
*  Right. And then that kid grows up and he's that's the highlight of his life. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3765.12s)]
*  Right. Derrick Henry was probably that kid at age eight. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3768.68s)]
*  And he's still that guy now. He's 30. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3771.3999999999996s)]
*  He's been that guy for over two decades. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3774.0s)]
*  He still looks like you watch and you go, how's anyone tackling this? [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3775.8399999999997s)]
*  All right. Third game, Detroit. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3779.3999999999996s)]
*  Home. For Washington. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3782.12s)]
*  Yeah. You know where this is going. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3785.2799999999997s)]
*  It's going right in the Vegas zone for me. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3791.08s)]
*  Detroit by five and a half. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3793.16s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3794.8399999999997s)]
*  I said seven and a half and it's eight and a half. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3799.16s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3803.16s)]
*  All right. You're going to beat me this week. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3805.52s)]
*  Wait a minute. Do we even have to do guess the lines tomorrow? [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3806.72s)]
*  Yeah, we do. We still have to do for posterity. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3809.08s)]
*  You don't have to start your guys. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3812.3999999999996s)]
*  You can you can be like when the Chiefs rest. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3813.72s)]
*  I'm a rest. Yeah. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3815.8399999999997s)]
*  You can look up some Derrick Henry high school footage. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3817.44s)]
*  You can go over that somewhere. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3819.88s)]
*  Some of his games that you leave. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3823.2000000000003s)]
*  We'll talk about our Sacramento, but this is eight. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3825.76s)]
*  This is I was trying to figure out why it's even higher than seven [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3828.48s)]
*  and a half, what I guess. But so Tampa was what? [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3832.2400000000002s)]
*  Three. And Detroit's eight and a half. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3835.48s)]
*  I think that's ridiculous. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3839.32s)]
*  I don't understand that at all with Detroit's defense, [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3840.84s)]
*  because they look good on against Minnesota because Darnold sucked [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3844.56s)]
*  and sailed like 10 passes. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3848.2799999999997s)]
*  We now we're now we think Detroit's defense is back. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3850.08s)]
*  They gave up 40 plus points like three weeks before that. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3852.52s)]
*  The overlander is by high, by far the highest so far and [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3857.4s)]
*  at fifty five and a half. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3861.92s)]
*  So I guess they're thinking it could get out of hand with one score, [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3863.2799999999997s)]
*  even if it's close late. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3866.72s)]
*  Well, this lined up really nicely for the Lions. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3870.04s)]
*  Yeah, they get the one seed, they get a week off. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3874.16s)]
*  They get Washington around to that just pulled out yet another crazy win, [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3878.2799999999997s)]
*  but still has a rookie quarterback. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3883.2s)]
*  Like the leap of just thinking mentally of Washington, [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3886.4s)]
*  I know they want 12 games, they're a good team, [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3889.52s)]
*  but just thinking about them in the NFC title game. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3892.2799999999997s)]
*  That seems like a lot. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3897.04s)]
*  Give me if you're if you're Dan Campbell, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3899.24s)]
*  and let's say you get through this game out of the three possible opponents, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3901.68s)]
*  Rams, Vikings, Eagles. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3906.32s)]
*  Who do you want? [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3910.48s)]
*  I think I'd be the most afraid of the Vikings, as crazy as that sounds. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3912.28s)]
*  Really? And they might lose tomorrow. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3915.5200000000004s)]
*  Familiarity. Yeah. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3917.1200000000003s)]
*  Don't you think? [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3918.6800000000003s)]
*  Because I do think there's a world where those were the two best teams, [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3920.6800000000003s)]
*  not just in the NFC, but the whole league, potentially. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3923.76s)]
*  Withstanding the whole chiefs playoff pedigree and all that stuff. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3926.88s)]
*  But what if AJ Brown puts down the book and maybe he'll finish [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3929.6400000000003s)]
*  in her excellence by then? [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3934.04s)]
*  He's got a long time. He's got two weeks. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3935.96s)]
*  I with the way Hertz looks, I wouldn't be as scared of the Eagles [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3939.52s)]
*  as I would have been four weeks ago. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3943.48s)]
*  Right. I think. Yeah. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3946.16s)]
*  I mean, he had 39 yards at halftime. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3948.88s)]
*  I know. I just read you that it says numbers and that he's winning these [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3951.56s)]
*  playoff games. It's ridiculous. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3955.0s)]
*  But it does bug me that third and three, they got you over a barrel [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3956.96s)]
*  every single time. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3960.4s)]
*  All right. So we're we're going to [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3963.36s)]
*  we'll save the rest of it for tomorrow when we react off. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3966.28s)]
*  All right. We'll get that up. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3969.04s)]
*  You're right. I'm up three to one. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3971.2400000000002s)]
*  I won the week. I'm up three to one. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3972.76s)]
*  We'll do it for fun. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3974.44s)]
*  What's what's the. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3975.6400000000003s)]
*  Are we tied for the season? [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3977.08s)]
*  We were tied. We were tied heading into the week. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3978.88s)]
*  Yeah. So I'm up by one. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3981.0s)]
*  This is great. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3983.4s)]
*  Be your first. This could give hope to Buffalo fans, [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3984.36s)]
*  Minnesota fans, Washington commanders fans. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3988.04s)]
*  Hold on. Let me read you my guess. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3991.2799999999997s)]
*  The Lions record in middle school. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3993.3199999999997s)]
*  I went 16 weeks. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3995.56s)]
*  I read. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=3997.16s)]
*  How many great high school to their 30s athletes [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4000.9199999999996s)]
*  can you think of who were great the entire time all the way through? [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4005.56s)]
*  Because I guess I get basketball. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4010.2799999999997s)]
*  Basketball happens more. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4011.68s)]
*  Basketball happens way more easy to figure out. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4012.9199999999996s)]
*  Football happens with the quarterbacks, with the running backs and the receivers. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4015.52s)]
*  I would argue it doesn't really. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4019.96s)]
*  Emmett was like that. Emmett was awesome. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4021.2s)]
*  Emmett was great. Right. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4023.16s)]
*  He was awesome. He was a high school college pro guy. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4024.28s)]
*  Yeah. But other than that, I don't know. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4027.32s)]
*  So Rudy, are there other guys that I'm not thinking of? [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4029.4s)]
*  How many guys were awesome high school college pros? [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4032.4s)]
*  I mean, yeah, Peyton. Yeah. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4035.72s)]
*  Oh, Peyton is a good one. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4037.52s)]
*  Was Peyton awesome? Like ninth grade on. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4038.68s)]
*  He couldn't get over the the hump though in college, right? [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4041.92s)]
*  Wasn't that kind of the knock on him? [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4044.76s)]
*  You still put up stats. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4046.16s)]
*  Yeah, no, he's great. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4048.0s)]
*  He just couldn't be Florida. Yeah. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4049.12s)]
*  I guess Randy Moss, but then Randy Moss had to transfer when he was in college [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4051.96s)]
*  and the college went a little sideways for a second. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4056.2000000000003s)]
*  Mm hmm. Oh, Adrian Peterson, right? [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4059.32s)]
*  But that's a good one. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4062.64s)]
*  Obviously, you slow down in the last couple of years, but. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4063.92s)]
*  Yeah, a ridiculous recruiting class. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4067.4s)]
*  Rudy, when when Henry got. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4069.96s)]
*  When he went, fell to the second round after the Alabama season, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4072.6800000000003s)]
*  did that seem like the right range for you? [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4075.7200000000003s)]
*  Or did you think everybody was a big mistake? [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4077.24s)]
*  No, you remember people called that like a terrible pick because, you know, [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4079.56s)]
*  he's like big. Was he fast enough? [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4082.56s)]
*  There are people that really did. I was too slow. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4084.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't know. Yeah. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4086.64s)]
*  Which is weird, because I think he did. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4087.8799999999997s)]
*  I don't think his 40 time was terrible. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4089.3199999999997s)]
*  But yeah, like there were people that crushed that pick as a second round pick. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4090.8399999999997s)]
*  And I don't know. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4094.04s)]
*  It's always weird, though, with the Alabama running bass, because sometimes, [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4096.12s)]
*  you know, like they're just they play with the best offensive line [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4098.639999999999s)]
*  and yada yada yada. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4102.599999999999s)]
*  That was a knock. Yeah, right. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4104.36s)]
*  Yeah, the whole thing. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4106.12s)]
*  I'm sure the listeners will come up with a couple of. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4107.48s)]
*  Yeah, I know they're going to kill us for missing an obvious one. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4109.2s)]
*  Well, you know, I was looking at one of those lists where they had the 50 best. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4112.76s)]
*  Tony Dorsett was apparently one of the great high school running backs of all time. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4115.84s)]
*  And then he was really good at Pittsburgh, too. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4119.4s)]
*  Pennsylvania. So he might be another one. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4120.96s)]
*  How long was his his Cowboys run was probably eight or nine years. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4122.4s)]
*  So it's great. Yeah. Yeah, right in there. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4125.4s)]
*  All right. Thanks. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4128.08s)]
*  Suri, who do you like in the title game while you're here? [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4129.28s)]
*  Ohio State. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4131.76s)]
*  Oh, wow. Right. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4133.4800000000005s)]
*  The line in the Ohio State. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4134.96s)]
*  It's like, is it a six now? [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4137.4400000000005s)]
*  What is it? Oh, sorry. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4139.56s)]
*  Eight and a half. No, it's eight and a half. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4141.68s)]
*  So tease them with the chiefs. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4143.28s)]
*  You could tease it. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4145.2s)]
*  Like I said, we're going to sit down with your financial planner. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4146.6s)]
*  OK. All right. Can't be. Thanks, Rudy. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4148.76s)]
*  All right. Want to. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4151.08s)]
*  Should we skip parent corner this week and talk California? [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4152.28s)]
*  We could. Yes. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4155.84s)]
*  We should mention that as as we're we're recording this on a Sunday night [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4157.8s)]
*  and. We got notice a couple of hours ago [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4162.04s)]
*  that there's like a severe wind thing coming on Tuesday. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4165.76s)]
*  So. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4169.56s)]
*  It's hard to say where we're going next, [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4174.240000000001s)]
*  but this was already the worst week since I've been in L.A. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4176.64s)]
*  by far, not even close. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4180.360000000001s)]
*  One of the biggest natural disasters in American history. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4182.4400000000005s)]
*  And I can't wrap my head around it all these days later. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4186.92s)]
*  And you're over and you're over in the Manhattan Beach area. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4189.96s)]
*  I don't know how much you've dealt with some of the areas that were affected [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4193.76s)]
*  when we're talking palisades in Malibu and Eaton, Altadena were the big four. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4196.44s)]
*  We knew we knew a lot of people from friends of friends, [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4203.08s)]
*  people my kids went to school with who lived in different parts. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4206.28s)]
*  And and it's I don't even know how to describe this to people [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4209.92s)]
*  who don't live in California, like the wide swath of devastation. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4214.76s)]
*  The palisades just basically being gone, [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4220.4s)]
*  whole parts of Malibu just being gone, Eaton, Altadena. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4222.96s)]
*  Like I it's one of those things when you see it, when you watch it on TV [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4226.08s)]
*  and it's happening in other areas and it's like, man, that seems awful. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4231.08s)]
*  But you don't really fully understand it until you live there. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4234.4s)]
*  And I don't I know I'll come back. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4237.36s)]
*  I know everybody bounces back. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4239.8s)]
*  Eventually, but man, it's it's really hard to even understand [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4242.44s)]
*  how the rebuilding is going to happen and how long it's going to take. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4247.44s)]
*  And you just see those wide overhead shots of these different areas. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4251.0s)]
*  And it's just like it's it's just so awful. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4254.08s)]
*  And it's just been an awful week. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4257.44s)]
*  And it just feels like it's not going to get better. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4258.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And that's also part of it. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4261.5599999999995s)]
*  And I'm sorry. I know this goes on in like Maui and other places. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4263.44s)]
*  And we should be thinking about that. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4266.639999999999s)]
*  But yeah, when it's in your backyard and like people are checking in with me, [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4267.759999999999s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know. I'm good for now. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4270.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm all right for now. I have no idea. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4272.5599999999995s)]
*  And it depends on the wind. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4274.44s)]
*  And somehow, did you know they could predict wind for three days? [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4276.28s)]
*  I didn't even know they could do that. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4279.679999999999s)]
*  But so we know like there's bad shit ahead. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4281.32s)]
*  And we know a lot of people who got devastated. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4285.16s)]
*  And it's really rough. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4287.639999999999s)]
*  It really I don't want to bum everyone out, but it really is like, oh, my God. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4288.879999999999s)]
*  You feel like you have so much control over your life. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4292.599999999999s)]
*  And then and then you don't. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4294.48s)]
*  You really don't. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4295.719999999999s)]
*  With like something stupid like this, and we don't know how it started [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4296.4s)]
*  and we don't know how it's going to end. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4298.799999999999s)]
*  And and that's and we need football as a distraction. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4300.72s)]
*  And it's hardly ranks as important. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4304.6s)]
*  But I mean, for God sakes, I wish we could like talk about this [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4308.52s)]
*  as if it's going on in the past, but it's not. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4313.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't seem like it's over yet. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4316.200000000001s)]
*  We'll see. I mean, we've been here. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4319.4400000000005s)]
*  I've been here since 02 and you've been here a few years before that. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4321.52s)]
*  And there's been wind events and it's been windy. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4324.68s)]
*  And I remember [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4327.24s)]
*  over and over again, especially like even taking my daughter to soccer tournaments. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4329.719999999999s)]
*  And it would be like 35 degree, 35 mile an hour winds in Lancaster and stuff like that. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4333.679999999999s)]
*  For some reason, these winds seemed a little they were they're pointing them out [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4338.48s)]
*  a couple of days before, like, hey, this is pretty scary this time around. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4342.36s)]
*  And then everything that happened was so much worse than you ever, ever could imagine. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4345.639999999999s)]
*  Even heading through Tuesday, like it was [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4350.48s)]
*  starting the palisades and then all of a sudden by mid [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4353.92s)]
*  early Tuesday night here, you really felt like this could go [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4357.72s)]
*  in a in a direction you just never could have been in your worst nightmare. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4361.48s)]
*  Imagine, but first responders, fire department, police department, [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4365.4s)]
*  the helicopter pilots drop in the water, all the TV people who were out there [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4372.2s)]
*  braving the elements. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4377.36s)]
*  I mean, one of the things that was [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4378.32s)]
*  really inspiring was how many people were trying to get out there, [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4380.84s)]
*  trying to tell us what was going on. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4384.599999999999s)]
*  And for a lot of people watching TV, not knowing if it was their neighborhood, their house. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4386.28s)]
*  And it was you're just relying on all these people, these Twitter accounts [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4391.599999999999s)]
*  like that L.A. scanner account. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4395.599999999999s)]
*  But and it turned out to be just a 10 out of 10, the worst case scenario that we could have. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4398.76s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Like you said, even the reporters and these firestorms [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4404.28s)]
*  like that are going on like, you know, 100 feet behind them. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4407.96s)]
*  It's like, what what is going on? [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4410.84s)]
*  And like I said, I wish that the worst is behind us. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4412.36s)]
*  But then, you know, we have a mutual friend that's a doctor at UCLA. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4415.88s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, man, they have to evacuate this hospital. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4419.44s)]
*  If the if the storm if the fires come within two and a half miles of this place. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4423.4800000000005s)]
*  And it's right now it's four. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4428.12s)]
*  I was like, are you kidding me? What the hell? [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4429.44s)]
*  What does that look like? Evacuating a whole giant hospital like that? [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4431.04s)]
*  That's my God. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4435.0s)]
*  That's going to be something that's just even more outrageous [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4436.52s)]
*  and right up there with anything else. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4439.4400000000005s)]
*  So, yeah, just, you know, plenty of go fund me is out there. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4441.8s)]
*  Plenty of places to look to help plenty of scammers, too, [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4445.88s)]
*  that are assholes trying to take advantage of this. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4449.080000000001s)]
*  But just be careful and be diligent. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4451.200000000001s)]
*  And, you know, yeah, I'm going to I wanted to really kind of dive into it [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4453.200000000001s)]
*  and see which ones I trusted and maybe on the next podcast could talk about some of the [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4457.68s)]
*  some of the possibilities. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4462.8s)]
*  You know, some of the stuff's going to get rebuilt. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4464.28s)]
*  And I'm sure it's going to take a while. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4466.88s)]
*  There's some other stuff that I don't know how they how stuff comes back. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4470.04s)]
*  Houses that were, you know, from 1940, 1950 that you would never build the same way. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4474.16s)]
*  And some some pieces of California that just had real special characters. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4478.84s)]
*  Certainly one of the reasons I wanted to live here, being near the ocean [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4484.32s)]
*  and just some of the coolest parts of the country I'd ever seen. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4487.96s)]
*  And and then on top of it, just, I think, losing your house and having no power over that [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4490.96s)]
*  and just knowing all the stuff that you kept and everything's gone. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4497.4800000000005s)]
*  Like, I don't there's very few worse feelings than that. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4500.4800000000005s)]
*  So it's just so much pain and so much heartbreak out here. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4503.76s)]
*  We tried to do podcasts, tried to talk football and tried to keep people's minds off it for an hour. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4507.72s)]
*  But it's really, really horrible. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4512.4800000000005s)]
*  And I really hope we've hit the end of it and that it's not going to get worse. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4514.96s)]
*  That'd be nice, right? [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4518.48s)]
*  That'd be nice. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4519.48s)]
*  Not too much to ask. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4520.48s)]
*  Paul A&T is our talk. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4521.48s)]
*  Let's just get out. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4522.799999999999s)]
*  Let's get everyone safe. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4523.799999999999s)]
*  Well, that's it. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4527.08s)]
*  Best of luck to everybody out there. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4528.08s)]
*  We're really sorry about everything that happened on one of the later podcasts that we do. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4529.48s)]
*  Hopefully this week, we'll try to have some maybe even tomorrow when we come back tomorrow [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4533.96s)]
*  for that last game, maybe we could try to figure out a couple of good things that we actually trust [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4539.12s)]
*  and a couple ways to get the word out to try to help people. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4545.16s)]
*  I like that. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4549.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, it's crazy. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4550.5599999999995s)]
*  Your week started with one of the Bella twins twerking four feet from you. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4552.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, I think- [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4556.2s)]
*  I know, that was Monday night. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4557.2s)]
*  It feels like it was 100 days ago. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4558.2s)]
*  That was minus 65,000 to make parent corner. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4560.2s)]
*  And too many terrible things happened since. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4563.2s)]
*  So anyway. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4566.2s)]
*  Well, we're really feeling for everybody out there. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4567.2s)]
*  And it's just really heartbreaking. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4569.2s)]
*  I really come to love LA too. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4571.5599999999995s)]
*  And it's just hard to wrap your head around, especially places that you've been to a million times. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4574.4400000000005s)]
*  And now you think, well, wait a second. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4582.4400000000005s)]
*  What's that going to look like now? [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4584.4400000000005s)]
*  But hopefully we can all get through this and figure it out. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2xWKbvEqU&t=4586.4400000000005s)]
