# Why Are There So Many Struggling Quarterbacks? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [October 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_mmWzv0LLo)
*  The quarterback play has been abysmal. They asked Brady today on the podium, like,
*  what do you see when you're watching the football? And he's like, I just see a lot of bad football.
*  He's right. And the football has been really erratic, skittish. We've seen leads blown,
*  but most importantly, just a ton of bad quarterback play. What happened? I thought this was going to
*  be like the decade of the quarterbacks. Why did it go the other way? No, dude. And I think you're
*  spot on. And I start going through my reasoning. Okay. Is it because the preseason is shorter?
*  Is it because guys aren't playing as much? Is it because there's not a lot of contact in August in
*  these training camps? And it's not what it used to be. But a lot of this football, as good as the
*  parity has been, and there's only one undefeated team remaining, every team has at least had a
*  tie or a win. The football has been kind of shitty. And I say that as an employee of the NFL, it's
*  not as crisp as we're used to seeing. And from our stars, you're talking about Brady struggling,
*  you're talking about Rogers struggling, you're talking about Stafford. You go right down the
*  list. I mean, we did this exercise off camera, I think, on Good Morning Football, and I'll do
*  it with you. If you go through the NFC, Jalen Hurts has been the best quarterback in the NFC.
*  Who is number two as far as NFC quarterbacks this year, objectively? Who do you think it is?
*  Just somebody playing well? Yeah. Who's playing the best football? Not who's got the best career.
*  If you're saying who's had the best first four weeks of the season, who would you say it is?
*  I would probably say Rogers just because I think they've dropped a couple touchdowns from him.
*  If he gets that 75 yard Watson one, if he gets the Dobbs one last week,
*  that's an extra 120 yards and two touchdowns for him, basically. I don't think he's been that bad,
*  but yeah, after that, I mean, golf has been, it's hard to say about that they've been playing kind
*  of crap teams, but now he's got a bunch of injuries. But yeah, you're right. He's putting
*  up stats. How about Gino Smith? If you were to say, how about Cooper Rush? If you were to say
*  in August, here are the four best quarterbacks in the NFC a month through the season, which was
*  supposed to be Dak and Stafford and Brady and all these guys. If you were to say it's Cooper Rush
*  and it's Gino Smith, that's why the NFL is amazing. You could laugh at it all you want, but those guys
*  are playing the best at the position. I don't know if Rogers has played well. I would push back on
*  you and say, I don't think he's played well. I think there's these first half of these games,
*  they are so out of sync. And with the exception of that Bears game, I think they got really lucky.
*  And you saw the image and I think Bakhtiari tweeted out of the floor with that huge gasp of relief
*  at that final field goal to escape that game against Bailey Zappi. I think that's how I feel
*  every Packers game so far that they've won. It's like, gosh, that was a struggle. That was tough.
*  Aside from the Bears game, it just feels like they're getting by, but I don't think Rogers
*  has been lights out. I don't think so either, which is why it's funny that he's probably been
*  the second best NFC cupid. It's almost by default because you wouldn't say Kyle LaMurray. He's been
*  bad. Bad. You wouldn't say Brady. No. You wouldn't say Stafford or Cousins. Then you get into the
*  golf territory. I think going backwards though, I just wrote down all the quarterbacks that I think
*  are either bad, pretty bad, or a notch below mediocre. I wanted to see if there were more in
*  the NFC or the AFC. In the NFC, we have Fields, we have Mayfield, we have Danny Times.
*  Can I interrupt on Baker? Baker has objectively been maybe the worst quarterback in football this
*  year. When I came out before the season, I was like, I think Darnold could still be the starter.
*  I was laughed out of the room. I don't know what people thought they were getting from Baker because
*  last year, as banged up as he was objectively, he was not great. He's had some good moments,
*  but yeah, okay. Sorry. Baker, I think- Well, that was- Baker was a misfire by me because
*  I was thinking, well, two years ago- Sure.
*  He made round two. It's not like he's never done anything in the league, but
*  I thought that last week performance, whatever week that was, yeah, it was week four.
*  Against the Cardinals. Awful. Sorry. Brunkitis Bill is here.
*  Not remembering what week it is. He was so bad in that game that I'm actually surprised he started
*  this week because if I'm Matt Rule, I am now in job protection mode. Even if I'm throwing PJ Walker
*  out there, at least that's not another Baker Mayfield week. Anyway, Fields, Mayfield, Danny
*  Dimes, Wentz, who if he doesn't have blocking, is just a complete train wreck. Then you move into that
*  Cooper Rush, Mariota, Andy Dalton group where it's like- Don't hurt me.
*  Who can keep you in games. Yeah. You can't get totally hurt. Yeah. To keep you around.
*  Mariota's been fumbling a lot, which is so frustrating if you're a Falcons fan because
*  it's like, just don't hurt us. That's all we're asking. Dalton last week was more than serviceable
*  and I think that level of quarterback play, as sad as this is, don't hurt us might be
*  superb in the NFC this year. Then you have Goff and Gino who, same thing, don't hurt us,
*  but also you can have a moment for a quarter. Shit's happening. Whoa, wait a second. Did I
*  evaluate you wrong? And then they'll do something dumb. And then I think finally Jimmy G.
*  Where- Jimmy G good? No, I think Jimmy G mediocre. Yeah. I think that's the- Jimmy G's the line.
*  And then after that you have Cousins and Stafford and Murray, none of whom are playing well,
*  but I think the pedigree, you have to put them over all those guys. And then you have
*  Brady and Rogers and then Hertz who's playing the best right now. But I listed one, two, three, five,
*  10 of the 16 QBs in the NFL in the NFC, mediocre or worse. So you're like, well,
*  the AFC has got to be better. Pickett, Zach Wilson, Davis Mills, the seven inning starter of the NFL.
*  Oh my God. He threw a seven, but then the bullpen's gone. They're always winning. Yeah.
*  Brissette, who's been, I think, better than people expected, but he really hurt them last week.
*  He did. Bridgewater, who's good at covering games. I'm not sure you want him taking into the playoffs.
*  Mack Jones hurt right now. Matt Ryan, who I think time has passed him by. And Tannahill.
*  So that's eight. So we have 18 quarterbacks, I would say are mediocre or worse. That is more
*  than half the league. Now I looked at the QBR from the last few years, right? And QBR, it's a little
*  bit of a flawed stat, but I think it's better than QB rating. So you go like 2021 and 2020,
*  we only had four QBs below 40 QBR. Below 40 is like, I'm bad. Okay. 50 plus QBR, we had 21 in 2021
*  and 23 in 2020. Even going backwards, 2019, 23, 2018, 23, 2017, 21. So it's always at least
*  two thirds of the league. 60 plus QBR, 12 and 21, and then going backwards, 15, 13, 13, 11.
*  Okay. So like the 12 is like the Mendoza line on that one. Like you're going to get 12. Yeah.
*  What do we have this year? 70 plus, three in 21, five in 20, seven in 19,
*  three in 18, 17 and four. Okay. This year. Yeah. We have nine below 40. Wow. The record before that
*  for the last five years was four. So we have doubled the number of bad QBs. Now smaller sample size.
*  For the 50 plus QBR, again, 21, 23, 23, 23, 21, the last five years. This year, 13.
*  Gosh. Less than half aren't even at 50. Then the 60 plus we're at 10. Last year was 12. The year
*  before was 15. And then we have seven in the 70 plus, which is high. So basically we're top heavy
*  and bottom heavy. And then the middle is lower than expected. Now again, small sample size.
*  And I think you make a good point about the pre-season. And, uh, you know, we've had some
*  wide receiver injuries. I'm sure that's not helping. Like I, you know, Brady, I think would be higher
*  if he had a healthy crew and we've had some offensive line injuries. But I also, I also look
*  at like the way, all right. So like the giants are three and one, the Falcons are two and two,
*  you know, Mary Oda is throwing 70 yards a game. Daniel Jones is attempting like to attend both
*  those teams are running the shit out of the ball. I think the giants go with these three tight ends.
*  And it's like, I say this almost in a lovingly way. It looks like I'm watching JV football,
*  watching the giants with three tight ends running, run left, run, right bootleg play action,
*  go Daniel Jones. And that's what it takes to win because I, you know, giants have no receivers
*  right now. Giants offensive line is playing well. Like let's use that as our strength. I,
*  I think these offensive coordinators are kind of throwing out the, the aesthetics. And in
*  Arthur Smith's case, I mean, they ran the ball 14 straight plays in the second half for 172 yards
*  in the second half against the Browns. And it wasn't Cordero Patterson. It was Caleb Huntley
*  and it was Avery Williams. And it was this guy, Tyler Algier, who's a fifth round pick out of BYU,
*  who played linebacker in college also like these offensive coaches, Dable and Smith, of course,
*  they want to put on, uh, you know, the tape of like, look how pretty I can do this and design it.
*  But I also think it's like, we've got a scratch to get by with what we've got. And in these
*  quarterbacks with Daniel Jones and Marcus Mariota, this might be the best way to win games.
