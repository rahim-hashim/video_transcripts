# Five Favorite NFL Defenses with Sheil Kapadia  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [August 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btGCd-ey_dE)
*  So you're going to do your five favorites, counting down from five to one, five favorite,
*  I'm sorry, five most fascinating defenses.
*  What's the find the word fascinating?
*  Fascinating, it's not the best.
*  It's the ones that could kind of go one way or the other that I'm most curious about going
*  interesting, you know, going into the season.
*  So that's how I kind of defined it.
*  So would you say low basement, high ceiling or just murky, amorphous, confusing, just
*  all of that stuff?
*  Yeah, it mixes it all up.
*  One is better than I think I have them higher than I think anyone else would have them.
*  Another is if it goes one way, this team can win the Super Bowl.
*  If it doesn't, it's going to look really bad.
*  So I tried to mix it up, mix it all together.
*  You know, you're vague enough with the description and then you can go in any direction you want.
*  That's my content style.
*  Number five is what?
*  I got the San Francisco 49ers.
*  And here's why I put them there, because I think there's this revisionist history of
*  what happened in the Super Bowl last year.
*  You know, now we think about it.
*  Oh, Patrick Mahomes was inevitable and the Niners couldn't stop them.
*  Bill, if you look at that game, the first nine drives the Chiefs had in that game, they
*  had six points.
*  They didn't have a touchdown.
*  They had two field goals.
*  Average NFL game, you only get 11 possessions.
*  So like for a big chunk of that game, the 49ers did their job.
*  Now, ultimately, obviously, you gave Mahomes more chances, but a lot of that was on the
*  49ers offense for going three and out three straight times.
*  And you give Mahomes the ball back.
*  So I look at that 49ers defense from last year and then I look at their actions were
*  right after the Super Bowl.
*  Shanae Ann's like, I'm firing this defensive coordinator.
*  It's his fault.
*  Steve Wilkes, he's out of there.
*  And now he brings in Nick Sorensen, one of the new characters in our NFL lies for the
*  season.
*  Never before been a defensive coordinator coming in.
*  And you just kind of get the feeling like if Kyle Shanahan could call both the offense
*  and the defense, he'd be like, almost like a player coach.
*  You'd be like, I want to do that.
*  And you get the sense Sorensen.
*  He's probably like, I got to just do whatever this guy says because he didn't like what
*  the last guy was doing.
*  And he's out of there.
*  So I'm looking at the 49ers.
*  Can they get back to the Super Bowl?
*  I think the last team to do it was your Patriots, right?
*  After they lose to the Eagles, they come back.
*  Otherwise, every Super Bowl loser has not made it back this century.
*  It's only been one.
*  And so I'm looking at this defense.
*  They've still got good players, but I'm looking at that coaching situation and everyone being
*  a little more tense in the Super Bowl hangover stuff.
*  And which way is that defense going to go?
*  So that's why I've got them number five.
*  They had a bad injury during that Super Bowl game.
*  Yeah, Greenlaw, not Greenlaw Hargrave.
*  We expect him to be bigger this year, right?
*  They were slightly disappointed by him last year.
*  It feels like a little bit of a comeback.
*  Then Hufanka is coming back.
*  Yeah.
*  And anytime you have a guy coming off an injury, like when I'm looking at all these teams going
*  into the season, I'm like, shield, don't just pencil them in to what they were previously,
*  because sometimes it takes time.
*  So yeah, they still have a good pass rush.
*  They still have a lockdown corner in Travarious Ward.
*  They've still got the best linebacker in football in Fred Warner.
*  So I still think they're going to be pretty good, but it's like, you know, last year,
*  the numbers didn't match the eye test with them.
*  They got, you know, their defense in the first couple of rounds of the playoffs was bad.
*  So that's one of the things I'm looking at with the Niners.
*  I did, you know, I did my dumb player rankings every year because it gives me a sense.
*  I had them with five, you know, pink chippers, red chippers, or blue chippers on defense,
*  both Hargrave, Armstead, Warner and Ward.
*  And that's not even known about Hufanka, whether he can get back to where he was.
*  I mean, potentially that's over 50% of their defense.
*  Plus, you know, I know their schedule is not awesome this year would be the one reason
*  to be a little worried about it.
*  But I mean, from a talent standpoint, they still have the most talent in the league.
*  The Super Bowl hangover is terrifying.
*  You just look at the evidence and it's the same evidence against the Chiefs three-peat, right?
*  It's like, hey, you know, who's three-peated with the Super Bowl?
*  Literally nobody. It's never happened.
*  That has to mean something.
*  We've had almost 60 Super Bowls at this point.
*  So I think the same thing with the Super Bowl hangover, the only team that was able to
*  shake it off had the best quarterback of all time.
*  And by the way, scored 13 points in the Super Bowl game and somehow won anyway, because
*  Jerrigoff just fell apart.
*  So, all right, San Francisco five.
*  What do you have it for?
*  The Chicago Bears.
*  I don't know where you are with the Chicago Bears team, but all the hype right now is
*  about Caleb Williams and the supporting cast.
*  And I get it, too.
*  I'm watching the highlights and getting excited.
*  I actually think their defense is going to be better than their offense.
*  And I think they're going to make the playoffs because they have different ways to win
*  games. This defense last year, they trade for Montez Swett in the middle of the season.
*  If you look at their numbers, weird trade, but they still have worked out.
*  Yeah, weird trade, but it worked out.
*  They signed him since they traded for him.
*  They were a top 10 defense the rest of the season.
*  Now, there's always going to be some noise there.
*  It's a small sample, all that.
*  But you look at it, they needed some pass rush.
*  I think their corner spill might be the best.
*  It might be one of the stories of the season.
*  They have this trio of young cornerbacks, Jalen Johnson.
*  They signed in the offseason.
*  I think he's like one of the most underrated players in the NFL.
*  He's like a top five corner, got paid this last offseason.
*  He was awesome last year.
*  And then they've got two young corners right next to him.
*  They've got two good linebackers.
*  And so I wish they had a little more pass rush.
*  But I was debating between the Bears and some other teams when I'm looking at who's
*  who am I having in the wild card spot?
*  And I kept looking at that defense going, this could really be a surprise unit.
*  This season, I've got them as a top 10 group.
*  And I think we're going to be talking a lot about Caleb Williams and those receivers.
*  But we're also going to be talking a lot about this Bears defense.
*  So give me the Eberfluss piece of this.
*  Yeah, he doesn't run like a he's not someone who all the film nerds
*  are going to be tweeting out, oh, my gosh, look at this wrinkle by Matt Eberfluss.
*  He looks good. We all know he looks good this summer.
*  He's more of an old school line up, play, play fast.
*  We don't need to trick them.
*  Just, you know, hit the quarterback, create turnovers, be sound in your fundamentals.
*  So that's not always my favorite type of defensive coordinator,
*  because offenses are so good in 2024.
*  But I feel like a lot of weeks, especially in their back seven,
*  they're going to have a talent advantage over the opponents they're playing.
*  And they're another team, pretty soft schedule.
*  I think it's a bottom seven or eight schedule this season.
*  So I think they're going to be able to beat up on a lot of bad teams.
*  Their over under has not shifted on Fandel this entire offseason.
*  I was taken aback when I saw it in the spring.
*  It was eight and a half. It's like, wow, that's aggressive.
*  And then there was juice on it.
*  The juice is now minus 160, which is almost about as high as you can go
*  before they're like, fuck it, we'll make it nine and a half.
*  But it seems like a lot of people are on them.
*  And that's as grizzled old football fans slash gambler.
*  They just have a lot of buzz and a lot of smoke right now.
*  And that always makes me nervous, because, you know, it's a rookie quarterback.
*  Bunch they loaded up on this receiver system that once we get in a cold weather,
*  I'm not sure how that's going to work out.
*  I'm not sure about Iber Fluss at all, like at all.
*  And I think I think the conference is a little better than maybe people
*  are given a credit for it.
*  It seems to be this feeling that how are we going to get to seven NFC playoff teams?
*  I'm a little more bullish on the NFC.
*  What where do you stand? Are you bullish, less bullish or no?
*  Or dead even on NFC?
*  No, I'm the same way.
*  I had like three for that last wild card spot.
*  I had like three teams I was debating between.
*  And I ended up going with the Bears because you and I have talked before.
*  You got to get six new teams or around six new teams in the playoffs.
*  You can't just go chalk.
*  So I was debating between them and a couple other teams, the Cowboys, the Rams.
*  And I'm like, I don't know.
*  I think the Cardinals are even in consideration for me.
*  I feel like there's a bunch of teams in the NFC.
*  I wouldn't be shocked if they went nine and eight and got the seven seed.
*  You only need to go nine and eight to get the seven seed.
*  Washington.
*  It's not insane.
*  I mean, it's crazy, but it's not insane.
*  If Jaden Day knows it's just really good right away, they might be pretty good.
*  Well, that's the other thing. Rookie quarterbacks.
*  Like, I feel like this time of year, we're like, oh, my gosh, they got this guy.
*  He's awesome. I looked at the last 10 years.
*  And if you look at every rookie quarterback who started like at least 10 games,
*  on average, they perform like the 26th best starter in the NFL.
*  That rookie season.
*  So we all look at CJ Stroud and we're like, oh, my gosh, who's it going to be?
*  Every CJ Stroud, there's a Bryce Young.
*  And most of the time, it's going to be a tough rookie season for these quarterbacks.
*  So that was my other hesitation with the Bears.
*  As much as I like Caleb Williams and the supporting cast, it's like,
*  you should start with the baseline that on average, this guy is going to be the
*  26th best starter. All right.
*  How much better than that do I think he can be?
*  How much worse than that do I think he can be?
*  And predicting these rookie quarterbacks, I mean, it's going to swing the season.
*  And it's so hard to say because I'm with you.
*  If Jaden Daniels just puts the offense on his back and it's like a dual threat guy,
*  they're going to be interesting.
*  Caleb Williams might not, you know, maybe he takes a lot of sacks and turns the ball over.
*  And it's not quite as good as the picture I'm painting here.
*  So, yeah, that's the hardest thing to predict, I think, in the entire NFL every season.
*  Yeah, I have Washington, Arizona and Chicago.
*  I'm still trying to figure out who I want as the playoff teams, but I have those three
*  near each other.
*  And I think the difference is Chicago is the best defense.
*  But, you know, Arizona might have a top five offense.
*  You covered it in your piece.
*  They might they might just be really good offensively all season.
*  And then Washington, the Daniels piece, the fact that he's older,
*  the fact that he was so good last year, he checked some boxes for
*  I wouldn't be shocked if he came in right away.
*  All right. Let's get to number three.
*  The Dallas Cowboys are number three, you know, and the Dallas Cowboys are always
*  good for. Here's the reason why, because I think it's rare
*  that your defensive coordinator leaves for a head coaching job
*  and you end up upgrading at the spot.
*  And I think that's what they've done.
*  I think Mike Zimmer, we all made a lot of jokes about Mike Zimmer as a head coach.
*  The overall tenure was OK for the Vikings, but, you know,
*  he was kind of a funny character to have as a defensive coach.
*  I think he's like one of the best defensive minds of the last 20, 25 years in the NFL.
*  If you look at those Vikings defenses, eight seasons,
*  he produced the top 10 defense five different times.
*  And so I think he comes in with Micah Parsons,
*  with the talent they have at cornerback.
*  They've signed some veterans at defensive tackle.
*  I actually think this Cowboys defense is going to be awesome.
*  I think they're going to be a top five defense.
*  I think they're going to take a step back on offense,
*  but they're kind of going to be able to make up for a lot of that with Mike Zimmer.
*  So that's one part of it. Why I find them interesting.
*  Now, the other part of it is, you know, buddy Ryan and Kevin Gilbride.
*  Remember that clip when Buddy Ryan went to punch like couldn't you just see Mike Zimmer
*  being like, how is Mike, Mike McCarthy, what are you doing this guy?
*  And so he has to be held back on the sentient angle.
*  I like this. Yeah. His face is all red.
*  Or, you know, one of your favorite topics, Mike Zimmer, interim head coach, week 12.
*  Who knows? It's all looming.
*  It's all sort of been like, why did you?
*  Why were you talking with Jared Jones in the parking lot? I saw you.
*  Does Dallas have any linebackers?
*  You know what? No.
*  But if you look, if you look around the NFL, they have none on the roster.
*  Honestly, you could say that about probably like 27 teams. It's crazy.
*  When I was doing those rankings, there were like five teams where I'm like,
*  oh, I like their linebackers and every other team.
*  I'm like, oh, my gosh, these guys are going to get picked on every week.
*  So, yes, I did kind of surf past that.
*  And you are it is a fair point to make.
*  I so badly wanted to zag with Dallas because everybody's out on them.
*  I mean, it's just it's just been the whole summer and they are not.
*  They're the opposite of a sexy pick.
*  And you look at their even from a fantasy standpoint,
*  where it's basically like Dak and C.V.
*  Lam. And no other person you'd probably want to start in any week.
*  Like they're running backs for for to come in as Zeke Elliott and Rico Doudo
*  is like, that's who you're going to start the season with.
*  It's like it's amazing.
*  Like they're just throwing away positions.
*  They're throwing away running back the throwing linebacker.
*  And I don't really know what the objective is.
*  I know everybody's talked about Dallas for, you know, for six months.
*  I don't understand what they're doing.
*  I don't understand the point of not extending deck.
*  I don't understand why the city lamp thing took the whole year to figure out.
*  Like, I just don't get it.
*  And it almost seems like Jerry Jones is mad at the team.
*  And he's like, fuck this, I've been so disappointed over and over again.
*  I just let's just start the season.
*  I'll decide what to do then. It's bizarre.
*  Yeah, it's I've been hammering it all off season that I know
*  they have mismanaged that roster.
*  They're 30 second in cash spending in the NFL.
*  So all the things we talk about with the cap, if you extend guys early,
*  if you give them big signing bonuses, you get flexibility
*  and you can improve your roster.
*  They haven't done that.
*  And then they look around and they cry.
*  Well, my God, no, it's not the salary cap is an issue because you made it an issue.
*  Other teams wouldn't have done that.
*  They would assign these guys early.
*  So I think they deserve to get crushed for all their roster mismanagement
*  at the same time. I'm kind of with you.
*  They've won 36 games the last three seasons.
*  That's second in the NFL to the Chiefs.
*  I'm talking about just the regular season.
*  So I'm like, am I overthinking this?
*  Because I don't have them in the playoffs.
*  I have them nine and eight just out of the playoffs.
*  But that's one where I know I could be looking stupid once we get to December.
*  Or it's the end of September and their own four, one and three.
*  And people are like McCarthy on the hot seat.
*  You're like, oh, I should have guessed this.
*  Of course, this is going to happen.
*  Lane, yeah, that I'm.
*  Dallas is one of my.
*  Watch out teams, I just I don't like it.
*  I don't like zagging where everybody else is zagging with the same opinion.
*  I also don't really like that division that much, and it's like somebody's got to win
*  that division if your stupid Eagles team gets gets goofy the first couple of weeks.
*  Who knows? All right. Number two.
*  Number two is the Green Bay Packers.
*  Well, we have a new character in our lives who could determine
*  what team gets to the NFC championship or to the Super Bowl.
*  His name is Jeff Halfley.
*  He is the Packers new defensive coordinator.
*  He was the head coach at Boston College last season.
*  Bill, his defense last year allowed 28 points per game,
*  tied for 86th in college football the year before.
*  They allowed 30 points per game, 100th in all of college football.
*  Not a great track record at Boston College.
*  Now we watch college football a little bit.
*  You know, we know that the players matter and maybe it's not.
*  On him. But can he definitely can he give them an upgrade or not?
*  Because this defense dunk last year, I mean, I don't do you remember that Panthers game
*  in like the last month of the season?
*  Bryce Young? Yeah, he looked like a lot of money on it.
*  Of course, I remember it.
*  Yeah. I mean, Bryce Young carved him up.
*  That's the you know, that was the only game all season.
*  And that was against a Packers.
*  They didn't do anything. Well, you look at the numbers.
*  Couldn't defend deep passes, couldn't defend the middle of the field,
*  couldn't defend screens.
*  They suck. At the same time, if I just pull up their depth chart,
*  I can show you seven former first round picks on their roster.
*  I can show you a safety and Xavier McKinney, who they signed in the off season,
*  who I think is a great player, who's really going to help them.
*  And so I look at the talent.
*  I always talk about coaches. Can you do more with less?
*  Joe Berry, their defensive coordinator, did less with more last season.
*  And so if they can just be competent, if they can be like the 15th,
*  20th best defense in the NFL, I think this team can get to the Super Bowl
*  out of the NFC. At the same time,
*  I have no idea if Hapley is good.
*  We could be having the same conversation next year where we're like, well,
*  they fired Hapley and they brought in this new guy. Maybe he'll be good.
*  So he's like this very interesting, under the radar character in our lives
*  that we're going to be talking about one way or another this season.
*  Well, my dad, who has followed BC football for a long time,
*  not a fan of Jeff, just FYI.
*  Yeah, he's not a fan. It's like, wow, BC, what's going on?
*  Not great. Green Bay is I have them in the playoffs.
*  And I'll go this far because I bet both when I was in Massachusetts
*  and I got to use Fandel and I was just driving that thing like a Ferrari.
*  I bet on Detroit to be the one seed at five to one odds,
*  which I really like because there's a whole case for Detroit,
*  but I just like the odds.
*  And the other team I really like the odds for was the Packers.
*  Yeah. And they were like, I think, 10 to one, something like that.
*  But I think the number one seed is going to come out of that division is my
*  my working theory. Green Bay.
*  Yeah, I see it on paper, especially like if love can match
*  what he did that second half of the season.
*  But there's also that's another team that's getting a lot of smoke right now.
*  I know. I'm driving the hype train.
*  They were awesome in that playoff game.
*  I thought they should have won.
*  Like, I feel like that should matter.
*  Like, they almost beat San Francisco.
*  They came fucking close.
*  That team's young.
*  It should be on the rise.
*  Their defensive coordinator sucked last year.
*  So I see it. Yeah, it'd be interesting.
*  All right. Number one, let's hear it.
*  Number one.
*  I've got the Seattle Seahawks, which will surprise a lot of people.
*  Love it.
*  Every year when I do this exercise, I look and I say,
*  who's going to be the surprise defense?
*  There's going to be a team that jumps up from being terrible last year
*  to top five this year.
*  Last year, my guess is where the Cleveland Browns, good guess.
*  And the Carolina Panthers, terrible guess.
*  So I don't always hit on all of them.
*  The game I've got the Seahawks I've got as my number one pick this year.
*  And for a couple of reasons, one is you just look at their defense.
*  The last five years, I think Pete Carroll was a great head coach.
*  He couldn't figure it out.
*  He tried to adapt. He tried different coordinators.
*  He tried different personnel.
*  Their defense was either mediocre or terrible every season.
*  So now you bring in Mike McDonald.
*  And I hate buying all the way into the hype this time of year.
*  But I can't find anyone to say a bad thing about the guy.
*  He did it last year. He already did it.
*  Awesome. And that Ravens defense was banged up.
*  But wasn't like he had like the healthiest season ever.
*  Like he was patching shit together.
*  I thought he was incredible.
*  And by the way, that Ravens defense the year before he got there.
*  Now, they were injured a lot.
*  They ranked 28th in defensive DVOA, and then they were top 10
*  each of the past two years.
*  So, yes, he's shown this ability to turn things around.
*  So I have a lot of faith in the coordinator.
*  And then I look at the talent and I look at the depth chart.
*  And I'm like, he's been a good player before.
*  He's been a good player before Leonard Williams,
*  Uchenna Nohoso, Draymond Jones, all these guys up front.
*  Their first round picks a wild card.
*  This guy, Byron Murphy, this defensive tackle with a lot of outside.
*  Who fell eight spots probably further than he should have gone. Right.
*  Yeah. Yeah. 16. That was crazy. Exactly.
*  And so Mike McDonald, one of his special skills in Baltimore was
*  he figured out a way to make all the pass rushers work together.
*  Or he would have these schemes where he would rush for.
*  But you didn't know which four were coming.
*  Is it going to be a linebacker?
*  Is it going to be a slot corner? Is it going to be a safety?
*  So it's it's a lot of teams are doing this in the NFL where they're saying
*  it's not a blitz like we're sending everyone at the quarterback.
*  We're still sending four.
*  But if you don't know which four are coming and you don't block them.
*  Now, all of a sudden we have seven in coverage and we're able to defend you.
*  He's a master at this.
*  His play calling was awesome last year and it was against good teams
*  like the San Francisco 49ers.
*  So I look at the mix there up front and then in the secondary,
*  Devin Devon Weatherspoon, big time player.
*  Rick Wollin had a bad year the corner last year, but was very good
*  the year before, like there's just talent there.
*  And so I think this is a defense that September people might be laughing at me.
*  Oh, my gosh. I can't believe you had him as a top five defense.
*  And but by the time we get to like mid-October, November, I'm telling you,
*  I think this defense is going to be playing really, really well.
*  And it's a reason why I've got the Seahawks overs on everything.
*  I mean, one of my favorite overs in the entire league, seven and a half,
*  I think is still the number of which I can't believe.
*  I think they're making the playoffs.
*  I think they're going to win 10 games.
*  I think Mike McDonald's going to be coach of the year.
*  I think it's going to be one of the stories of the season.
*  It's so funny, because we have not talked about this.
*  I have the most futures on Seattle of any team.
*  The seven and a half was like an absolute outrage.
*  I did the all the all down Fando, which was like plus 148.
*  That was like eight and a half.
*  I'm like, great.
*  I think they're going to make playoffs.
*  I have them for the playoffs.
*  I've had a sprinkle of NFC West action.
*  There's there's exact order bets you can do on a on Fando.
*  So if you think Seattle is going to win the division,
*  San Francisco is going to be second, Arizona third Rams fourth, 25 to one.
*  Fun flyer.
*  But but I think the Murphy piece, just being able to get somebody that was
*  clearly a top 10 guy, but everyone just went offense crazy this year.
*  And you land that guy, you really needed somebody in the middle.
*  You I agree with you on I love Pete Carroll, but I thought that he kind of lost
*  his fastball the last couple of years.
*  It happens. He's in his mid seventies.
*  You know, in the energy of McDonald's, you combine it with the home field,
*  which against the right type of team.
*  But then look at their first three.
*  They're home for Denver.
*  Bownecks first start.
*  They're at the Pats.
*  I think the Pats are going to be the worst team in the league home Miami.
*  They could be three and oh, heading into at Detroit on Monday.
*  And then after that, I mean, they just have some crap teams on the schedule, right?
*  They play the Giants.
*  They got a Chicago game later.
*  They get to play Arizona twice.
*  We'll see if Arizona's be good.
*  They got Minnesota at home.
*  I think they can get to 10 wins.
*  Yeah.
*  And I'm with you on the defense.
*  I think they have enough dudes on that defense that combined with their receivers,
*  which would you put their receivers like that?
*  It's like a top seven receiving crew.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I would say so for sure.
*  I mean, it all comes down to their offensive line, which it feels like we've
*  been saying about the Seahawks for like a decade, but what I like is they can win
*  in different ways.
*  They could win.
*  Their offense could be pretty good.
*  Their defense could be pretty good.
*  Like I like to go through and say what teams could have a top 10 offense and a
*  top 10 defense is like an exercise.
*  Very possible.
*  Yeah.
*  I think it's possible with that.
*  And the other thing I think McDonald's game management is going to be awesome.
*  Like in terms of saving timeouts, when to go for it on fourth down, when to go for
*  two, all those things that kind of the new school coaches are doing.
*  I think he's going to be very good at that too.
*  I think that's another area where he'll probably give them an edge over Carol.
*  Lot of Kenneth Walker buzz too.
*  Yeah.
*  He's definitely going to go two rounds or $15 more than I think people are going
*  to prepare for in their fantasy league.
*  Um, last thing was Seattle, the Gino piece.
*  He's not bad.
*  It's fine.
*  You can, you can win games.
*  You can get to nine, 10 wins with them.
*  So I don't know.
*  I like where they're sitting with the San Francisco Superbowl hangover combined
*  with brutal schedule again, combined with McCaffrey's already hurt.
*  I, you holding out Trent Williams.
*  They didn't practice all summer.
*  Like guys coming back from injuries that are key guys.
*  It's like, oh yeah, pencil men, but they still haven't totally come back yet.
*  It just feels like they're a whiff vulnerable.
*  I don't think they're going to go six and 11, but could
*  you steal the division from them?
*  It's possible.
*  I've got a one game difference between the two.
*  I've got the Niners 11 and six and the Seahawks 10 and seven.
*  So I've got it probably a lot.
*  And I might, I might flip that.
*  So we agree.
*  Cause you and I both believe in the new coach theory in last year, even with Sean
*  Peyton, like he made a valiant effort to like to the bitter end.
*  He somehow gets a, what'd he get to seven wins with that?
*  Shakey?
*  And he had eight wins.
*  Nine.
*  Um, so the ultimate candidates are McDonald's Harbaugh or Raheem Morris.
*  And then I guess you could maybe talk yourself into Dan Quinn, just
*  cause Rivera and Biannimi were so bad last year, but I guess those are the four.
*  But I think McDonald is the new coach guy this year.
*  He's probably the favorite.
*  I'm looking at Harbaugh and that Chargers team.
*  It's way too much than I should the roster.
*  I don't second easiest schedule in the NFL.
*  The guys won 70% of his games as an NFL coach.
*  And then he went and he won a national championship in college.
*  Like I can't turn away at that.
*  Herbert, maybe we get to line could be good.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean that, come on that Chargers team, like by the end of that
*  staley run was just a complete disaster.
*  So yeah, I think those are far and away.
*  The two, uh, new coach theories, the Seahawks and the Chargers.
*  All right.
*  She'll Capotti can read them on the ringer.com.
*  Listen to the ringer NFL show and awesome podcast.
*  You're on there all the time.
*  And then a little, little, little Philly special as well.
