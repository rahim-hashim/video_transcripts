# Why the 49ers Offense Is So Dangerously Versatile | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [January 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdXA5aO9-8M)
*  I've said it on the show before,
*  this is unprecedented multiplicity.
*  This is unprecedented versatility.
*  McCaffrey doesn't line up and run some routes.
*  He runs every route that they have.
*  I mean, they haven't run him on a deep crosser yet.
*  They will.
*  They're gonna do it.
*  He's gonna run right on you.
*  They play him like he's Wes Welker sometimes.
*  They're just like, go in the slot.
*  He's the fucking running back.
*  They haven't run sluggos.
*  What are you doing?
*  You can't, this is cheating.
*  He's a white running back.
*  They've never done before.
*  It's legitimately unbelievable.
*  So the versatility and then the fact that Kyle,
*  like four years ago, Kyle was wide zone play action,
*  wide zone play action, Sean McVay offense,
*  wide zone play action.
*  Like it was the base.
*  It was the foundation, the root of this offense.
*  Now they got 17 different run concepts.
*  They walked out in the same surface against the Seahawks
*  where they're under center, McCaffrey's dot in the eye,
*  and they have Kittle and Juszczak both as like H backs, right?
*  So tight ends, but off the ball and a little bit wide.
*  They walked out in that surface
*  and ran every run concept you can think of with no tip.
*  No tip.
*  There's no way of knowing what's coming next.
*  You're in bare front, we're going C gap.
*  You're in under front, we're going B gap.
*  It's never been easier to get a play dialed up
*  that the opposing defense is not built to stop
*  because of the versatility of this group.
*  And I haven't said the name Brock Purdy yet
*  because it doesn't matter.
*  It really doesn't.
*  It's Kyle being this-
*  And the way between this guy.
*  Yeah, they don't put him in any position
*  to truly hurt them.
*  Right, he's the guy who works himself in the position.
*  Because he's aggressive, he's nuts, he's reckless.
*  There's like four or five plays a game
*  where Kyle probably wants to grab him
*  by the scruff of his neck and tell him to chill out.
*  Just let the offense work for him
*  because he pushes the ball down the field.
*  This is, it's an incredible offense.
*  I've talked about this theme before
*  in the podcast over the years, I'm older than you.
*  And the one thing I've learned about the NFL playoffs,
*  and maybe it doesn't always result in the champion,
*  but I think it's a pretty good indicator.
*  When we get to this final eight,
*  which team does their thing the best?
*  Which team's best thing
*  is better than everyone else's best thing?
*  If you just even start from that basis,
*  it's a good way to think about it.
*  And I think what the Niners have with what you call
*  the multi-position, whatever the hell,
*  whatever you say, what was the phrase?
*  It's unprecedented multiplicity.
*  Unprecedented multiplicity.
*  You had it, the Eagles had it in the first part of the year
*  where it was like the totality of what they were doing
*  and what they were doing offensively with hurts
*  and the way they were able to have these two wide receivers
*  that could make real plays with a tight end
*  who was in the top five and their ability to run the ball
*  and their ability of their quarterback
*  to just kind of roll out and do stuff.
*  That was the best thing in the league.
*  And I think the Niners have unseeded it.
*  I think their best thing is the best stuff.
*  Yeah, when you said the playoffs is a lot about
*  whose best is the best,
*  my mind immediately went to the 2019 divisional round game,
*  or excuse me, NFC Championship game
*  where the Niners played the Packers
*  and Jimmy threw eight passes.
*  And they won the game just they ran like 400 yards
*  or something like just disgustingly absurd number
*  like in the first half of 220 and it was just absurd.
*  That game typifies Kyle
*  and the way that he thinks about football.
*  He's gone against the Dan Quinn defense that he knows.
*  He coached under Dan Quinn in Atlanta.
*  Richard Sherman had the soundbite on Kevin Clark's podcast
*  about how Kyle was calling plays
*  specifically to break rules that Dan Quinn has.
*  He knows Quinn's blood, he knows his DNA.
*  And so they played them in the wild card round last year.
*  And this was when the Niners were still running the football
*  a little bit more.
*  And the Cowboys did everything they could, man.
*  They had Michael Parsons playing like true linebacker
*  this time, remember, he wasn't an edge yet.
*  And they were running around and they were reading the motion
*  and they were splits in the gaps and it just doesn't matter.
*  Like once Kyle gets you kind of in the headlock, right?
*  It's older brother with a noogie, he done let go, right?
*  So you call uncle or mom comes home.
*  Like it's Kyle's ability to kind of step
*  on your pressure point and stay there.
*  It's really like, I made this comparison
*  on the Friday preview show for the NFL feed.
*  The same way that like Mahomes is just a head
*  above the elite quarterbacks.
*  Like I don't always say they're all elite
*  but like Mahomes is clearly a little better.
*  That's how I feel about Kyle and offensive design.
*  Sean's really good, Andy's really good.
*  There's no two ways around it, but Kyle's just got that edge.
*  And against the Dan Quinn defense that he knows,
*  Cowboys win, they better be scoring 45.
*  Like I think this thing has a way to get
*  like a barn burner for the ages.
*  Yeah, we didn't even mention the Niners,
*  their defense is good.
*  I think you can throw on them.
*  That's gonna be the key for Dallas.
*  And so if they win, it's probably a higher scoring game.
*  It sounds like we agree on the four teams
*  that could advance here.
*  KC, Philly, Cincy and San Francisco.
*  Even though we've said the appropriate caveats with,
*  oh, you know, Jacksonville who knows and giants maybe.
*  That's plus 571 on Fandall
*  if you think those are the four teams in the final four.
*  Cincy at KC.
*  That's a nice data quarter shot, yeah.
*  Yeah, Cincy at KC and the Niners at Philly.
