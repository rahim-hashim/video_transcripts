# Micah Parsons Is the Best Defensive NFL Player Since â€¦? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7ReVULAxIE)
*  All right. I have I wrote down the biggest stories from week two.
*  I'm just going to throw these at you.
*  Well, let's do I'll do your team just because you're here.
*  Yeah, let's do it.
*  Parsons is the best defensive player since when.
*  Oh, how far back would you go?
*  Because like the clapper today on TV was like, he reminds me of the it's like, stop.
*  Come on. He better shut up.
*  I don't need him.
*  Yeah, keep your mouth shut.
*  Clapper, just clap till your cheeks fall off.
*  I don't want to hear it anymore.
*  I was going to ask you to admit that Michael Parsons is the greatest defensive
*  professional football player you've ever seen.
*  And I was going to threaten to not get off the zoom until you said as much.
*  Well, as you know, he was my D.P.O.Y.
*  pitch for your post 450.
*  What's that now?
*  Oh, God. Well, here's the thing.
*  I don't know how many I don't know how many people listening to this
*  watch that entire game.
*  He wreaks havoc in that game.
*  Like he was this is the most dated reference ever.
*  But Fast Time's Reggie but high 40 years ago when they steal the linebackers
*  car and he's bad and he's just destroying the other team.
*  Yeah. So he's like, I was trying to think like Reggie White did this in the in the 90s.
*  Reggie White would just destroy games.
*  And I actually think he's been a little forgotten in history.
*  I think Ray Lewis was like this, even though he's a middle linebacker.
*  You just he would just dismantle everything.
*  And you're always aware of him.
*  And he was just so over the top.
*  Derrick Thomas had some stretches where he would just like destroy things.
*  But for the most part, since Ray Lewis,
*  I don't remember anybody looking the way Parsons did today.
*  New keep naming names.
*  I haven't heard any that match up to the caliber of one.
*  Mike Parsons, honestly. No, I I think maybe I'm crazy,
*  but I think he's doing it a little differently from those guys.
*  If you watch him, he's not offered much friction, you know,
*  and oftentimes his move past the tackle or past the guard or past the running back.
*  Whoever's blocking him, there's not even contact made.
*  Right. Just like a stutter step or something.
*  I know some of the guys, a lot of those guys that you mentioned that
*  that was part of their repertoire.
*  But I and now I know I'm going to jinx him about getting injured.
*  But I really feel like there's not even any any like
*  any physicality until he gets to the quarterback and blows up a play.
*  I don't know. It's almost magical.
*  I think he's got that mad magician from hard knocks working with him or something.
*  This is going to make you mad because I'm going to bring in basketball right now.
*  Mm hmm. Good. I'm sorry.
*  Well, 18 minutes we did good.
*  He's like watching one of those incredible basketball players
*  who can just get to the rim and you're just like, how do you get to the rim?
*  Everyone knew he was driving in the basket like John Moran last year.
*  And you're like, oh, John Moran's gone on the rim.
*  They can't do anything. He's just going to get there.
*  Parsons, it seems like when he wants to,
*  if he's like, I'm going to just stop this run play or like,
*  I'm just going to get to the quarterback, it doesn't really matter.
*  Who's blocking him? He moves around on the line of scrimmage.
*  So I'm going to try it over here this time.
*  And I'll just go right by the running back and get the quarterback
*  or hit him as he's throwing.
*  He's he's on a very short list.
*  As you know, I'm not I'm prone to hyperbole from time to time,
*  but I've seen all of these dudes that have mattered since LT
*  and LT is always going to be my number one. It's not negotiable.
*  But I'm with you. It's fine.
*  LT is great. He was the best.
*  He was the best. He was the best. He really was.
*  I would appreciate it.
*  Can you come up with a different name?
*  John Moran, I know what you're getting at, but can you pick someone
*  who's probably going to be in the league in three years?
*  Or like like the what late 2000s LeBron was like when his first two MVP seasons,
*  when it was just like when he had a head of steam, he was just getting in the room.
*  There's that nothing was happening to stop it.
*  Oh, I got one. Yeah, those are good.
*  How about Lawrence Taylor?
*  Well, that's a name I'm going to see me in a nickname like that.
*  Like what do we do to how do you pump this guy's rep up a little bit more?
*  I think Aroma was trying to call him Monster Parsons.
*  Is there something there? I don't know. Yeah.
*  What does he need? Something he needs like LT was so great.
*  And then we were also mad when Tomlinson took it.
*  Right now, you got to come up.
*  You got to be LDP. He doesn't work.
*  Yeah. Yeah, we got to figure something out.
*  Well, anyway, is he is he hate me taken?
*  That seems catchy. I don't know.
*  He's the best. He hate me.
*  He's the best defensive player in the league. Yeah.
*  And he's might be the best player in the league right now,
*  with especially if you watch my homes, I know my homes.
*  I'm not going to just grab the title from him after two games,
*  but he's in the in a direct conversation with my homes now.
*  And he's the biggest advantage you have if you're going to be like Dallas
*  is getting into Super Bowl this year.
*  All right. What's your what are your reasons?
*  Number one, they have Michael Parsons.
*  He's the best defensive player in the league, and he's absolutely wreaking
*  havoc week after week. So congratulations. I love him.
*  I mean, I think he was around 13 sacks last year.
*  I think he'll be around 18, 19 this year. He's good for one a game.
*  Fandel offered Michael Parsons sack plus Cowboys win at plus money.
*  I was like, oh, my. What am I? Why am I waiting?
*  I got to jump on that.
*  And listen, it was the Jets.
*  And again, it's a quarterback I think they can replace.
*  So and it's not going to be much different when they go to Arizona next week.
*  But yeah, man, this guy's a star.
*  Just just stay stay healthy, for God's sakes.
*  Yeah, especially there's two things.
*  Once one against bad offensive lineman or shaky quarterbacks,
*  it's you can just like he's like supercharged.
*  And then as these games go along
*  and the teams start getting a little confidence, you know, like the Jets,
*  there was a couple of moments that game was 18 to 10.
*  And you're thinking, well, if they get, you know, feels like they
*  they're getting a DAC a little bit.
*  They got a bunch of flags against them.
*  There's this one part of the game all the Jets fans are mad about
*  when it just didn't seem like they were going to get a call there for 10 minutes.
*  But they they were hanging around the Jets and then Dallas just put the game away.
*  But when's your first big test?
*  It's San Francisco.
*  Is that coming up for it?
*  I'm trying to figure out what's because I know we have.
*  Oh, then I have it. Arizona.
*  And then it's the Patriots.
*  We have you guys. Yeah.
*  I said this going fast.
*  That's your big test. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And then you get the Chargers. Yeah.
*  All right. So Patriots will do something.
*  Something stupid will happen October 1st against the Patriots.
*  You watch. You watch.
*  That'll be it. You'll I'll skip that podcast.
*  October 1st. Let me write that down.
*  Skipping podcast.
*  Are you done?
*  Next. You know how it goes with this team.
