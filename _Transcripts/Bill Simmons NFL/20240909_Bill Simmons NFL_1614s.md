# NFL Guess the Lines Week 2 with Cousin Sal  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-afiivxa_4)
*  Week two you beat me in week one guest lines. We guess the lines every week week to Thursday night
*  Is actually a pretty good game dolphins bills and we didn't talk I guess dolphins Jags was the one game
*  We didn't really talk about I didn't think the dolphins look good at all in that game and the game
*  Got swung by this crazy Travis ETM play where they're up 17-7
*  He's running into the end zone or in a Spiner style
*  Somebody pulls the ball out fumble goes into the end zone when you have the team where the guy fumbles into the end zone
*  It's one of like the top four worst football fan on the couch feelings, right? Oh, yeah
*  It's like oh my god, and then you're seven points off if you had the over in the game. That's that screwed up
*  Next play 80 yard Tyreek touchdown on a play that only he can
*  You know, we have to we haven't talked we gotta talk about the Tyreek thing. Yeah. Yeah, we didn't talk about that either
*  Yeah, I mean he was destined to score I made us bet plus 550 that he scores twice today after that, you know after they
*  Shackled him there, but he always scored once but yeah, when are you gonna be more motivated than after you're went after you're
*  Arrested even Scotty Scheffler was able to figure it out. Well, he seemed really pissed off about it after the game and
*  You know somehow this is another NFL tradition where
*  Some sort of off-the-field something
*  Becomes a major story and this is gonna be the major story over the next couple days is what happened?
*  Why did he get arrested? Who knows what and
*  Miami police and it just feels like this will be a
*  48-hour thing I was surprised that it didn't affect him because that touchdown that he scored
*  Was one of those he's the only player in the history of football who could have scored on this
*  Right
*  Cut it out
*  But you have to somehow do a 90 degree turn with two guys on you
*  But then keep your speed full speed but not go out of bounds and he's the only one
*  Is there any other other football player you've ever seen who could do that and remember to do the handcuff celebration at the end? Yeah
*  No, I don't think I don't think there is anyone but but uh
*  Yeah, they and you broke the news to us before we went live on about six minutes before we went live
*  Bring a pregame show. I was like out you're screwing around. This is you just trolling JJ
*  Who's a big Dolphins fan, but you know this stuff happens pretty regularly now. It's amazing. Yeah, well
*  for the Dolphins
*  They were about to go down 24-7
*  They get the fumble they get the touchdown the moment he scores. I got they're definitely gonna win then they end up gutting it out
*  basically, but Jacksonville
*  Completely fell apart. I had it written down
*  I know you had Jacksonville, but and we're used to Miami, but did it seem like there were more
*  Plays for Miami that started seven yards behind the line of scrimmage than ever before
*  Yeah
*  I mean you got all these speedsters and he's throwing these swing passes that are
*  Like five yards beyond the line of scrimmage and then I get they'll run eight, but it's only a plus three
*  Like I didn't think often so did you think too it was good in that game?
*  No, I don't like the game plan I don't know maybe it was miserably hot and you just go with the team ultimately with
*  When it's you know, Florida in September, it's hard to say Miami had ten quarterback pressures
*  That was one thing where I thought I didn't think their pass rush
*  Maybe especially in the first month without chub would be the same but they actually did it Jacksonville second half
*  When they had ten point lead punt punt red zone fumble
*  Turned it over on downs with just a classic stupid Doug Peterson play he's he's good for like four of those a year, right?
*  punt punt and that's how it went they got the ball back 17 17 to 13 left and
*  Lawrence got sacked twice and then the ball back and that's how Miami ended up winning
*  So that that was a pretty awful loss for Jacksonville, but I asked if I'm Jackson
*  I'm like we we win if ETN doesn't fumble like that games done
*  So anyway as we head to guess the lines for Thursday night
*  It's in Miami and I have Dolphins minus two and a half
*  You went a little high I said one and it's one and a half
*  Hmm. Let me just check it. Let me just make sure you get that one and a half. Yep
*  It's a good line right in there
*  It's a good line. What a weird week for Miami. They're playing two football games and they're gonna have this Ty Rico
*  Why was he arrested fiasco? Yeah, and that's just all gonna happen over the course of nine to six hours
*  And Daniel's trying out for boogie nights, too
*  Humidity was not good for whatever he's trying to do with his hair. I have to say it
*  They needed to play sister Christian while he's just zoning out watching some natural firecrackers
*  Our Sunday marquee game which we really need because there's only three late afternoon games
*  But we got a Chiefs Bengals game in Kansas City. Mm-hmm and
*  It's not a note there's no must-wins in a week to but the Bengals getting thrashed by the Chiefs and going down
*  oh and two for the season and
*  That I mean that that might be unrecoverable for them. So I have this has to be in the t-zone. I
*  Have chiefs by six. Yeah, that's what I had five and a half is the
*  Correct answer. Yeah, we should come up with a name for that because this is where we there's always a one on one team
*  That we're like, oh they have to win this week
*  There's no way this team's going on too
*  And then they do go on to and then they show that stat well like well only 12% of the teams have gone
*  Oh and to have made it right playoffs or four percent whatever it is. So
*  I mean, I don't think Cincinnati is that team. They're pretty hefty underdog in Kansas City, but
*  They seemed now granted this is why you get in trouble with weak ones over reactions
*  But they just don't seem as potent as they used to you know, and Higgins didn't play but they didn't have a running back
*  That scared me
*  Burrow didn't seem like himself chase that Pat's just took him out and they didn't really have a lot of places to go
*  Like they had a touchdown to Kaseki in the corner that I'm not holding on to
*  Yeah, because second has been bouncing around like he was in the paths
*  You know that was who they were kind of going to on a key play and then somebody else fumbled that in the next play
*  You want a pencil to Bengals in for 34 points offensively, right?
*  And I just don't think we're even close to that team yet. Well, I remember so when we did the over under pod
*  I
*  Had some of the alt unders for them and I think we talked about them
*  Because this is a Reheme thing. I know hold on. It's in another have all these different files
*  How many files do you have for this? There's a lot of I have to go to my AFC Masters
*  2024 file that's it
*  Yeah, they under eight and a half wins for them was plus 250
*  Under seven and a half wins for them was plus 440
*  Yeah, and it's like
*  It's seven and ten insane for that team after they lost that I wouldn't say seven and tens insane
*  No, we should hang that out. Yeah
*  We should talk especially after the slow starts every year the watchables
*  Somehow in a 16 game slate, I only have one watchable and it's Rams Cardinals in Arizona
*  This is a super fun game to own one teams, by the way division matchup
*  These teams have had
*  I want to say they've had entertaining games in the past
*  I feel like I've watched a couple of them and I don't I don't have it on hand
*  But I feel like these games are usually kind of fun at a wild card playoff a few years ago on a Monday
*  I think yeah, I have the Rams favorite and I didn't know whether to go one and a half or two and a half and I
*  settled on
*  Two and a half. Oh nice. That's what I had. It's one and a half
*  We tie
*  So it's one and a half. Okay
*  That's fair. You love Arizona teaser lava
*  You
*  Know there's just a good teaser team because if you take them past the touchdown
*  Mm-hmm, even if they're down double digits, you still feel like they can get the the cheapie to come back
*  You know what? I don't want to sound arrogant here. But a lot of times we would say I love this
*  I'm gonna bet it right after we do the podcast before the podcast
*  Post so that we don't doesn't move. We don't have that luxury anymore unless we do it right now
*  Like literally right now. Oh, yeah on YouTube right people like when people are moving the lines on us. Yeah
*  Fairly watchables, I have six games
*  The first one is Ravens
*  Raiders
*  It's in Baltimore and I guess the lines before I got to I watched the week one games
*  I did a preliminary guess. I know and then I then I changed to my picks after
*  This was one of the ones I moved after watching the Raiders
*  I think this has to be over seven. I have Ravens by seven and a half over the Raiders. Yeah, you get this
*  I don't know why I went light. I don't know why I love this Raiders team. I said six and a half
*  It's eight and a half. So you were a point off
*  This is gonna be tough sledding for the for the Raiders. So this is the no way they go oh one two team
*  Right. Oh the Ravens. Yeah
*  Yeah
*  Well and the Raiders
*  They could lose this game go on to but they're next to our Carolina home Cleveland home, then they have at Denver, right?
*  So the schedules in their favor gets me. That was the reason I like them. Yeah. Yeah, you did love their schedule. Okay, I
*  Like that spot for the Ravens, by the way. Mm-hmm
*  Man, it's gonna be hard not to tease them. Do we tease that now before it gets to nine?
*  You just got to nine we got a lot of viewers on it. It's nine and a half. It's 11 and a half now
*  All right, next one Jaguars Browns in Jacksonville
*  There's a chance that's gonna be super hot in this game. Mm-hmm
*  I
*  have the Jaguars
*  By three and a half. That's what I had. I'm gonna announce what I was off before. What is it?
*  Is it way are we way off? Oh, it's now it's the three
*  What do you think of the Browns defense today
*  They
*  It reminded me at times of what they did against Houston like they went most of the year without giving up big plays and then
*  They couldn't help themselves against Dallas. Yeah, and CD. It wasn't even extraordinary either. So
*  But Garrett's always a menace Garrett Garrett
*  Went up against our rookie and beat him up pretty good, but I was terrified. Yeah
*  Jets Titans is the third fairly watchable. I have this because the Titans
*  You know, I don't know this feels upset ish to me
*  Especially if the Jets win in San Francisco on a Monday night and it's like now they're gonna go to Tennessee and easily beat that and then
*  All of a sudden they're down 17
*  Nothing it's in Tennessee. I have the Jets favored by three points. I was a half point off. I said five it's four and a half
*  Oh, man
*  That is yeah respect for the Titans. I mean that love is that mayonnaise coffee drinking frick backward peddling
*  I'm so mad. Well, can we have to do the rankings?
*  I mean, I'm so mad. I'm so mad. I'm so mad. I'm so mad. I'm so mad
*  What can we have to do the rankings and players you you hate their guts in the
*  Real bad Levis is number one for you
*  You know, I'll never claim that someone's trying to throw a game
*  But he was just like I get it was like killed a man with the ball and he's just like get away from me
*  Get away from me take this and then and then he like throws a fit on the field
*  He's like watch that to go back and watch that that was sickening. They should not have won let alone covered that game. Ah
*  We're back
*  You know, I should have put Lions bucks in the watchables I apologize to the bucks I don't move that up
*  That's a mistake. That's a bad job by me
*  Lions bucks, so we have two watchables this week. It's in Detroit
*  Tampa the way they move the ball. I should have put that in that category. I have the Lions favored by six
*  Yeah, I was way off here. I said three and a half. It's six and a half. Hmm. I
*  Thought a little more respect. I don't know. What were they favored over other Rams?
*  Did they play for in round one or am I crazy?
*  They played around around to it. Didn't they play in the playoffs last year and the Bucks kind of hung around
*  Round to imagine that around to eight round to yeah, yeah, they were in that game. Yeah
*  Line feels a little high
*  Okay, next one for fairly watchables
*  Colts at Green Bay
*  And God only knows what this line is gonna be I
*  We didn't talk about Colts Texans
*  So let's do this right now before we do the college backers guess because I forgot to tell us on sex
*  That game was really fun the Colts the Texans ran 76 plays the Colts ran 43
*  But Richardson had three 50 yard plus passes that were completed
*  That one was that one of the craziest passes ever. It's insane
*  He was falling backwards and just chucked it Roberto Clemente Bo Jackson style like Dave Parker like a
*  300 foot bomb and
*  he appears and
*  He was super exciting. He was all over the place, but his
*  His highs are really high and his lows he was doing this. I feel you'll get that with the Colts
*  I'm trying to think like who is the fun team?
*  Maybe they're the new Chargers or maybe the Chargers will always be the Chargers
*  But I like the scoring potential to them. So the Texans ended up not covering that right, right?
*  It's why they're giving them a hand two and a half. I think we said that was our rat game, right? Yeah
*  And our overreaction game, but I don't know
*  Maybe we didn't overreact to that. I feel like
*  Richardson was not great but had I thought it was a day. Yeah house house had it as his wise guy lock
*  Houston had 26 first downs
*  They had 213 yards rushing mixing had 34 for 159
*  I mean 34 is by far I think his biggest output for yeah
*  Yeah
*  so you look at the box hurry like how is this close and it was close because Richardson made three insane throws and
*  kept them hanging around but
*  Kyle mentioned this actually when we were watching it. It was a
*  physical playoff II kind of game
*  I thought that was like the most playoff ish of all the early games for
*  How hard those guys were going and hitting each other and yelling at each other
*  Yeah, definitely you expected one of them to roll over by the fourth quarter
*  Yeah, now it's a bit the Colts are a little better than I thought
*  So yeah, I have I actually have the Colts favorite in Green Bay because I don't know who Green Bay's quarterback is gonna be
*  I have Colts by one and a half. All right, you're gonna steal this from me. I had one and it's three. I mean, I guess I
*  guess it doesn't have to be Malik Willis, but
*  My god even three is low if it's Malik Willis Tom Brady I
*  Guess if he came back he would have to he'd want the job for the whole year not for four weeks
*  I decided I do my talk weeks and then they go back into announcing. Yeah
*  That's right. Last one Steelers Broncos
*  House tried to get the name back door bow for Bo Nicks going and didn't take I don't
*  Another human being back door bow, but uh
*  He was pretty rocky. I talked to our friend Gus Ramsey diehard Broncos fan about it after and he's like
*  It's like I'm not gonna overreact talk to me in November, but he had he had one throw in
*  Cal and I rewound it
*  He threw the he threw a pick
*  He's starting a triple coverage and the ball was in the air and it hadn't gone for the interception yet
*  You could hear the announcer go. Oh, no
*  But the ball was still in here and hadn't been caught by the yet, but that's how bad the throw is
*  So he had a couple no place
*  I watched him a lot when he was at Oregon because my yeah goes there and everything and I
*  Don't know why I feel like that whatever they were all bad. I but I did see
*  Five throws I thought were good and maybe that was just the toughest place to play
*  He also has a bad history in Washington losing to that team last year
*  I can't say their skill position guys were knocking my socks off. That's the other thing
*  That was the other thing that is a that offense might even be worse than the Pats offense. Mm-hmm
*  At least we had Ramon Dre. I like it. I like where you're talking now
*  What do you think this line wait, what do we have this I have the Steelers favored in Denver by one and a half
*  Do I get this? Yeah, I said three and it's two and a half
*  I'll tell you this going from Seattle on the road
*  To home against Pittsburgh is not the way to start the season if you're a rookie QB
*  This day was defense is gonna go nuts. I love the Steelers in this guy. I might bet this right now
*  I might bet this as we're talking went up went up to six
*  Poop poop fact that five games. We have a five game poop fact that week two
*  Hello, I guess Seahawks Patriots does that qualify as a poop factor or fairly watchable
*  I like a lot of these games still. All right, I'll put them. I'll put the Pats in fairly watchable
*  So do we have to can we we usually take a team out of the playoff running? Can we knock out two?
*  Oh, I I have I have a spot for that. Oh you do. All right
*  All right, so Seahawks at the Pats, I think the Seahawks are favored
*  But I can't believe I'm not going to be able to get a spot for that
*  But I can't believe I'm saying this but it might be a winnable game for the Pats with that Seattle offensive line as Mike
*  Lombardi always says bad offensive lines don't travel
*  Right and they'll be traveling to England. I have Seahawks by two and a half though. Who gets this? I
*  Get it. I said four. It's three and a half. Oh
*  My god, are you gonna beat me again? Let's see
*  Why do you do this to yourself five six seven one two, three four five six. I am up seven six
*  I love a few more. I
*  Think this line settles at three
*  or two and a half
*  What do you think? Yeah, probably. Okay. Yeah. Well, Kenneth Walker has a red cross by his name. He was
*  Outstanding today. Oh god. Really? He's already red crossing it. Yeah. Yeah a little bit
*  poop fact of 49ers at the Vikings
*  So you don't think the Vikings are poop fact aid just because they beat up on the Giants
*  No, I think you're probably right. I think this is when they come down back to earth, but it is a short week, right?
*  Yeah, Cisco
*  It's in Minnesota I have 49ers by four I had four also it's five and a half. Hmm
*  You want to change that I mean I came over to watch some football today and he was saying how
*  Some he has some mole with football stuff. Oh and the mole was telling him
*  how Darnold was gonna have a big year in Minnesota and there's a lot of a lot of stats that
*  Back up him him being good. This is Chang. I don't know
*  Darnold was gonna be good for the Vikings and to watch out for Darnold. Yeah, I need names tell him I need names
*  We need a source
*  So 49ers five and a half next on it was a few years ago
*  Darnold like led the league in rushing touchdowns after three weeks like he does this sometimes
*  He had that run with the Panthers a couple years ago
*  I was like they might actually made the playoffs for them speaking of the Panthers their home for the Chargers. I
*  Was on my two and a half points here. I'll just warn really yeah, I
*  Have the Chargers by three and a half. Oh wow you went the other way you win. I said seven. It's four and a half. Oh
*  Why?
*  Vegas own hold on teams are
*  Just lighten this junk squad up by 40 because the Chargers like barely got to 22 points today and
*  All right, I don't know like they're laying more than five points when they can't really score points
*  I can see why that lines like that
*  Yeah, but you're about to about to wherever is whatever spot you have is in declare Carolina not playoff worthy
*  And once they hear that they're just gonna give up on the year. I
*  Am willing to cross off Carolina right now there you go all right
*  Right, I would also cross off the Giants right Giants. Yeah, those were my two
*  Have we ever crossed off two teams in week one? I don't think so, but how does either make a comeback?
*  I wonder I'm gonna check on a
*  fan duel really quickly
*  Because they must have the playoff odds, right?
*  they don't really have it now they just
*  They don't have
*  They do have the playoff odds. Oh, they do. Oh just Jetson now just for the two teams. Yeah
*  Damn it
*  Yeah, okay. Well here's why it's bad enough the Giants look as hideous as they did
*  But we're pretty confident the Cowboys and Eagles gonna be good right so yeah, that's four. That's four losses right and
*  I'm not by the way. I'm not totally confident on your team
*  Really what do you need to see I thought the Sean was that bad? I don't even know what to make of that game I
*  Thought the Sean was so bad. There was no way to even tell that much about either team. Hmm
*  can I say this though this goes on the reported and
*  Maybe I shit on running backs too much, but I know that's your problem with my team and a lot of other people
*  what are many problems would you rather have a
*  A
*  1200 yard rusher and an average kicker or
*  750 yard leading rusher and the best kicker in the freaking world that anyone's ever seen he lined up for 71 and it seemed
*  Like they might actually let him try it
*  Yeah, and when a fan's disappointed when they don't let your kicker try a 71 yard field because that's where I was like
*  This is a no-brainer. Yeah, let's see if you can do it right
*  Yeah
*  I think that guy's worth points when we're looking at lines and stuff like that even more
*  It's a good like what the way Tucker was I think that's a good point
*  I think Dicker is that good too and the Chargers I have dicker and all three fantasy leagues
*  And I think he's how many field goals that he have today like four
*  I think five
*  four or five
*  Four because he had a good look. Yeah, because he had 12 points in our in our fantasy league
*  But I could see him having like 40 plus field goals this year. All right, but he's not blasting 65
*  Yeah, I mean, it's like my god. No, that's a good point
*  Speaking of your team your home for the Saints. I threw this was on
*  What did you this is what do you consider this not watch? I put this in the poop factor. Oh really?
*  All right. I don't want to watch the Saints Derek Carr had 200 yards passing today. You understand
*  They didn't they didn't make me think any differently of whatever whatever they did against the Panthers I don't care fine
*  I'll move it to fairly watchable. So this is but this is your no way. They're gonna be three poop factor games then
*  That's fine
*  I
*  Have the Cowboys by five and a half
*  You lose on this I said six at six and a half. Oh, that's too high
*  That's stupid. So you're gonna beat me this week
*  So you're gonna beat me this week I
*  Got three games left. So eight two three four five six seven eight nine. No, I'm only up one. Yeah, there's three left
*  I'm left by half a point two and a half points
*  I'm sorry a half a point three points and one and a half you could you could do this
*  Washington at home against the New York football Giants, so you have
*  Probably the worst defense in either conference against
*  Maybe the worst offense in either conference. I don't know what to make of this game
*  I only know that it needs to be in the Vegas zone and I have Washington by five Wow, I
*  Had three and it's two and a half
*  Really I don't get it either because so you're gonna beat me when Minnesota gave points on the road
*  I was like what that's nuts. They can't tell me
*  That's nuts. They can't do that and then they made it worth while for the I mean, this is this should be probably higher
*  You know Washington moved the ball in that game their field goal kicker missed a couple kicks Kate York. Mm-hmm
*  I
*  Didn't think their offense was that bad. They just can't
*  they try to get Daniels killed a couple times, but
*  But I thought he got a little bit better as the game went on. I did too
*  I will say he seemed pretty skinny out there and I know I knew I know that he was skinny coming in and right
*  You know, but when you actually see him against all those giant NFL players
*  Mm-hmm. He's strikingly skinny
*  They're bigger in the pros for sure
*  He stood out like like skinny in a way like when he was scrambling and there were people coming at him
*  I had real fear for him. I was like, please don't get hurt Jaden Daniels been enjoying him Sunday night Texans home
*  for the Bears and
*  I have the Texans by four
*  Now you get this I had six and I had three and a half. It's six and a half six and a half Jesus
*  Well, that's Vegas saying they didn't like the Bears offense
*  You could tie me here and I'm off by a point and a half two three four five six seven eight nine one two three
*  Six seven eight nine ten. Yeah ten nine good guys one left. I'm off by point half
*  Okay. Well, I have it the Monday night game is Philadelphia home for the Falcons of Atlanta
*  And I have the Philadelphia Eagles by five and a half. All right, you got it exactly so I can't be too upset
*  I said seven I'm not buying this Atlanta team at all, but it is five and a half
*  Nice spot for the Eagles
*  Yeah, what do you care that as a Cowboys fan were you scared watching them with all the weapons?
*  I didn't like the Barkley thing at all
*  I thought their defense wasn't that great and but also it was it was so hard to tell on that field
*  Yeah, that was my ultimate takeaway
*  You
