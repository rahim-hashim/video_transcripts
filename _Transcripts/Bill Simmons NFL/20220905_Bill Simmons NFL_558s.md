# Can the Dallas Cowboys Come Out on Top in the NFC East? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9XQw9X3DMs)
*  All right, we're going to hit the NFC East.
*  I've been waiting for this all week.
*  I can't wait.
*  Your team, the Cowboys,
*  the Philly bandwagon started in mid, kind of mid July with the Sharps.
*  House, I knew you, I knew we were all in trouble with Philly bets when House went in early on a
*  giant Philly division bet and the odds have moved.
*  Oh, a giant gigantic.
*  Giant Eagles bet.
*  So the Eagles odds, they are now plus 145 for the division.
*  Look at it.
*  We're starting with the Eagles.
*  Well, I'm just, I'm going to get to Dallas.
*  I'm just giving you the odds.
*  Over under for them is nine and a half minus 145 action.
*  First seed on Sunday, they were 16 to one to be the first seed.
*  Now they're 10 to one.
*  Their playoffs is almost up to two to one on Fandel.
*  It's minus 198.
*  10 plus wins is minus 130.
*  And they won nine games last year.
*  So the case for them would be, how are they not one win better?
*  With all the stuff they've done, they nailed their draft pick Davis.
*  They traded for A.J. Brown.
*  They got the cornerback from New Orleans that everybody likes.
*  I know the year with hurts like so just irrespective of Dallas,
*  I think they are a 10 win team over.
*  Now the question is, what's going on with your team?
*  Can I ask the question?
*  Why couldn't they get more than nine?
*  Like, all right.
*  But I just, I think it was a stretch that they got nine last year.
*  We're good.
*  Finish up your team.
*  Yeah.
*  I think Philly gets to at least 10.
*  Your team's over under is 10 and a half.
*  It is now plus 105 to bet the over on the 10 and a half.
*  Not a lot of believers.
*  Right.
*  Can your team get to 10 wins?
*  You lost your left tackle until at least December time around Smith.
*  I wasn't crazy about your offensive line before that happened.
*  They've CD lamb moved into the number one receiver spot.
*  I don't think you were crazy about it either.
*  I was average.
*  I think it was overblown because I think like, like the Steelers defense,
*  the Cowboys offensive line is great for three years longer than it actually is.
*  Right.
*  So I think that's kind of it.
*  But you're right about that.
*  Look, you lost Gregory and you lost the Cowboys.
*  There's closed a little bit, but I think I still think the Cowboys are better.
*  Just go offensively position by position.
*  Maybe the Phillies are deeper.
*  Maybe they got the best Georgia guys on defense to stuff the run and the big hogs on
*  defense, but the Cowboys defense went down 10 points per game last year offensively.
*  You'd rather have Prescott than hurts.
*  You'd rather have the Pollard Elliott combination than Sanders, right?
*  Sanders is okay.
*  AJ Brown, CD lamb, I think is a wash.
*  The tight end, I think is about, I like, I think I liked Alton Schultz.
*  But it was offensive line is way better than Dallas offensive line.
*  That's the one difference.
*  Okay.
*  That's fine.
*  But it was, and they still won 10, 12 games last year.
*  I know, I know it hurts.
*  So you lost three, three, like a league guys from last year.
*  Yeah.
*  Did you add any league guys?
*  No, we didn't add any.
*  We took the Tulsa guy who like led the country in penalties.
*  So that's going to be a problem.
*  And it looks like he hasn't learned any lessons, but.
*  And you also had a coach that everyone thought was going to fire last year.
*  That's a fire back.
*  Yeah.
*  I can only shit on Nick Sirianni so much when I have Mike McCarthy, right?
*  But I'm going to go Cowboys under, keep it at 10 and seven.
*  I do think they went exactly 10.
*  And I have the Eagles on there also at nine and eight.
*  That's how we do it.
*  Okay.
*  I had the Eagles under the Eagles under.
*  No, I'm sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I had Dallas under.
*  Yeah.
*  I have the Eagles over and the Eagles, I think is one of my locks.
*  I do worry about the like digs had 11 interceptions and once you dig into it and dig into it.
*  But the interception luck.
*  Yeah, that's kind of, it's kind of lucky.
*  It's a luck.
*  Like the best interception guys have like four or five, you know, and to have 11 is right place,
*  right time or right tip ball, right time.
*  We open with Tampa and Cincinnati, two division winners, but then Giants, Washington Rams.
*  Cowboys are tied for the easiest strength of schedule.
*  I think they get it together and get to 10.
*  More likely they wait, they go 12 and five or Mike McCarthy is fired by week seven.
*  If you have to bet on.
*  Wow.
*  That's a good one.
*  I just don't think Jar has it in him to dismiss anyone.
*  So he's weirdly loyal.
*  What the hell's going on?
*  Does he think he's going to live to maybe figured he's going to live to like 105.
*  He's got this worked out.
*  Sean Payne is going to be your coach next year.
*  Yeah.
*  Doesn't it just feel like that's where we're going?
*  Yeah.
*  I think he can swallow his pride.
*  Jerry and hire him already.
*  Yeah.
*  That'd be good.
*  I have over fulfilling just FYI, the rest of this division.
*  Can I just say one thing?
*  I really, I'm just not a Hertz guy.
*  I honestly think like, I think Gardner Mentsch could win like five games with this team coming
*  in, mopping up like Hertz is like, you could have the best mac and cheese, the best mashed
*  potatoes.
*  You can have the best sides there, but if you're serving fried rabbit, there's an encore.
*  That's still, that's still your plate right there.
*  So I don't love Hertz either.
*  And we bet on Tampa and the playoffs and they just demolished Hertz.
*  And it was one of those moments where I think I just checked out on him as ever being a
*  successful playoff QB, but I don't think that matters in the regular season.
*  We saw Tannehill get to a one seed last year and Hertz.
*  What does he have?
*  Like 24 touchdowns, 13 interceptions, like 24, 13, I think is his passing stats.
*  And when he runs, he busts his ankle.
*  It seems like.
*  Our ringer fantasy rankings, he was seventh out of the QBs.
*  Like he was ahead of Joe, because of the rushing yards.
*  So stupid.
*  Washington, we don't have to spend a lot of time with them.
*  I got under for them.
*  Eight and a half, I think is the weirdest over under in the week.
*  I don't get it at all.
*  Is that what the Browns were too?
*  It's similar.
*  Yeah, you're right.
*  That's the weirdest AFC.
*  That both should be eight and a half.
*  This is a resounding under to me.
*  I like the six or less wins bet for them at plus two 10.
*  Wentz.
*  I can't imagine Wentz is in the NFL by the end of the season.
*  I just feel like this would be it.
*  Isn't last place like plus two 50.
*  You can bet on the exact record.
*  I like that too.
*  And I think Ron Rivera, his best years are behind him.
*  I think.
*  Well, here's another thing.
*  You mentioned the Chargers lack of home field advantage.
*  Who has a worse home field advantage than Washington?
*  Right.
*  House is calling him the C words.
*  He's a Washington fan.
*  That calls him the Washington C words.
*  But every home game, it's going to be just complete apathy or fans from the other team
*  or people who went because the tickets were a dollar.
*  Nobody's going to those games.
*  The thing is they do have winnable.
*  If you just look at this guy, they have winnable games.
*  I think they have, you know, the three extras are at San Francisco, Atlanta and Cleveland.
*  They have four games versus teams where they have a plus three day rest advantage, which is.
*  Yeah, they were a big rest advantage team.
*  Well, one thing with them, one thing reason why I was thinking of betting the under with them.
*  They have the Giants in week 13, bi-week Giants in week 15.
*  Yeah, it's weird.
*  So if they're.
*  Right around that number, you could probably hedge in some sort of way.
*  And knowing me, I would probably do it incorrectly, but I have a strong under for them.
*  Yep.
*  Seven and ten for me.
*  And then the Giants, I got excited early July because it seemed like your team was in trouble.
*  I wasn't there with Philly yet.
*  I was like, maybe it's the Giants new coach.
*  Dayball comes in, just kicking ass.
*  He becomes like this revolutionary.
*  Like when McVeigh went to the Rams and just flip them around,
*  they're going to be bad.
*  Do you think so?
*  I do.
*  I have them get into eight.
*  You do?
*  But they've had a weird week, right?
*  Like, Tibideaux goes down to that injury.
*  It should be okay eventually.
*  And then like this clips of Galladay not blocking.
*  So he still sucks.
*  And then what was the thing the other day?
*  Oh, they carted like Tyron Taylor off.
*  So.
*  Well, and then the receivers because people are well, Tony, it's like, all right, if Tony
*  plays eight games, that's going to be a miracle.
*  That guy gets hurt every week.
*  Galladay, who they spent all that money on, he's the people only he's going to wave.
*  And the Kentucky receiver.
*  We did a big fantasy pod on Tuesday.
*  And I think Heifetz was saying how if he had to pick anyone on the Giants to get fantasy
*  points, it would be Wendell Robinson, the rookie.
*  That's where the Giants are with this little receiver is going to lead them in receiving.
*  Yeah.
*  So I think under is where you look at.
*  You look at the, what is Barclay around 850?
*  All those guys around 850.
*  Did you get any overs for props this year?
*  No, I'm doing under.
*  Yeah, under is the most.
*  I was telling, I was saying this, like if I had a brokerage where I just took hedge fund,
*  like kind of like millions of dollars from people, we would probably waste it on money
*  line parlays.
*  But the smart thing to do, I swear to you, is bet all, especially running backs, but
*  wide receivers all under their rush total.
*  I promise by week 12, you'll have 20, 20 in already.
*  Right.
*  You do 50 under bets and you'll probably go 35 and 50.
*  Yeah.
*  Something like that.
*  I'm with you.
*  So you are over on the giants.
*  I went eight and nine.
*  Yeah.
*  Seven and a half is a little suspicious, but I kind of like it.
*  I like what they did and they're added three games or at Seattle and Carolina and home
*  for Baltimore.
*  Knowing you, you'll bet on this and the giants will be seven and nine heading into week 18
*  and the Chargers doctor is going to stab Tyrod Taylor again.
*  That'll be it.
*  He'll get knocked out.
*  He'd be lucky.
*  Tyrod Taylor.
*  They only have four playoff teams from last year.
*  They play and two of them are Dallas and.
*  Yeah.
*  Listen, I try to talk myself into it and I just don't think they have the talent.
*  It's really tough when you miss some drafts.
