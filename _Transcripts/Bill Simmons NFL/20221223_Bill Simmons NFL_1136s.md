# The Sneaky Teams in the NFL That Could Surprise in the Playoffs | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [December 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIF6OmWgQsQ)
*  You know, there's always that one team.
*  We have the top five that's established right now.
*  It's Philly, it's San Francisco, it's KC, Buffalo and Cincinnati.
*  And really, that's it.
*  And usually we have like seven or eight, but this year we only have five.
*  And the history says there's always at least recent history,
*  there's always one other team kind of lurking.
*  So you go back to 2021 after 14 weeks, the Bengals are eight and six.
*  Nobody saw them coming.
*  Well, they finished 10 and seven, they get a four seed.
*  All of a sudden they're in the mix and they make the Super Bowl.
*  2020 Tampa. Yep.
*  They're eight and five.
*  New Orleans. You were going to mention you were going to mention that last week.
*  And it's like when they lost to Kansas City, that Tampa team on a Sunday
*  afternoon with Romo and Nance on the call.
*  Tampa Bay went head to head with Kansas City, and they kind of like
*  were able to match, which they lost the game, but felt like something.
*  Felt like something. Felt like they lost the game.
*  I remember Romo said that at the end of that game.
*  He's like, I think Tampa's found it. Right.
*  You also said that about Tampa after what I saw last week.
*  I don't necessarily agree.
*  Romo just likes to it turns out Romo just likes to say that after Gabes.
*  This was also 2020 Romo, a different version, maybe.
*  OK, go right.
*  But the Saints were Saints were 10 and two and Tampa was seven and five.
*  There were three games behind the Saints end up in the division.
*  Tampa's a five seed, 11 and five to make the Super Bowl.
*  They went to 2019 Tennessee. Yep.
*  They're eight and five heading into week 15.
*  They lose to Houston.
*  They're eight and six seem like they're either done, maybe done.
*  They sneak in as a six seed, nine and seven.
*  They make their run.
*  They get to the AFC title game, go toe to toe with Casey and they lose.
*  I think there's three teams right now.
*  I love this. Who you got?
*  That could be the sneaky teams.
*  And we'll do Miami in a second, but the other two are Chargers and Detroit.
*  Detroit. Yeah.
*  Ain't on Detroit.
*  Well, so here's the case.
*  The the Dolphins.
*  So they fit a lot of models for this, like their eighth in DVOA already.
*  If you go back to the Super Bowl, DVOA, the last like 10 years.
*  Every team for the last six years was in the top seven DVOA,
*  except for Cincinnati last year.
*  And I'm willing to throw out Cincinnati as a complete fluke.
*  As Schrager and I, they murdered us a million dollar pick.
*  But I just feel like my home just makes one play.
*  Cincinnati is not in the Super Bowl.
*  Like they give the ball to the Raiders or the Titans.
*  Yeah, just any sort of just that stretch, the three minutes before the end of the half,
*  the three minutes after the start of the half, like just anything.
*  Make one play. And since then, it's not in there.
*  But after that, it's really top seven all the way down in 15.
*  Denver was eighth in DVOA and in 2012, Baltimore was tenth.
*  So we have those are three teams out of 20 in the last 10 years
*  that weren't top seven DVOA.
*  Miami's eighth, so they're lingering and they could get in the top seven
*  by the end of the year.
*  The Lions, they're ninth since week eight.
*  They're fourth in DVOA.
*  They're fourth out of everyone in the league.
*  They're sixth offense, 13 defense, fifth special teams.
*  They've won six of their last seven.
*  JJ, they have good losses.
*  They lost to Philly. They lost to Buffalo.
*  They lost to Miami. They lost to Dallas.
*  They lost to Minnesota.
*  They lost to Seattle and they got killed by the Pats.
*  That's the one like where you're like, what the fuck happened there?
*  Yeah. But for the most part, I'm kind of sold on the Lions.
*  Says, JJ, you disagree?
*  So listen, I love this story.
*  I want to see him in the playoffs.
*  There are a ton of fun.
*  Campbell scares me in game.
*  Oh, well, you saw last week against the Jets.
*  Yeah, he's kicking a 54 yard field goal.
*  It's frigid, freezing cold to go from three to six.
*  His team bailed him out.
*  His offensive coordinator is a badass.
*  And he can send some bouquets to Robert Salah for screwing up
*  the end of the game. I don't know what he was doing with the time management.
*  Tough one for Salah.
*  That's my biggest thing.
*  Like the Lions, to me, out of any of those teams trying to get in
*  in the wildcords outside of Dallas, they're the most likely to win a game.
*  I just don't know if they have enough to win their final three
*  and they need to win their final three if they're getting in.
*  Shraggs and I have Shraggs and I factor in the three weird Dan
*  Campbell decisions when we decide whether to put the Lions in the dark.
*  OK, fair enough.
*  We have. So this week they're at Carolina.
*  Mm hmm.
*  Carolina, I've finally given up on because you house you in the house
*  and I talked about this on East Coast Bias Tuesday.
*  Carolina is fine unless they're down seven and then you might as well turn the.
*  It's like they're down seven out of the games over.
*  Can I give you a Carolina Panthers perspective as I'm watching that game,
*  knowing that Bill and I had the underdog parlay and we were all in on the.
*  They OK, so C.J. Henderson, this is real deep Carolina talk.
*  If you're a Carolina Panthers blogger, C.J. Henderson goes down
*  and it's like, all right, your number two corner's gone.
*  They still are setting the house on every third down in this guy.
*  I know Taylor, who is not not that guy.
*  It's up against Deontay Johnson, literally nine of 12 on third down.
*  It was painful every time it was third and long.
*  They sent the house and Al Hulcomson, everybody.
*  And they're just picking on him with Deontay Johnson.
*  It was it was enough where you're like, all right, I guess Steve Wilkes
*  can't be the coach next year.
*  Like if you're a defensive coach, it was so bad.
*  Like, I think they got they got so excited to blitz Trubisky.
*  I know they kind of completely lost perspective of the game
*  because the only guy who could hurt them on the field was Deontay Johnson.
*  And he was by himself on the left side of the field, just Taylor.
*  Yeah, it's tough.
*  And from a coaching standpoint, I'm not sure.
*  But anyway, it's in Carolina.
*  We haven't even talked about how bad the weather is going to be
*  all over the place this weekend.
*  If the Lions are a real playoff team.
*  They have to be Carolina like and it has to be convincing.
*  So to me, we'll know after this weekend one way or the other,
*  because it's a rat line, guys.
*  The Lions only favored by two and a half at that crummy Carolina team.
*  After last week, the entire world is on Detroit, too.
*  But we had we had three rat lines last week and we went two and one on the rat lines.
*  Yeah, I don't I don't know this vernacular.
*  I'm not in this one. What is a rat?
*  So basically, I love this.
*  Basically, it's like it's it just looks too easy.
*  We've talked about it. We just.
*  Basically, it's too good to be true.
*  Like, I thought, for example, Cincinnati last week,
*  we have three and a half against Tampa.
*  They seem like one of those lines that was too easy to be true.
*  San Francisco, Seattle on Thursday night.
*  Why? Why is why wouldn't everyone take San Francisco?
*  Why is this so?
*  I ended up not bet in that game because it was such a rat line.
*  I'm so scared. Yeah.
*  But you're right that Carolina, Detroit.
*  So anyway, I still like Carolina.
*  I still like Detroit. I'm saying like, here's the other thing with Detroit.
*  Now, I know Dan Campbell is going to have a couple of weird decisions.
*  You mentioned the offensive coordinator, Ben Johnson, who I'm telling you right
*  now, guys, is going to be hired as a head coach at 36 years old.
*  He is all anyone text me about all these executives and in these.
*  What what do you know about Ben Johnson?
*  And here's the deal.
*  They're getting contributions from rookies who weren't contributing.
*  So like they added these.
*  This guy, James Houston, is a pass rusher who did not play till Thanksgiving.
*  A rookie at a Jackson State.
*  He's got five sacks in four weeks.
*  Jameson Williams, they added him in Alaska like they are adding players as they go.
*  So not only are they winning games, they're getting better personnel
*  and they're getting more momentum.
*  I think Detroit rolls and I don't think the Carolina fans are actually like,
*  you know, coming out in droves in this weather in Carolina to go cheer
*  on the Panthers this weekend.
*  Well, it's tough for them because two weeks ago and we had them.
*  They had that huge start against Seattle.
*  But second half, they didn't really do much.
*  And then in that last game, they didn't really do much either.
*  I think the same Darnal thing is becomes insurmountable.
*  The more you watch that, I was surprised they couldn't run on Pittsburgh.
*  But the Ante Foreman was tiptoeing last week, and he is not a tiptoe tiptoeing
*  to the line if it seems like I'm very passionate here.
*  I watched every snap of that game.
*  Yeah, we were going nuts for it.
*  The the Lions, though, I still feel like.
*  Like I'm looking at Washington at San Francisco this week.
*  Good luck. Washington's going to be seven, seven and one.
*  Remember, I said this.
*  Washington's going to be spunky in that game.
*  Spunky. I love the Niners and I'm invested in the Niners to win the Super Bowl.
*  They just won the division.
*  That's a kitchen sink game for Washington.
*  Young is back. I think they cover.
*  Just be careful there. Be careful.
*  Definitely not to be careful.
*  I was going to say, we can make the bet.
*  You saved me some trouble. So I'm fine with that.
*  Then they're home for Cleveland, Dallas the next two weeks.
*  So if they lose San Francisco and their seven point underdogs and Detroit wins,
*  Detroit is now in the playoffs, just need to win out their last two.
*  Yeah, so I think.
*  What's the most fun scenario for the playoffs, just in general, from a gambling standpoint?
*  It's the Lions making is it?
*  Is it Dan Campbell and Jared Goff and just being able to be like, what do we do with this?
*  Or is it Green Bay making this crazy?
*  Oh, come on down the stretch, because if they beat the Dolphins
*  and they win the following week, they play the Lions for what could be a playoff spot.
*  And then all of a sudden, you've got this Green Bay team in the Rogers storyline.
*  Like, I don't know what I'm rooting for.
*  I think they're both very intriguing.
*  I'm ready for Rogers to go away.
*  I'm with you.
*  And maybe that's because I have an investment with the Dolphins.
*  Let's flip the channel on Rogers.
*  Shregger, how about this one?
*  Tyree Kill returning to Arrowhead to take on the Chiefs.
*  You want a long game.
*  Oh, for week one. Oh, yeah.
*  All right. The Chargers,
*  which I think are the most divisive team right now.
*  For. For the playoff picture, because.
*  I want to get to that five seed if I'm in the AFC,
*  because I get to play their Tennessee or Jacksonville, Tennessee is seven and seven.
*  They play Houston this week.
*  They no longer have Ryan Tannehill.
*  They have three of their five starters out of the offensive line.
*  Everybody you go across the board.
*  And we always talk about the Shregs every year.
*  There's that team when we get to December.
*  They've just had too many injuries.
*  That's it. They're depleted.
*  You pass the point of no return where you're just not you're not the team anymore.
*  And it feels like Tennessee is at that point.
*  Malik Willis, I watched that game.
*  I think we had Houston and he just can't throw the ball.
*  They can't really do anything with him.
*  Berks, I don't know if he's coming back.
*  I want to play them or Jacksonville.
*  We're taping this before Jacksonville, the Jets will have a lot more clarity
*  on how real Jacksonville is in the playoff picture tonight.
*  But Baltimore or Miami or the Chargers,
*  I mean, for that five seed, you're talking about Tennessee, Baltimore.
*  I don't know if Baltimore is falling apart, too.
*  And the Sharks are in the water like a Greg Roman can't leave his house.
*  It sounds like they're just going nuts there in the local market.
*  This is another year where they have it all locked up.
*  It looks like they're on their way.
*  And then the offense just falls apart.
*  The numbers are crazy. The last five weeks, they don't have a touchdown to a receiver.
*  They have the worst ranked offense.
*  Sammy Watkins, how sad is that?
*  And he'll be like their number one.
*  And the thought is, all right, so fine, we don't pass the ball.
*  We don't do anything last week against Cleveland, that terrible weather.
*  All of a sudden, in the fourth quarter, they abandon the run
*  and Dobbins was having a day and Edwards have a day.
*  So the Ravens could be one of these teams that just falls off a cliff.
*  Also, they play Atlanta at home again.
*  Ten to banged up, raining, but I mean, you watch that team.
*  Yeah, you could see. Can't you see Algeer just running for 200 yards
*  and like winning six to three in that game?
*  JJ, there's a bet I love in that Ravens game.
*  But I want to go back to the Chargers because I heard you got to get all over the place.
*  There's this bet I love in the in the Falcons game.
*  Falcons to win the first half, Falcons to win the game.
*  Plus three forty because that Falcons are another team.
*  If they're down seven, the game's over.
*  They're going to get smoked.
*  But I think they could run on Baltimore.
*  What, Tyler Huntley?
*  Well, if they're going to win, they're going to have to win the first half
*  or they have no chance anyway.
*  So why not take the plus three forty if you like them?
*  You know, I hate that.
*  No, I don't. Well, I like Baltimore in the game.
*  I feel like as crappy as they've been on offense
*  after they choked up a playoff spot last year.
*  And I know Lamar is probably not going to play.
*  We're sitting here, what? Thursday, three o'clock.
*  Tyler Huntley. He's out.
*  The official he's out.
*  I just can't see Baltimore choking for the second year in a row.
*  And I got news for you guys.
*  If they lose to Atlanta this week, they are choking for the second year in a row.
*  So I think Baltimore hardball finds a way to do.
*  The one thing about the Ravens is the beginning of the year,
*  they were scoring a ton of points, they were yucking up leads.
*  The defense stunk.
*  Now they got their defense somewhat in order.
*  And the offense is an absolute nightmare.
*  I think it'll be a little better because what does Atlanta have to play for
*  in this game? I know you got to be careful with that.
*  An NFC title.
*  Yeah, stop it.
*  I know from the end of the season with six wins.
*  Stop it.
*  JJ, we're game back.
*  What game are you watching?
*  Stop it. Stop it.
*  You can sell me on New Orleans, baby.
*  Two and a half against Cleveland.
*  Then you could get the NFC title goal with them.
*  I can't with Atlanta. I can't.
*  Baltimore's fifth in DVOA somehow, which makes no sense to me whatsoever,
*  because every week it feels like they either lost or they should have lost.
*  It's somehow advanced metrics like that.
*  So the Chargers is a team that the advanced metrics do not like for the season.
*  They are 23rd.
*  They're in the bottom 10 advanced wise.
*  And yet the case for them, first of all, I don't think their quarterback
*  was healthy from that week two KC game for two months.
*  I just don't think he was healthy.
*  I think he probably had like what Mike White has right now.
*  It was just playing.
*  Mike Williams, just he's played maybe two thirds a year.
*  He's awesome when he's out there.
*  There's six and two when he has two catches, JJ.
*  Keenan Allen missed seven games last four weeks.
*  They're sixth in defensive DVOA.
*  They're eight and six, but they lost to Casey twice by three points each game.
*  They lost to San Francisco and they have some shaky Vegas.
*  They lost to the Raiders after up ten nothing.
*  Yeah, they have a couple of shaky losses.
*  But for the most part, I don't know, both and James are questionable this week.
*  But in general, this is a Herbert play.
*  This is just like, all right, what if Herbert just goes on a run now?
*  We've seen this happen before.
*  And I don't know, man, if they if they can pull off this week.
*  And kind of get someone they're playing the Colts Colts start Nick
*  Foles on Christmas night, charges favored by four and a half.
*  Feels a little like a rat line, JJ.
*  But for the most part, are you buying the charges at all
*  or are they just to stay away to you?
*  So confession, I bet the Chargers at the beginning of the year
*  to win the Super Bowl two or three weeks ago, I was completely out.
*  I said this was a donation.
*  I can't believe I got invested in this team knowing the history of this team.
*  Well, what happens? They beat the Dolphins on Sunday night.
*  They look amazing on Sunday night.
*  Last week, I had Tennessee plus three.
*  That game was not even that close.
*  They should have won that game by double figures.
*  They're a different team.
*  Should have. You're right.
*  When Mike Williams and Kenan Allen are out there.
*  They can put up points now.
*  They are the Chargers.
*  This game against the Colts scares the crap out of me.
*  They played Denver at the end of the year.
*  Remember, they played Denver in that ugly, hideous Monday night game.
*  They should have lost that Monday night game.
*  I could see Denver playing spoiler there.
*  I think the Chargers are the sort of team.
*  Shrager, if they get in, I think they're insanely dangerous.
*  But you can't rule out the possibility of Chargers
*  things happening over the next three weeks.
*  OK, well, they trade shrinks.
*  This is why it's important.
*  They could sneak in and immediately be favored in round one.
*  I know. Easily, easily.
*  And they could be healthy at that point, too, for the most part,
*  except for J.C. Jackson.
*  Kyle Brant on the Good Morning Football Show with me.
*  He had a hilarious bit.
*  He goes, bring up their schedule and it says Colts, Rams, Broncos.
*  He goes, that scares the shit out of me.
*  If you're a Chargers fan, you'd almost rather see bangles,
*  you know, bills, sheeps, because this is where the scar tissue starts to play.
*  And it's like, are you going to slay that dragon once and for all?
*  Because this is real.
*  Some franchises are just snake bitten.
*  And this is real.
*  And this is a classic type of stretch where the Chargers would screw the pooch.
*  But if they can get over that hump, they might not have to hear about this anymore.
*  They might not have to hear about Marlon McCree.
*  They might not have to hear about last year, what happened in Las Vegas on week 18.
*  This is a huge game for them.
*  And if they come out and they beat the Colts by 20 points, which they absolutely should,
*  the Colts should be completely done.
*  They have nothing left to play for.
*  Everything is over. Nick Foles is out there.
*  But if this is another nail biter like last week was, there's real scar tissue there.
*  And I know I'm friendly with people in that organization and they get really pissed about it.
*  They're like, what is what is what is something that involved Nate Kating in 2005?
*  Have anything to do with Cameron Dicker and our team now?
*  Like, why are we talking about old Chargers?
*  Like, that's ridiculous. New coach, new everything.
*  And yet there is almost this grim reaper that is like hovering over that logo.
*  And until they get in the playoffs, I think every Chargers fan knows you got to bite
*  your fingernails because it's not a sure thing.
*  Well, as you know, nobody believes in baggage with a franchise more than me.
*  I'm the number one. I mean, we the Pats beat them into the Rex Grossman year.
*  Yeah. The game was over.
*  They they had the game winning.
*  Arlen McCree, he fumbles away.
*  Troy Brown strips it to get the ball back.
*  It's like the lights out dance.
*  It might have been the single flukiest play of the entire Patriots dynasty.
*  And then the Pats go next week and they almost make the Super Bowl.
*  They don't. But but they've had think about how many games Marty Schottenheimer
*  where they're like seven point favorites, eight point favorites in the playoffs.
*  They blew the number Sean Ellis.
*  Sean Ellis running all over them in the in the Jets and Sanchez going in there
*  and winning a playoff game, right?
*  The Jets, Nate Kating, missing field goals.
*  And last year, the freaking Raiders.
*  I know Herbert saving them on fourth and 18.
*  They still don't win.
*  So anyway, it's the most fun, I think, if.
*  Just for football, if they make it and Miami makes it and Baltimore doesn't make it,
*  because I think Baltimore is torturous to watch.
*  I don't think Ravens fans like watching them.
*  So if you had to say rock, paper, scissors, but to make it,
*  I'm giving you the Ravens, I'm giving you the Chargers
*  and I'm giving you the Dolphins.
*  What are your two, JJ?
*  I think all three can make it.
*  Technically, all three.
*  OK, you don't know.
*  Well, here's the team you got to throw in there as well.
*  And it definitely not as sexy, but they have a big one Thursday night.
*  That would be the Jets.
*  Yeah. Or your team.
*  If your team by now, my dad sent my shoot my team to the sun.
*  They're done. I still throw them in there.
*  But out of those three schedule favors Ravens Chargers.
*  But I think field wise, Chargers, Dolphins.
*  I think the Chargers and the Dolphins are better teams than Baltimore.
