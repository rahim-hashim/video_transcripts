*  So Thursday night.
*  This is really when sports goes a little haywire.
*  When we have these baseball games that have these increasing importance, we have the Thursday night football, we have basketball about to start.
*  Now WNBA finals, which I actually care about.
*  I forgot to tell you this.
*  Yeah.
*  We replaced Atlanta, Carolina on one of the four TV screens with.
*  Oh, you did.
*  Yeah.
*  Liberty.
*  The second half of Liberty links.
*  It was quite.
*  It was the most important moment.
*  They're saying ever for the WNBA.
*  Some people say it was Caitlin Clark getting drafted.
*  Others say it was when they replaced an NFL game on my TV on a Sunday.
*  Switching it over.
*  Wow.
*  I just switched it over.
*  We watched the second half.
*  Well, the Panthers Falcons had no right being a late afternoon game.
*  As I got to that was that was the case.
*  It's like, why is this game a late?
*  Like this game shouldn't be on now.
*  So I don't feel bad.
*  You know what else had no right being late afternoon?
*  The WNBA finals.
*  I know.
*  Put it on Saturday and Monday, whatever.
*  Come on.
*  Well, there was so they have all this.
*  I did some digging.
*  They had all this pre done ABC stuff, but I think they know they have to fix this.
*  Their counter to it though, is that the counter program and the overlap isn't as big as.
*  You know, you would allegedly think if they had data supporting that God bless them.
*  But I the point is you want people like us who are just going to watch football.
*  If there's four good football games, even if we have money on the links, I went to game one of the WNBA.
*  By the way, that was awesome.
*  That game one.
*  That was an awesome sporting event.
*  I couldn't believe it.
*  It was so good.
*  Their fans were great.
*  The Liberty fans like they're like really literally great fans, like knowledgeable.
*  They're calling out like illegal screens and like that like real diehard fans.
*  And there was great drama.
*  There's good shot.
*  The game was awesome.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a crazy call at the end.
*  The skill of the players.
*  I know.
*  I know they were the best in the world really for the whatever.
*  But the shot making in the skill that they have now is pretty nuts.
*  The slashing kick.
*  It was really good.
*  But I had a great time and then the Liberty won today.
*  So now it's best of three basically the next two.
*  We have the links.
*  Come on links.
*  We game three is probably the hedge.
*  You think so?
*  I do.
*  Because the fact that the Liberty were up by I think 15 plus in both games is a bad sign.
*  I never like having the team that fell behind by 15 in each game in the first two games.
*  The hedge is one.
*  Liberty's favorite, you know, by three.
*  In game three?
*  Well, maybe we ride the links.
*  Yeah.
*  All right.
*  I mean, that's opposite of a hedge.
*  But yeah, yeah, I'll go with that.
*  Ride the links.
*  Maybe we hedge game four.
*  Hope they win game three.
*  That's the move.
*  I mean, the move was to hedge today with the Liberty, but the line wasn't good enough.
*  All right.
*  We're distracting everybody from guest lines Thursday night.
*  Saints home for the Broncos.
*  This was the Spencer Rattler Bo Nicks game.
*  Everybody's been dying for really since the draft last April.
*  What do you think of Spencer Rattler?
*  Just out of curiosity.
*  I was excited from the beginning, but I like I said, I bet Tamp in the second half.
*  I'm like, I don't know.
*  But did you think he was competent?
*  Like what was your take?
*  Yeah, I thought he was fine, but they got some weird.
*  They had good field position for most much of that first half, right?
*  Like there was some Baker turned it over a couple times.
*  If you had a block kick in there.
*  So I was trying to be calm about I know it's exciting when a new quarterback steps up.
*  But I didn't get there in the headlights.
*  No, I thought he could move and I actually thought he had pretty good moves when he was in the open field.
*  Like he's not like going into a slide.
*  Like he was trying to juke people and get by people.
*  His passes little erratic, but somewhat smooth.
*  I didn't think he was bad.
*  I didn't my takeaway was like that guy's not a starter.
*  Like I didn't feel that way.
*  I felt like it's probably a low end starter.
*  Yeah, it's fine.
*  Yeah.
*  Can I just say something though?
*  I feel like I don't know if you saw this past Thursday, but they were promoting this Denver New Orleans game and in the graphic.
*  Can you guess who was in the graphic?
*  I know you said like, oh, Rattler and Nix, but.
*  I guess Alvin Camara and Sean Payton.
*  Very close.
*  Who is Sean Payton and Cam Jordan?
*  I love when they put the coach in there.
*  I love it.
*  Sean Payton and Cam Jordan and Cam Jordan, the incomparable Cam Jordan.
*  I mean, he's a great player, but they almost feel like they should give you a little money off if they're putting the.
*  Coach in the graphic matching up the teams.
*  Now my computer is saying it needs my battery charger.
*  Oh, you see I'm going to throw the Sunday marquee chiefs.
*  Well, we didn't get it.
*  Yes, Denver.
*  Oh, we didn't.
*  We got Saint.
*  We didn't get Saint's Broncos.
*  No, I have Saints by three over the Broncos.
*  Oh, I had one and it's one and a half.
*  And so if you run out of battery, I win.
*  Guess the lines, right?
*  That's stupid.
*  I just got to wait.
*  Bleed the clock here.
*  So here we go.
*  I'm sorry.
*  Chiefs at the 49ers is our Sunday marquee game.
*  I have the chiefs favored at the 49ers.
*  Chiefs by one and a half.
*  That's exactly what I had, but they have 49ers by one and a half.
*  Oh, make sure that that has a shot.
*  Wow.
*  I'm really surprised, too.
*  I'm surprised.
*  I'm surprised.
*  I'm surprised.
*  I'm surprised.
*  I'm surprised.
*  I'm surprised.
*  I'm surprised.
*  I'm really surprised, too.
*  Wow.
*  Can you do that?
*  Can you have chiefs still in the Super Bowl?
*  Can you have Mahomes to win MVP for all the top of your odds boards, but then have the
*  49ers as a favorite?
*  Three and three.
*  I don't need to look this up.
*  Mahomes' record when he's an underdog by between one and four points is like 120 and two.
*  Yeah.
*  So I don't think there's been a better, more fun bet over the years than that, right?
*  I don't think there's any doubt that you're putting the chiefs in a teaser and just waiting,
*  just waiting to see who we could throw them in with.
*  See, now John Ewing or, yeah, we like John Ewing.
*  John Ewing is going to be like, I heard Bill say that Mahomes is actually, he's four and
*  seven when he's between one and four points.
*  It'll be a better than 120.
*  That'll feel stupid.
*  Man, 49ers favored.
*  That's a lot of respect for a three and three team that really could have lost to Seattle
*  last week.
*  Well, this is the hang the Super Bowl chip on the shoulder game, I guess.
*  I guess that's the only way to do it.
*  I like 49ers first half chiefs game.
*  The bet that I've been clamoring for Fando.
*  I, I, they wanted me to tweet out one today and I did the Cousins house special for the
*  Steelers game.
*  I thought we had it.
*  I know.
*  Yeah, Vegas first half Steelers game.
*  It was seven to one.
*  I know.
*  There was, it was that one field scored and ruined it.
*  Yeah.
*  That'll hit.
*  I was like, this is perfect.
*  They're doing better.
*  Yeah, I have it every week.
*  Watchables.
*  We have three.
*  The first one's really good.
*  Packers Texans is a nice one.
*  That's in Green Bay.
*  I'm excited to watch it.
*  Two teams that I like how they're playing to well coach teams, two teams with fun quarterbacks,
*  two teams that can occasionally look awesome running the ball, two teams that occasionally
*  look like they can have an awesome pass rush.
*  And I have the Packers favored by two.
*  That's what I had.
*  It's two and a half.
*  It's right there.
*  Next one Falcons home for the Seahawks.
*  Seahawks started out three and three and a oh, another three and three.
*  I got this exactly.
*  Well, I did too because this one seemed pretty obvious to me.
*  I had the Falcons by two and a half against Seattle.
*  Why was that obvious?
*  You did get it.
*  You did get it exactly.
*  Because it wasn't going to be three.
*  Three is the one you say, oh, it's obvious.
*  It's three.
*  Well, two and a half is the new three.
*  I guess so.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like it used to be three and then it started taking peptides and now it's dropped
*  down to two and a half.
*  Yeah.
*  The peptides have changed everything.
*  Everything's thinner.
*  Last one is I feel like I've watched a lot of Falcons this year, by the way.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And once a game, Kyle Pitts is wide open for like 40 yards and then he's just he's like
*  a cat.
*  You know, he just he just runs away and you don't ever see him again.
*  Like what happened to Kyle Pitts?
*  I don't know.
*  I think he's outside.
*  He saw a mouse and he's gone.
*  But once a game, he's just wide open.
*  Nobody near him.
*  This could be.
*  I know that the records are fine.
*  Four and two against three and three.
*  But this could be the ultimate stay away.
*  I mean, good luck trying to figure out.
*  That's a tough defense is really bad the last couple of weeks.
*  Yeah, something.
*  Something's scary about betting on the Falcons is when they're failure.
*  And I don't know what it is.
*  Even today against the Panthers, we're cleaning up, taking care of business.
*  But even that game, like, oh, God, here they go.
*  Yeah, they're going to win 21, 20 Falcons game.
*  Right.
*  Last watchable is Lions at the Vikings.
*  Why isn't this the Sunday marquee game?
*  But Forty Niners Chiefs, it's a Superbowl rematch.
*  I mean, come on.
*  So Lions Vikings, awesome game, classic game.
*  It's in Minnesota and they're not going to be favored even though they're five and
*  oh, it's going to be Lions by one and a half is my prediction.
*  All right.
*  I'm going to get this even though I was off too.
*  I said Lions by one.
*  It's Vikings by one and a half.
*  Whoa.
*  All right.
*  So you have your teaser.
*  Go get it.
*  Detroit, Kansas City, the road teams.
*  I'm just betting the Lions straight up.
*  I'll do respect to the great people of Minnesota, but I just, I, the Lions have not caught up
*  with the Lions yet.
*  Three weeks in a row where even the game today, I don't know the three points was, how are
*  they only three point favorites against Dallas without, you know, the injuries you guys have
*  had, the fact that you can't run the ball and that you fall behind every other game.
*  Well, that's maybe the case against them.
*  Like, does that screw up a team after they play a dreadful, just the hideous asshole
*  team like the Cowboys?
*  Maybe they just can't when they then the next game is on the road against Minnesota.
*  Can't adjust.
*  Do you want to tape a hypothetical video?
*  We'll just bank it in case McCarthy gets fired tomorrow and they hire Bill Belichick or
*  somebody.
*  Is it just me laughing?
*  No, it's like, all right, this is a futuristic time stamp.
*  We're dating that we're taping this 928 Pacific time Sunday.
*  Sal, the Cowboys just fired Mike McCarthy.
*  I can't believe it.
*  What's your reaction?
*  Well, first of all, I had no idea Jerry Jones had died.
*  I mean, I feel like you would you would have led with that first.
*  So Steven Jones stepped in there and hired old man Belichick.
*  But he did rest in peace, Jerry.
*  We're going to do great things.
*  Coach Belichick, the greatest that ever was, is going to lead this team to a Super Bowl
*  that you'll unfortunately not see because you're clearly not around for this.
*  It's an emotional time for me because I love Belichick and it's always fun to
*  root against Dallas.
*  But now Belichick's coaching the Cowboys and, you know, I'm going to want them to
*  do well.
*  Love it.
*  All right. Throw that, Kyle, cut that out just in case.
*  Fairly watchable.
*  By the way, Brady said something during that Lions game.
*  No, he caught it.
*  He said something that wasn't like, whoa.
*  He was raving about their offense and he had a quote.
*  And I heard it in real time.
*  And then I think it became a little bit of a thing online.
*  But he had a culture.
*  That would have been he was talking about the Jaguars culture is really envious of it.
*  No, he's basically talking about their offense.
*  He was like, I would love to be in charge of an offense like that.
*  I still think Brady's sitting there for like San Francisco, the Chiefs or the Lions.
*  If any of their quarterbacks got down, I think he's on the first plane.
*  It's like, what about the Raiders?
*  They'll done.
*  No, I forget it.
*  Screw the Raiders.
*  Like he's back.
*  He posted a workout photo the other day.
*  He's like in the greatest shape he's been in.
*  It seems like I just feel like he's in hibernation.
*  He's like in a fire extinguisher case in case of emergency.
*  Goat quarterback available.
*  You think everything's a diversion?
*  You might be right.
*  Like the broadcasting, everything's like just a decoy to get.
*  I'm going to own this team.
*  It's just a super weird thing to say.
*  Like Aikman wouldn't say that.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  Like Aikman would be like, man, I would love to be in a charge of a team like that.
*  It'd be like he would never say that because he's fucking retired.
*  Brady said it in a way that it's clear he hasn't like totally given up playing football yet.
*  You don't say that unless you still want to at least a PCU wants to play football.
*  Well, Romo called the go the commanders, the Redskins today.
*  So I feel like he wants to play too.
*  He definitely seems like he wants to go back.
*  He thought it was 2013.
*  Yeah. Yeah, that's good.
*  I couldn't find that thing.
*  All right. Next.
*  Fairly watchables.
*  Do you did you miss that?
*  There's a London game.
*  I'm I have it right here.
*  Oh, OK, sir.
*  I didn't want to talk about Jags Pat's coming out of the gate.
*  I wanted to bury it in the middle of a small science.
*  Fairly watchables because Drake May is now fairly watchable for the rest of my life.
*  I'd bump it up, man.
*  Super. I'm excited.
*  I'm actually excited to wake up for this one.
*  All right. Let's move it up to the watchables then.
*  Fine.
*  I mean, the best part would be if Lawrence sucked again and Mack Jones came in.
*  Sure.
*  And it was Mack Jones against Drake May.
*  I don't know what I would do at eight in the morning Pacific time with my coffin.
*  I didn't kick my barrel.
*  We're in that. Yeah.
*  I have this in the Vegas zone.
*  I have Jags minus five against the Patriots in London.
*  Are you going to steal this from me?
*  I had three and a half.
*  It is four and a half.
*  Maybe you are the worst team.
*  That's a high number for a bad favorite.
*  I'll tell you this.
*  The the Pats culture on their sideline is going to make Doug Peterson feel better
*  about his culture.
*  Anyone alive over there?
*  What's going on?
*  It's a culture clash.
*  They start the game today.
*  It's Drake May's first game.
*  They announced it on a Tuesday for reasons that remain unclear.
*  Right.
*  Let's remove all the mystery.
*  Fans are fired up.
*  Kyle showed up before 10 o'clock at my house for the first time, I think, ever.
*  And it's like, here we go.
*  We get the ball, two awful runs into eight guys setting up the third and nine.
*  So he could sail it out of bounds because he's under pressure.
*  It's like we had all week.
*  Those were our three plays.
*  Nothing could have come up with one special wrinkle for Drake May's first series.
*  That's what we're going to do.
*  It's just an abysmal.
*  It's like we're leading with a song that's off the new album that no one's heard.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  It's just like, about a play act rollout.
*  How about somebody in motion?
*  A quick pass, like something to just get him going.
*  Can we have Kyle come on for a second?
*  I just want to write down.
*  Give me a grade A through F Kyle for Drake May today.
*  Oh my day.
*  Wrong person asked.
*  Really?
*  He's over the moon.
*  Go ahead, Kyle.
*  Kyle, you've had a few hours to think about it.
*  I'm going to say A.
*  I'm going to say A.
*  If there's a learning curve, if there's a comparative, it's A compared to everything
*  else we've had.
*  I'm going to say A.
*  I'm going to say A.
*  I'm going to say A.
*  I'm going to say A.
*  I'm going to say A.
*  I'm going to say A.
*  I'm going to say A.
*  I'm going to say A.
*  Yeah, especially when you think the rookie quarterbacks.
*  Yeah, he had like 10 really good throws.
*  And the other thing was, think about the rookies the first week of the season.
*  None of them look good.
*  Right.
*  And now, Drake Quantum.
*  We lost by 17.
*  Yeah, that's true.
*  Listen, I want this to happen.
*  You don't even have to watch the Celtics the first three weeks.
*  You got Drake May, this is fun.
*  It's we're deep in this season, man.
*  We're already having is.
*  conversations, like he's had some drops.
*  He's, I think he's got 24 targets and like nine catches.
*  Um, yeah, the pats are back, baby.
*  I love those Titans in Buffalo.
*  It's either seven or seven and a half.
*  And I'm going to say seven.
*  Good bills by seven.
*  Glad you said that.
*  I said seven and a half.
*  It's eight and a half.
*  Oh Jesus.
*  Might be the biggest on the board.
*  Might be.
*  I don't want to say.
*  Yeah.
*  Eagles at giants.
*  Somebody is going to be super unhappy with their bet coming out of this
*  game would be my prediction.
*  What do you mean?
*  This is, this might be a don't bet.
*  This is a DNB.
*  I'm declaring this a DNB.
*  Yeah.
*  How do you feel good about yourself?
*  No matter how this goes, this is the Saquon Barkley revenge game.
*  Right.
*  I mean, that's all there is to it.
*  You were waiting for him to bust one open today, right?
*  So to put the Browns money line, that's to death.
*  Eagles minus one and a half is my guess.
*  I get this one too.
*  It's Eagles minus three and a half.
*  I said two and a half.
*  That's fucking stupid.
*  That's a dumb line.
*  That's going to come down.
*  Eagles aren't good.
*  I don't know how many weeks in a row can we watch the Eagles not be good
*  before we all agree that they're not good.
*  Who get, who's revenge is it though?
*  Who's, who's angrier?
*  Like if you were to move a line a half a point.
*  Saquon gets it.
*  Saquon and Giants, they don't mean, I mean, the Giants only scored seven points today.
*  All right.
*  Last one.
*  Bengals Browns.
*  That is in Cleveland, assuming Deshaun yet again.
*  I Bengals by three.
*  Oh wow.
*  I'm going to win this week.
*  I had five.
*  It's four and a half.
*  Ridiculous.
*  Do you think Cleveland was looking ahead to this game?
*  No, you know what?
*  I fucked that up because we, we noticed this today with that Eagles line.
*  They're just adding two to three points to these teams because nobody
*  wants to bet on the Sean.
*  That was a bad item.
*  You're just, that was just read their point total for every game and it's
*  13, 14, 15, you know, should not be favored by four and a half on the road.
*  They suck.
*  Anybody.
*  They suck.
*  They do.
*  So this line should be two and a half and there's just two extra points because
*  they're basically daring you to bet on the Sean, but they 20 points suck.
*  Browns are the 14 point, you know?
*  Yeah.
*  It's right in there.
*  Poop Fecta Colts, dolphins, Indianapolis.
*  It, the dolphins just cannot be getting less than three and a half against
*  anybody that's even mediocre.
*  So I'm going to say Colts by three and a half.
*  You get this exactly.
*  It was four and a half, but went down to three and a half.
*  I said two, so you got not dead yet.
*  Nope.
*  Washington's home for the Panthers.
*  That's gotta be at least seven.
*  So I'm just going to say Washington by seven.
*  Shit.
*  Here comes the, here's the comeback.
*  I said six and a half.
*  It's eight and a half.
*  Let me add these up.
*  That's a teaser.
*  Two, three, four, five, six.
*  Washington's defense.
*  I don't know if I trust them to hold the tease.
*  They gotta win that if they're for real.
*  True.
*  So what is it?
*  It's the Ron Rivera.
*  No, you got it.
*  I said seven.
*  It was eight and a half.
*  What's the, what are the records?
*  What do we have?
*  Oh, it's eight to six still made eight to six.
*  So Washington has Washington's four and two and they have Carolina this week,
*  Chicago next week at the Giants week nine.
*  This is, they've got to come out of this stretch six and three, ideally seven and
*  two, but six and three, I think.
*  Like then they'll be favored on some of those others.
*  This one for sure.
*  Okay.
*  Rams Raiders in Los Angeles.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  It doesn't matter.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you want to predict the line, but then the line versus fight
*  videos in the stands that start coming on Instagram that night?
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  Instagram that night.
*  You're right.
*  I'll do the line first.
*  I have the Rams by two and a half over the Raiders.
*  Okay.
*  Good.
*  I said three and a half.
*  It's four and a half.
*  Everyone's down on those cornerbacks that you hate.
*  That's stupid.
*  Is there cup and Nakua next week though?
*  Vegas zone.
*  I don't know.
*  I would think one of them might be healthy, right?
*  After they had the buy, right?
*  All right.
*  So four and a half.
*  So how many Instagram fights of people fighting in the stands during this game?
*  Probably the same, right?
*  Four and a half.
*  Oh, more.
*  That's gotta be more in the stands or could it be outside the stadium too?
*  Cause there's a bunch that's stands, concourse or parking lot.
*  Over.
*  Give me the over eight and a half.
*  Yeah.
*  And Fandl you should put this up.
*  Let's have some fun.
*  I don't know if Rossellos talked about this on this podcast, but on his podcast,
*  but this is a passion point of Rossellos with the, with these fight videos from the stands.
*  He says every single time the guy who's higher up wins the fight.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause he's got leverage of like a foot, right?
*  And you can come down and the other guy's looking up and it's just, you know, in
*  boxing, you might be able to pull that off, but when the stairs are like that, the
*  guy who's lower always loses.
*  Almost always.
*  There was one recently, I think it was a hockey fight and somebody pointed out,
*  like what kind of loser do you have to be to, to you drop the fight to a 14 year
*  old and while you were on higher ground, but yeah, once you saw that one, yeah,
*  you got to grab the shirt just right.
*  I think for it to work.
*  Well, what do you do if you're lower?
*  That's what I mean.
*  I think you gotta, you gotta, you gotta grab the shirt and then uppercut.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You gotta get them in there.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like, do you go right?
*  Do you punch right in the balls?
*  Cause that's like you have direct shot for the straight, right?
*  Yeah.
*  You have the wife or girlfriend distract and then, uh, and then you start biting his
*  ear.
*  That's the only way to do it.
*  There's the other one is when the person comes from the side, same row and sometimes
*  misses and then falls right.
*  And then can get tagged from behind and then it might hit his head with the chair.
*  I would watch like an hour long breakdown of do's and don'ts for this.
*  I would love it too.
*  And I'll go even further.
*  I would like wind probabilities attached during these fights to see who the hell
*  I'm rooting for, who I should be rooting for.
*  Listen, when I see the person lower versus the person higher, it's already 20% wind
*  probability.
*  If you're lower, it's gotta be, it's gotta be, we took some shit for that, but I do
*  want to make one clarification.
*  Well, people are like, oh yeah, but you guys are all for, you're okay.
*  If they put live lines on there.
*  I was like, yeah, cause that's a real thing.
*  That's something that's a tool that you could use and make money or lose my
*  money or something.
*  One probability does, does nothing for you.
*  I'm really trying to like the WNBA and, and, you know, appreciate the place that's
*  in the links that have wind probability after they won game one.
*  And I was outraged.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like, Whoa, we were, we're down and then 99%.
*  And then we, and it was like, Oh, you mean when you hit a four pointer down three
*  to take a lead with five seconds left, your wind probability was pretty low.
*  It's unlikely.
*  Yeah.
*  It was unlikely you're going to win at that point as people were leaving.
*  Cause they thought the Liberty had already won.
*  I needed a stat for this.
*  You know, you should have started a fight in the stands at the links Liberty game.
*  That would be great.
*  Only with people below.
*  I don't, I don't go backwards.
*  Yeah.
*  It's gotta be people.
*  That would have been tough cause you were courtside probably.
*  Right.
*  I think so.
*  I was that courtside.
*  Who am I?
*  Tommy alter?
*  Come on.
*  All right.
*  Sunday night jets at Pittsburgh.
*  I don't know who wins this game, but it's going to be ugly.
*  I don't think it's going to be very fun to watch.
*  And I feel like whatever side I picked, I'm going to lose the bet.
*  I might have to stay away.
*  It was like the giants game today.
*  I even though I had a million dollar picks in real life, I was like, I'm
*  staying away and I just know my feelings.
*  The Steelers are automatic.
*  Stay away.
*  You're just, you're just, you're not watching.
*  If you don't say it's a, it's a rat line.
*  I'm going to say.
*  Oh man.
*  I'm going to say Steelers by one.
*  That's what I said.
*  It's one and a half.
*  So you beat me.
*  We could be done.
*  Um, we could be done with the picks too.
*  Yeah.
*  But we could be done, um, with the, these two teams and the night games.
*  Right.
*  I feel like, I think the jets have like three more.
*  I don't need to see the jets every fricking night game.
*  Do you want to hear about Jeff Albrecht?
*  How, how beloved is he?
*  Jeff Albrecht, how, how beloved he is in the locker room.
*  This guy, he knows he has handshakes with Mike.
*  He's got handshakes with all 53 guys.
*  I don't know how he remembers so many handshakes, Mike.
*  Let's go to our next gen stats, Mike, and see how many handshakes, uh, Jeff
*  Albrecht has he's number two in PFF for handshakes with the players.
*  Collins Earth had a good one today talking about Daniel Jones.
*  I was thinking of you.
*  Well, it wasn't at the best time.
*  He tours ACL.
*  Like, do you know how hard it is to rehab, Mike?
*  Do you know how hard it is to rehab and come back?
*  You know how hard that is.
*  And he's out there running around.
*  Did he let Mike answer?
*  Does Mikey at least get to answer how hard it is?
*  I think Mike just nods.
*  He just wants to get the next play.
*  What's the win probability for Daniel Jones in a night game?
*  When he's rehabbing.
*  Yeah.
*  We have two Monday night games this week for reasons that remain unclear.
*  Why are they doing that?
*  This is there.
*  There's no way there's not a million things going on.
*  You know what it is?
*  It might be to shut people like you and I up because well, here's another thing.
*  I don't realize why they do.
*  I don't understand.
*  There's only two buys the bears and the Cowboys.
*  So when there's four buys that knocks out a game for the 1pm kickoff.
*  Maybe they're moving one of those.
*  I mean, he certainly looked like one, you know, one of them looks like.
*  I don't know.
*  Ravens at Tampa is one of them.
*  And that's a really good game.
*  That's a good one.
*  And I think the Ravens are favored by minus two and a half.
*  You're going to get that.
*  I said two and it's four and a half.
*  Wait, let me make sure you're not striking distance here.
*  Four, five, six, seven, eight, one, two, three, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
*  Now I have 10.
*  You have eight.
*  Congratulations.
*  Did it.
*  You're going to win this next one.
*  Cardinals Chargers.
*  Cardinals home, right?
*  Yep.
*  I have Cardinals by two.
*  Yeah.
*  I had Cardinals by one and it's Chargers by one and a half.
*  No, it's a little strange.
*  I think the Chargers defense is good.
*  Like legit good.
*  Yeah.
*  So there's that maybe, maybe Vegas.
*  Yeah.
*  Both supplies.
*  It's nice.
*  It's kind of nice when they have pressure.
*  So next week for the multi view on YouTube TV.
*  On YouTube TV.
*  Oh yeah.
*  You got to pick this.
*  Well, I have to pick it, but it's the hardest week because seven lines Vikings
*  in the early games, lions, Vikings, Seahawks, Falcons, Eagles, giants, Texans,
*  Packers, Titans, Bills.
*  Those are five really good games.
*  Plus I'll be in a hangover after Drake may as his first win in London against
*  Middle.
*  See Middle.
*  See Middle.
*  See Doug.
*  His last game before he's on that one to see you in his office.
*  Now he's going to say goodbye.
*  I you can call him and Gerald McCoy two weeks.
*  I'm here.
*  Middle seat.
*  Doug has joined us.
*  Middle seat.
*  But you want to know, do you want to club soda and what mixed nuts or roasted nuts?
*  Okay.
*  It'll see.
*  Would you like a still cheese plate?
*  You don't have to, I don't think Tennessee Buffalo needs to be in there.
*  I think that's a game for 40 minutes.
*  Listen, I think you're underestimating Will Levis.
*  It's pretty fun twice a game when you, when you're looking at the Will Levis
*  TV and his hands are on his helmet and the other team celebrating.
*  So they cut to coach Callahan.
*  Who's just like, I don't know what we do.
*  How fast can we trade for the Sean Watson?
*  That was guest Alliance.
