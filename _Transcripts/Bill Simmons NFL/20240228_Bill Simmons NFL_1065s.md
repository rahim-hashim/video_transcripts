# Should the Patriots Take a QB at No. 3? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [February 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0QDGMFyPT8)
*  There's something I wanted to ask you about.
*  Okay.
*  Do you think the Patriots should take a quarterback at three?
*  Because you're a guy who does not watch a lot of college football, so I'm wondering what
*  you think about them drafting third and who they should take.
*  Because I have a take on this, but I want to hear yours.
*  First of all, I really appreciate you thinking about me and asking where I stand on this,
*  because it's been dominating.
*  The only two things I care about are the Celtic season and what the Patriots are going to
*  do with three.
*  Well, I have the spirit.
*  Have you talked about this on like six other podcasts?
*  I have not.
*  I really haven't talked because I've really gotten into it since the Super Bowl.
*  And I've been trying to study the three guys and trying to figure out where I'm leaning
*  and what I like and reading all the features, trying to find out what they're like as teammates
*  and leaders and all that shit.
*  And first of all, they have to stay at three and take a quarterback because I just think
*  if you hit with a franchise quarterback, which is basically 45% odds, 40% odds with the way
*  it's gone.
*  But if you hit, you're set.
*  And they're in a conference with Borough and Mahomes and Herbert.
*  They have to get one.
*  So when I see stuff like, oh, trade back, get picked.
*  Or there was this dumb story today.
*  They're trade the pick with other stuff for Justin Jefferson.
*  Well, that's, we wouldn't have a quarterback to throw to him.
*  Trade back to the Raiders at eight, pick up more stuff.
*  Okay.
*  So now I'm keeping my fingers crossed with JJ McCarthy.
*  These three guys seem like really good bets to be good franchise quarterbacks.
*  And people that I talked to in college who love college football really like all of the
*  quarterbacks and they each kind of pick one.
*  So Caleb, it's like, eh, why was his last year so bad?
*  What's going on there?
*  Is he going to be like happy in the right situation?
*  And it seems like more off the field stuff with him.
*  With Drake May, it's like, ah, North Carolina, we've seen this before.
*  We've seen guys like this that they win you over with the highlights, but go watch the
*  film.
*  It's not as good as you think.
*  And then Daniels is just too skinny.
*  Daniels, they listed two 10.
*  I don't think there's any way he's two 10.
*  We're going to find out at the combine this week.
*  And he plays pretty recklessly for his size.
*  Well, so they, uh, they talked about this on the ringer NFL draft show.
*  Nate Tice described them as having some Johnny Knoxville in him, which I, which is a great
*  way to put it.
*  He takes huge hits.
*  And you know, I think like Lamar came into the league, he was six foot two, two 15.
*  This guy is six foot four.
*  He's probably like two Oh five.
*  So even if you put a little bulk on them, to me, my, my, and I, I'm not going to finalize
*  this yet, but it seems like if Drake may felt a three for them where it was supposed to
*  be hammer Caleb Williams a couple of months ago, Oh, who's going to get number one.
*  And now he falls to three and he has the chip on his shoulder and he's already six, four
*  to 30.
*  He can already make a ton of throws.
*  If you go back and you read all this stuff about him and Carolina, everybody's like,
*  this guy's fucking amazing.
*  I love this guy.
*  He's a leader.
*  He's changed the culture here.
*  Like he went there and changed the culture of their football program.
*  And it just seems like he seems like a safe safer bet than Daniel's who would be amazing,
*  who would be like an athlete in a QBA I've never rooted for before, but could just get
*  hurt immediately.
*  So I'm kind of leaning toward Drake may.
*  So what do you think?
*  Well, I got to say, I've been thinking about this and I disagree with you.
*  Okay, good.
*  Okay.
*  This is my thinking on this.
*  If you have the number one pick and Williams is there, you take him because he is a situation
*  where if he's not elite, he's a bust.
*  But that that sort of is like that.
*  His floor is a great NFL quarterback.
*  He seems to have the body, the skills.
*  It is like it seems to be like a package that's too good to pass up.
*  So you're saying his floor as he would be like the 10th best quarterback.
*  No, I don't know what his floor is, but he's the only like, okay, for you know, if Drake
*  may has a career like like Chad Pennington, or if he has a career like, oh, Kirk Cousins
*  or something.
*  Well, could he be Josh Allen?
*  No, no.
*  Well, well, what I'm just saying is that Drake may if he's just a starting quarterback and
*  he has some pretty good years, some average years, you know, it's like that's the same
*  successful career.
*  But I think he's a higher, higher ceiling than those guys.
*  Well, no, I know.
*  I know what I'm saying.
*  If that's what happens to him, if that's what his career ends up being, it's still okay.
*  It's like he you know, he was still a starting quarterback for many years on some probably
*  pretty good teams.
*  Could he be poor man's Josh Allen would be kind of the floor for him.
*  Because he's going to be 245 pounds.
*  You say the floor, the floor.
*  I don't.
*  The thing is, I don't I don't know.
*  I think for most of these guys, the floor actually is pretty low.
*  Yeah, the floor is bussed.
*  So my thinking is this.
*  Now this may have changed because things you know, if I'm picking three, if May, if he
*  falls to three, it's a tough thing.
*  But I would be I would almost be more interested in taking Marvin Harrison Jr. and drafting
*  Bo Nix if he's still there.
*  Like in the second round, they have the 35th pick.
*  Yeah.
*  And then drafting Sam Hartman late in the draft.
*  Or maybe even if he if he doesn't get big.
*  Because to me, Bo Nix and Sam Hartman, he was the guy from Wake Forest who went to Notre
*  Dame.
*  Yeah.
*  Those seem like the two guys who are in the best position to play immediately.
*  Like at like like I think Hartman looks like he's 26 or 27 or whatever.
*  He looks like he could play immediately.
*  Now, granted, it seems as though his ceiling would be being a good NFL backup.
*  But it seems as though these attempts to find these quarterbacks, it's it's it's too much
*  of just rolling the dice.
*  There's as much I mean, we can't just use Brock Purdy is the only example.
*  But it seems possible that if you get the right guy in the right situation, he can succeed.
*  But if you put the right guy in the wrong situation, it doesn't matter how right he
*  is.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  It's true.
*  It would almost seem to be better to build everything around it and hope.
*  I know it sounds kind of like a desperate thing, but kind of hope that somehow a quarterback
*  ends up there over time.
*  I mean, like, OK, maybe you maybe you take a look at a trade pick on Joe Milton.
*  OK, he was the guy from Tennessee.
*  He threw an orange 102 yards, an apple, an apple, a hundred.
*  He threw up. He threw some produce 102 yards.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, now that doesn't make him a great quarterback, but it means he kind of has the body and he
*  has the arm.
*  To me, if you have these guys, the main thing you want, you don't want to draft somebody
*  who can't make the throws.
*  You don't want to draft somebody who's not more.
*  Those are the two things.
*  You know, everything else seems to be very situational.
*  And I don't know if I have enough confidence in any guy like like even Williams.
*  He might not succeed, but it's like it's too good to pass up.
*  You got to do it.
*  But outside of that, I think the idea of the quarterback's the most important position.
*  So we just got to pick whatever is the best quarterback available.
*  I think that's bad thinking.
*  And I don't think it's working out for people.
*  I mean, like I young.
*  But do you think Bryce Young is bad or do you think it's the situation he's in?
*  Because I think it's impossible to tell.
*  Well, he had no weapons, but he also he also seemed really short.
*  Well, that's the thing.
*  And watching the games, it was like, man, he can't even throw over the middle at all.
*  He can't see these guys.
*  The question is, is he just a little too small to be great or is he just not quite good enough
*  to succeed at that size?
*  But I think the surprise to me was that I thought he would be more athletic because
*  I knew he was short.
*  Obviously, you read anything about it, but I thought he'd be able to maneuver around
*  and buy himself time.
*  And that's what he couldn't really do.
*  Like, that's what Kyla Murray does.
*  And some of these other, you know, the smaller quarterbacks can move around.
*  That's what Russ Wilson was able to do early on with with Seattle.
*  I just think these three guys might be better as a threesome than some of the other ones.
*  This goes back to the whole cluster theory, right?
*  When it's like, you know, it's like the Trey Lance draft or Zach Wilson and Trey Lance
*  and Mack Jones.
*  And you go back and you're like, oh, maybe those guys weren't that good.
*  Well, I mean, it's hard.
*  It's just OK.
*  We did a podcast years ago when there was the whole big class of quarterbacks coming
*  out.
*  And I remember.
*  Because you and I both liked it on the upside.
*  We both like Josh Allen.
*  Like you and she like stood behind you at a target.
*  No, I met him.
*  I met him at the Masters and he was six foot five and really charismatic.
*  And we were like, oh, this guy seems cool.
*  That was it.
*  I had no real real reason.
*  I thought you saw him in a target for some reason.
*  But anyway, we were right about that.
*  You know, but then I was also like, oh, Baker Mayfield, they should move him to slot receiver.
*  I remember.
*  I remember.
*  And then we were like, but we both also we like Lamar.
*  We thought he was great.
*  Then I also like I remember thinking like, well, maybe Josh Rosen will be the best of
*  all these guys who are there.
*  You know, it's like so like we're right and wrong.
*  OK, now, obviously, this isn't our job.
*  We're just guys talking.
*  Me particularly. I'm just a dude talking.
*  I know knowledge.
*  It's like but like so it's it seems like drafting a quarterback now or not, not even
*  drafting, developing a quarterback, having a quarterback who's successful.
*  It's it's true.
*  Not even too difficult.
*  It's kind of impossible to look at these guys in college and actually know who's going
*  to succeed. I mean, look at the Browns last year.
*  The Browns did pretty good just shuffling through quarterbacks that they built all around
*  him. Right. They had the running game, their defense, not like San Francisco has done
*  this right. That this idea that we need to start with the quarterback, I think that's
*  just a way to fuck these guys up, particularly with this idea with the way contracts are
*  set up now. And you have to succeed when your guy's on a rookie contract or whatever.
*  They need to change how that is structured because what they're really doing is just
*  damaging these guys.
*  You know, and it's like so well in some cases, because you could argue CJ Stroud, which
*  to me, CJ Stroud is is why this is so fucking hard, because everybody stared at that all
*  spring and it went back and forth.
*  And there was like there was some tests that he took that he got a low score on and people
*  got scared about that. And then it was like Ohio State is the system guy.
*  Is it? I remember every other guy from Ohio, every other guy from Ohio State underperformed.
*  Right. Every other quarterback.
*  So people are like, no way. Yeah.
*  Yeah. And then immediately you could tell.
*  I remember Sal and I were talking about it the first two weeks of the Sunday pods.
*  We were like, CJ Stroud is good.
*  Like, this is a wrap. This guy has it.
*  You can see it. And that's part of this where some it's weird that we don't know, we don't
*  know, we don't know. And then when they go out and they start playing.
*  You kind of immediately know.
*  But OK, because of this, I think because he succeeded in this way that was very unexpected,
*  it actually makes people like we want to draft a quarterback then we got to draft one of
*  these guys. You have to me.
*  To me, it's the opposite.
*  The fact that the guy who clearly was the best from that class did not seem that way
*  when he was coming out of college, that no one.
*  Now, I'm sure there's somebody out there who was like, I had a number one on my board.
*  But for the most part, that was not the case.
*  OK. Yeah. But go. But flip this the other way.
*  Just in the last six years, Mahomes, Josh Allen, CJ Stroud, Herbert,
*  Burrow, like we brought Purdy.
*  We've we've had real guys that can now lead teams that were in the draft.
*  So yeah, but but pretty was pretty was literally the last.
*  OK, Burrow makes sense.
*  OK, Lamar, I was twenty seven, twenty eight to the Ravens.
*  The Pats passed on him twice.
*  Yes. Or was it twenty?
*  Like anyways, you know, like they're they're actually sort of all.
*  Mars, another one.
*  Yes. They're kind of all over the board.
*  Right. So if not really, because we've had we've had seven in the last six years
*  that are now franchise guys.
*  I know. But look where they're.
*  But like we said, Purdy was the last guy drafted.
*  It was like, yeah, it wasn't.
*  It would be one thing if for the last year, the number one pick
*  every time succeeded, because that hasn't been the case.
*  Well, I mean, what's like Mahomes with the 14th pick?
*  Am I right about that?
*  Yeah, somewhere in there. OK.
*  Maybe somebody or somebody could somebody like put an old,
*  you know, I see an old tweet or whatever.
*  It was like when he got drafted
*  Nick Reich, that guy who basically talks about Mahomes,
*  you know, like he's like his son or whatever, you know,
*  it's like he had a tweet that was like, I don't know about this.
*  We'll have to see if it works out. I hope it does.
*  It's like, yeah, there's like there's like no way you can look at this.
*  You can look at these drafts and be like, well,
*  picking a quarterback early is the right move.
*  It doesn't seem like that's true to me.
*  So it almost seems better to maybe draft multiple quarterbacks later.
*  I like that. Well, you can do that.
*  That could be a strategy.
*  You'd take like fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh round.
*  You're staying for quarterbacks.
*  I don't know if you want to use all those people,
*  but like you could get a guy if you take both, let's say, Bo Nix.
*  Now, some people think I heard somebody saying
*  they think he might actually go to Denver at 15, which is real early.
*  But like, let's say he goes at the front of the second round,
*  you know, kind of like the way like Dupree's did or whatever.
*  So you you take him in the second round,
*  you take Hartman late,
*  maybe you take one other guy in there and kind of in the mid range.
*  You have three guys in camp and you can sort of maybe see, well,
*  do any of these have the potential to play now or be great later?
*  Where, you know? Yeah. But here's the thing.
*  Because what? But everyone operates out of fear.
*  So Drake may goes three.
*  The Patriots don't take him.
*  And then Drake may is awesome.
*  You're getting fired.
*  Well, sure. But if he if Drake may go to the Patriots,
*  what is the best he could be?
*  You think he could with what they have on the field?
*  Well, they're going to have a really good.
*  They're going to have a really good defense next year.
*  Try to get him some receivers.
*  Maybe he doesn't start in the first year.
*  I don't I actually think it's a pretty good situation.
*  I mean, OK, so like the thing about Caleb Williams is he does look like somebody
*  who could take a bad team and make them average,
*  an average team and make them good.
*  He seems as though that if he fulfills this potential,
*  he actually could be somewhat transformative in like the way Joe Burrow was.
*  On and off the field, too.
*  I I don't know if I feel confident about any of these other guys.
*  And there's a lot of them.
*  I mean, there was a time at the beginning of this year.
*  I was listening to Gary Danielson on the radio.
*  Gary Danielson said, like, there are 15 quarterbacks
*  in college football right now who, if they play to the apex of their potential,
*  will be top five picks.
*  Like he's like, it won't happen, of course.
*  All 15 can't do that.
*  But there are 15 guys who, if they play as well as their biggest supporter
*  believes they could do, they will be a top five pick.
*  They're just a lot more quarterbacks now.
*  I mean, like this, you know, it's odd because at the NFL level,
*  we seem like we're always missing.
*  We don't know. Don't have enough.
*  But at the college level, there seems to be a lot of good ones.
*  These seven on seven camps and all this stuff has really changed. Right.
*  So I said a basketball.
*  So I am not I'm not confident.
*  So you feel like more QBs are coming.
*  I feel like that the difference between the very best quarterback
*  and the 11th best quarterback in college football has really microscoped.
*  And it is more the situation you put them in.
*  So I I just I wouldn't feel confident being like, well, I'm going to use
*  this draft capital on a quarterback who's just kind of at the top of the draft,
*  who doesn't seem necessarily much more secure
*  than a quarterback who might be the seventh guy picked.
*  I mean, some quarterback pick.
*  Well, you know what?
*  So there's two things with this draft being in the spot, the Pats are in.
*  First of all, as a fan, if they got Daniels or May, I would immediately
*  like if they got Daniels, I'd be so excited.
*  I'd be so fearful of his injury potential, but he would be the most exciting patriot.
*  I don't even probably since like Randy Moss, we've never had anybody
*  who does some of the stuff he does.
*  I'd be nervous all the time.
*  But but anyway, Arizona is at four and they're all in on Kyla Murray.
*  Like they just did the tweet yesterday.
*  Carla Murray, our quarterback.
*  So, you know, they're taking Marvin Harrison at four and it would seem like
*  the move for the Patriots would be to pretend they're taking Marvin Harrison at three.
*  And then try to flip with the cards and get a little something.
*  And now you're at four.
*  And now if you decide to do the close term and plan now, you're at four.
*  I got an asset from Arizona.
*  I still am going to get the last of the quarterbacks at four.
*  Do I want to now move back to eight and.
*  And pick up more stuff from the Raiders, the Raiders hop up to four to get Jay
*  Daniels. Now I've got their second and their first next year, and then I'm at eight.
*  And then maybe I take the best receiver there and I take Bo Nicks like they're
*  I've talked about all these scenarios with all my Pats fans friends, but just
*  fundamentally like I don't know how they pass on Mayor Daniels.
*  I just they probably are hard for me to wrap my head around that.
*  I'm just saying I would.
