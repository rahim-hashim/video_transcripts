# Joe Burrow vs. Justin Herbert: Who Is the Better QB? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [December 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWVFzrC-d0Q)
*  So like where do you stand on this Borough Herbert thing?
*  I've been in the Herber over Borough since I think like Herbert started to take over the league.
*  This however is the best Borough has played better than any any stretch he had during the Super Bowl season.
*  The book on Borough last year was if you give the guy single high he'll rip you to shreds.
*  I mean Jamar and T Higgins are too good.
*  He's got too much trust, too much accuracy, too much quick process and that if he gets a
*  one-on-one matchup man or zone on the outside good night take your ball home.
*  You cannot do it against the Bengals. You gave them two high
*  they would struggle a little bit throwing the football still good
*  but they would struggle and one of the roots of that struggle was that Borough still tried to throw his one-on-one matchups.
*  He still tried to throw outside against two high tough thing to do and the second thing is if he didn't like the luck
*  he'd hold on to the football and he tried to create and that's where the lack of
*  elite physical tools came in. He wasn't the best mover. He's not the best arm.
*  He's a good mover in the decent arm but he's not the best and because of that he took a lot of sacks.
*  The offensive line was bad, early pressure, but he took a lot of sacks.
*  One of the things that Bengals fans hoped and expected entering this season was that an improved offensive line would bring Borough's sack rate down.
*  But it didn't. Early in the season Borough's sack rate remained the same. In fact it was jumping up relative to the amount of pressure
*  he was receiving and that's because sacks like we like to say sacks are quarterback stat.
*  Sack percentage, the likelihood of taking a sack is generally predicted by how the quarterback chooses to play.
*  Think Russell Wilson. If you choose just hold on to the football and screw around back there, you're going to get sacked a lot.
*  You're going to make some throws, make some plays. You're going to get sacked a lot. Adam Harstad of
*  I think Dynasty Football it is writes about the three legged stool of quarterbacking which is throwaway percentage or yards per attempt,
*  interception percentage and sack percentage. One of the three is going to be big.
*  You're going to take a lot of sacks. You're going to take a lot of interceptions or you're going to throw the ball away a lot or you're going to have a low depth of target.
*  Everybody's play style kind of fits into those buckets and Borough's play style was a high sack quarterback. Over the last week, a month and a half,
*  Borough's not taking sacks. Ball's coming out quicker. He's checking down. He's scrambling a lot more than he was.
*  It is very rare to see a quarterback change his stripes to see play style change.
*  That's one of the things that's been tough with Russ is he's still playing like he did when he was 24.
*  He's not 24 year old legs anymore. The fact that Borough
*  has kind of had an awakening here and realized I can't take this many sacks and it's just boom.
*  Gotten them out of his game this quickly is extremely impressive, especially if it's sustainable.
*  So Borough's making up ground on Herbert because he's taking a huge wart out of his game. If that's sustainable,
*  that's a huge deal for Cincinnati. I would also say everything that Borough gets credit for being good at
*  reading defenses, being accurate, all of that.
*  Justin Herbert's better at all that stuff. He's more accurate. He's better at processing. He's quicker at processing. He doesn't get sacked.
*  He doesn't throw interceptions. He still pushes the ball downfield. Solak just talked about that three-legged stool idea.
*  I wrote about that last year with Herbert. I mentioned it. He's like the only quarterback that doesn't have like a bad
*  metric in one of those. He has a bad A-dot, but that's not his fault. He does this year, but that's not his fault. Last year
*  he did not when he had an offensive line and weapons, but this is why we talk about him so much.
*  And it's not just us. I went to Chargers training camp. I interviewed their coaches. They talk about him
*  like we talk about him. Their quarterback coach, Shane Day, called him the greatest quarterback ever
*  after his second year. He says he has a file of clips that show why Justin Herbert's the best
*  quarterback ever. Brandon Staley talks about him like he's a god. And you never hear NFL coaches talk about their
*  players like that because they don't want to raise expectations. But Chargers coaches can't help themselves.
*  And I don't blame them because when you turn on the film, every play is perfect. You saw it on Sunday night.
*  Those were not ideal conditions. He was getting pressured within a second and you wouldn't even notice it.
*  He was just sliding away from the pressure, finding his check down, keeping his eyes downfield, throwing downfield.
*  He plays quarterback better than I've ever seen a person play quarterback at this point in his career.
*  He's not a playmaker. That's what separates him from the Josh Allens and the Patrick Mahomes.
*  He needs to live a little. He needs to let loose a little. He has the talent to do that.
*  He doesn't do it. He's such a robot to a fault. But when it's not a bad play, when it's good to go through your
*  progressions, no one's better than him at it. Well, now he's got Mike Williams back. It's interesting.
*  Their schedule is favorable the rest of the way. On FanDol, they're 20 to 1 to win the AFC.
*  The way you were talking about him was like when I was in high school, John Elway, the first five,
*  six years of John Elway, where he was just so good. It was almost like basketball, watching a
*  basketball player just put their team on their back and he would just win these playoff games he
*  shouldn't and just clearly had the most talent. But I wonder, could Herbert, if he's as good as
*  his, you know, the smart football community has been touting, could it just be this random year
*  where he just has a run like a basketball player would? We got to get Herbert his Mike Shanahan.
*  Joe Lombardi ain't it. That's a big part of the issue is that because Lombardi has a
*  computer quarterback, like Stephen says, Herbert's just so incessantly correct all of the times,
*  making the right read, making the right decisions at the right time. Lombardi does not feel the
*  stress to improve his offense because Herbert makes it work. And that's just like, it's such
*  a trap for the Chargers if they let the offense continue to play this way.
