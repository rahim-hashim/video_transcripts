# Nine Reasons Why NFL Quarterback Prospects Fail | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [April 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HPSAXuocQQ)
*  All right.
*  So I've been saving this for you for two months.
*  I did some, did some real recon on this because my team has a top three pick and
*  I've been really thinking about quarterbacks and what works and what doesn't work.
*  And a lot of people have done work on this.
*  We're still a little updates his thing every year.
*  It's a 50 50.
*  It's probably even 45% now that you're going to hit on your top pick.
*  I used to feel like it was 50 50.
*  I actually feel like the odds are probably worse.
*  Look, situation is 80% of this where you could take somebody who may have been
*  really good and he's just in the wrong spot and one thing leads to another.
*  And you just watch a guy's confidence get shattered.
*  I'll never know if Mac Jones is going to be a good quarterback.
*  He's sloppy, the ball, he wasn't a good athlete, but there was a scenario with a
*  different team with better, with, with a real offensive coordinator, with a QB
*  coach, with a certain type of system where maybe he could have been Brock
*  Purdy and the Niners.
*  I don't know.
*  There's other guys that just aren't going to happen.
*  Um, so I'm, I'm leaving situation out of this.
*  I'm going to give you the nine reasons why I think a quarterback will fail.
*  Oh, is this, is this, if he has one of the nine, he's done.
*  He can survive it.
*  Okay.
*  Okay.
*  But when he fails, it's usually at least one of these things, maybe more, maybe
*  two, maybe three first one, not a leader unpopular, the Bo Kalhan theory who came
*  to his birthday party, nobody.
*  Uh, I feel like this kind of nailed Carson Wentz a little bit.
*  Yeah.
*  They lost, lost the room.
*  Like you saw that with the Eagles, right?
*  Kind of lost the room.
*  Yeah.
*  It happens.
*  It's a thing that happens.
*  Right.
*  And it's that plus I would try to match his also on your list, which is injury,
*  right?
*  He got hurt.
*  And so like that, that plus losing the room is just, you lose your juice.
*  You lose your momentum.
*  Yeah.
*  So there's one, there's some Caleb Williams stuff that I think a lot of people
*  have alluded to and talked about it.
*  Just like, Hey, the quarterback is supposed to be the coolest, most
*  charismatic guy in your team.
*  Can he be a leader?
*  Can he be the coolest guy?
*  Can he be the calming force?
*  Or is he just like a little bit enigmatic?
*  Can you be an enigmatic, awesome quarterback?
*  There's some dialogue about it.
*  Uh, next one.
*  Too sloppy.
*  Sloppiness I feel like is the number one thing we overlook with quarterbacks.
*  Like this was the same Donald thing, right?
*  You go back in college and look at Sam Donald, just super sloppy and not just
*  interceptions, but fumbles, not, you know, not being able to basically protect the
*  ball.
*  Donald had 27 college games.
*  He had 14 fumbles and 20 interceptions in the 27 college games.
*  And there was like a lot of people were writing about this one.
*  It happened.
*  Um, and it, there was some stats from 2007 and 2017 QBs with eight fumbles or
*  more in their final college season.
*  The list was RG three, Jamarcus Russell, Curtis Ponder, Jake locker,
*  Blake Bortles and Blaine Gabbard.
*  Right.
*  It's like, well, that's not a good list.
*  I don't want to be on that list.
*  That's your final year.
*  You had eight fumbles.
*  Well, Caleb had eight fumbles last year.
*  They'd like 33 over three years.
*  That makes me like a whiff nervous.
*  Um, the interception rate, it's a little tougher to figure out because sometimes
*  guys are in offenses where it's like, Hey man, just take chances.
*  Yeah.
*  Huck it downfield.
*  But I think the combo of those, would you agree?
*  Like if you're sloppy in college, you're probably going to be sloppy as a pro
*  because these guys are faster.
*  They're coming at you all.
*  The coaches are better.
*  Sloppiness.
*  I feel like carries.
*  Absolutely.
*  Yeah.
*  My line is always quarterbacks don't change their stripes.
*  So your play style is your play style.
*  You can get a lot better or a lot worse within your play style.
*  Like a lot of different play styles can be elite and a lot of
*  different play styles can be really bad, but you are what you are.
*  If you're a high turnover player, you're probably going to say a high turnover
*  player.
*  If you're a high sack player, probably gonna say a high sack player.
*  You're a high throw away player, check down player.
*  You're probably going to say a high throw away, check down player.
*  Tiger doesn't change the stripes.
*  Next one.
*  You're just too short.
*  Yes.
*  Agreed.
*  And we can, we can fake this in a bunch of ways, but when you're too short, you're
*  too short and you have to be fucking fast or you have to have just incredible
*  poise the way rusted.
*  Yeah.
*  As Russ was probably too short, but Russ for years was a magician with the way he
*  was able to move around the pocket and buy himself time.
*  So you can also buy time.
*  Yeah.
*  And the deep ball made it worth it too.
*  Right.
*  Cause when you're short, oftentimes you're losing the intermediate area of the
*  field becomes really hard to throw to.
*  So you lose some of those explosives that are created in the intermediate
*  level of the field.
*  Russ could pay you back on that with really, really good deep accuracy.
*  And even like early Breeze, people always forget with Breeze early Breeze, young
*  Breeze was hocking that thing.
*  Like he was shooting down the field and then Breeze also had had preternatural
*  vision and sense and feel.
*  Right.
*  And that's where late stage Breeze, when he couldn't throw it down the field as
*  much was just like hitting windows.
*  The moment they opened crystalline, perfect clarity between two linemen, like
*  just like a gorgeous understanding of feel and space maestro level stuff.
*  Uh, and so that, right.
*  Like if you're going to be short, you better have some truly unique traits.
*  And that's where like your Baker struggles, your Bryce Young struggles, and
*  Kyler starts to become your, your pivot point starts to become your inflection
*  point.
*  It's like, okay, when he's healthy, Kyler's got it sometimes and he can get around it.
*  When Kyle is not healthy and he can't move as much.
*  Then you start to see the limits of the size.
*  It's a tough one.
*  Cause I still don't know where I stand on Bryce Young, but I know that he could not
*  throw the ball over the middle of the field.
*  And I don't know if that ever changed.
*  So now it's gotta be, you gotta be moving around and you got to be hitting deep
*  balls.
*  Otherwise you're not making it.
*  Next one, not athletic enough.
*  This is Mack Jones.
*  That Jones is just not athletic enough.
*  There's a world where you could have created a system that works, but ultimately
*  he just seemed like an inferior athlete in every football game.
*  He was in to the guys he was playing against.
*  And at some point defenses figured that out.
*  Yeah, that's, that's the one that Jared golf somehow survived.
*  Goff, golf and doors, golf, golf is the last great just statue drafted first
*  overall.
*  We'll never see another one.
*  It is the last of a dying breed.
*  If he just sits back there and hopes the pockets is cleaned up and he's, he's by
*  that, by this point he's, he's crossed the Rubicon.
*  Like he's good enough now that like he gets away with it early on.
*  It was like, okay, Sean McPay is helping him.
*  But golf is always the guy to me, right?
*  Athletically.
*  I watch him now and I go back and watch him at Cal and I'm like, how is this dude
*  possibly surviving the NFL?
*  But he's got to, that's the one he survived.
*  Yeah.
*  Blood so had the little of that too, where he was just six foot six and anytime he
*  was running limbs were just going everywhere.
*  And eventually it came and got him the goth thing, the little bit of the
*  situation with him, right?
*  Where he goes with McVay goes to McVay graduate school and then goes to this
*  lion situation where it's like, Hey man, anything you give us is a bonus.
*  And then they actually, he gets a good offensive coordinator that he gets
*  weapons, they build around him and everything is kind of additive positive.
*  And somehow it worked out, but I think there's nine other scenarios where he's
*  out of the league already, right?
*  Yeah.
*  And it's always with him and with, with cousins, the thing that always stands
*  out to me is they just, they started for long enough in these systems that
*  eventually they like got good, like experience is so helpful.
*  Once you start 70 and 75, 80 games, you just, you, you, you, you round out your
*  game, you know, your bread is butter, you know, you can get away with what you
*  can't and they can actually start giving you more like golf in the playoffs last
*  year was playing big boy grown up, one-on-one quarterbacking and doing it well.
*  Like that, that was, that was for real stuff.
*  And it's, and golf wasn't capable of that.
*  The last time he made a playoff run with the Rams and that's why they moved off
*  of them, but eventually experience accumulates and you start to really,
*  really sharpen and hone, you know, you're, you know, you're about so golf, like it
*  was fun to take the Mickey out of golf in the late 2010s, but now we kind of
*  got to give him his due a little bit.
*  Yeah, I agree.
*  Next one is too raw.
*  That's Trubisky and Lance just too raw.
*  Didn't play enough games at quarterback and came into the league and things were
*  too fast and no matter what their athletic traits were, is to them enough
*  experience, they were the guys playing the video game that you just jumped them
*  from the rookie to the all Madden level and they just couldn't handle it.
*  So is it starting experience for you?
*  That's kind of the solution.
*  Cause like people will talk about rawness as like a train.
*  I don't know if it's starting games in college or just like, just not enough
*  time playing the position or what it is.
*  Right.
*  Cause the name that immediately came to my mind was Anthony Richardson, right?
*  Who obviously only started the one season of Florida last year.
*  And we talked a lot about his rawness coming out, but for me, it was always
*  like, all right, he's, he's not raw.
*  He's just an experience.
*  Like you can see him like to me, raw is always like, they don't know how to process.
*  They don't know what they're supposed to be looking at.
*  They get back there deer in headlights.
*  They're, they're confused.
*  They're disoriented.
*  They haven't started to like ingrain the, the, the instincts, right?
*  That there's the subconscious decisions that a quarterback needs to make at
*  lightning speed Richardson was always for me, inexperienced, not raw.
*  He was always like, okay, I can see him making the choices.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just, he just, he just doesn't have enough time yet to like really
*  get the plane off the ground.
*  And I think, I think you saw in his, you know, four starts with the Colts.
*  How that inexperienced, but not raw, like he would make some mistakes, but you'd
*  also have some high caliber plays.
*  So there's, there's kind of raw is always a tough thing to categorize.
*  It's based on I'm getting that.
*  Where would you put Zach Wilson on that?
*  Yeah.
*  So Wilson, I would not, I would have described Wilson as raw.
*  What I would describe real soon as, as coddled.
*  And that's one that I'm kind of interested to see what you, but where
*  you come out with the rest of your numbers, I'm always very cautious of
*  quarterbacks who were playing at a lower level, we're playing with other NFLers.
*  And we're just kind of.
*  Playing on easy mode, right?
*  Just, just, just running the game on normal mode and, and then have to deal
*  with some of the challenges that you're going to exceed in the NFL thinking about
*  Zach Wilson as being one of those guys.
*  Thinking about Carson Wentz, having that a little bit as well at North Dakota state.
*  Just when these guys have, have really just really sweet environments in which
*  to develop to a little bit, but like obviously he's at Alabama, but still
*  like when they're just playing with like all these top 10 picks, all these top 20
*  picks, sometimes it becomes hard to see the cracks in the facade because they're
*  just protected, they're insulated by the guys around them.
*  Whereas Josh Allen, nobody believed in him had to go to Juco.
*  Still only got a couple of scholarships.
*  I've just got to win people over.
*  What else could I do?
*  Yeah.
*  Um, three more.
*  Um, Oh, four more, two, two erratic, two inaccurate, which is also Zach Wilson.
*  Just like fundamentally just can't consistently throw the ball to the guys on
*  his team and that's a skill that I don't, other than Josh Allen and maybe
*  one or two other examples over the last 25 years, usually doesn't get better
*  from college to the pros.
*  So it's Trey Lance too.
*  Fairland, accident Lynch.
*  Those guys just missed too many players.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like, Whoa, you're spraying around weak arm.
*  Josh Rosen.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just like, Hey, your arm's not strong enough.
*  Steve Walsh, uh, who predates you, you weren't even born yet, but Steve Walsh
*  was Dallas draft, I can't remember if Dallas drafted for him or traded for him,
*  but he was one of those guys was Steve Walsh winner game manager.
*  And then he just got to the pros and you could time his throws of the sundial,
*  but weak arm, I think killed Josh Rosen also who was also not athletic enough.
*  Yeah.
*  Kenny Pickett I put up there with a weak arm as well, or picket just doesn't
*  access enough of the field to scare me.
*  And he can bear, he throws a nine ball and it's, it's short every time.
*  And I'm just like, all right, like I can stop this guy.
*  Don't worry about it.
*  Two more, uh, two one dimensional.
*  I think this is the Justin Fields problem that a couple of teams exposed last year,
*  like the Browns and that one Justin Fields game where they were like, Oh, you
*  can only do this.
*  So we're going to make you do this instead.
*  And there was no plan B.
*  We'll see if he can shed that one.
*  You were a bigger Justin Fields fan than others, but to me it's like, Oh, he
*  succeeds in this one type of game, but can he succeed in multiple types of games?
*  I am not the thing is like, I agree with you and the one dimensionality makes it
*  impossible for the bears to keep him for a year overtaking Caleb Williams.
*  But whenever it came to, Hey, Sam Howell's going for a third.
*  Kenny Pickett's going for a fourth.
*  It was like, all right, like Justin Fields might be one dimensional, but that one
*  dimension is pretty good.
*  All right.
*  Four, four, two 40.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, we like that.
*  I got four, four, two 30 at quarterback.
*  Like we, that, that is a rare thing to have.
*  And so the thing about fields that interests me for the second stage of his
*  career as a QB two, as a spot QB one is just his dimension.
*  Like if Gardner mid shoes, one dimension is like, I'm accurate.
*  And Justin Fields, one dimension is like, I can outrun everyone on defense.
*  I'm a little more interested in the Justin Fields dimension.
*  Yeah.
*  Last one you mentioned coddled, uncultured, not a hard worker.
*  That's basically the Jamarcus Russell, the famous story about they gave him the
*  DVD with the plays and they put something in it and then whatever that story was,
*  or never thought, um, those are some guys too, where they're just like, they're,
*  they just don't want to put the time in.
*  So if we're going backwards and we're not counting wrong situation, we're not
*  counting injury, not a leader in popular, too sloppy, too short, not athletic enough,
*  too raw, too or erratic and accurate, weak arm, too, one dimensional,
*  unculturable slash coddled slash not a hard worker.
*  And then you look at all the guys we're staring at right now.
*  And we already talked about Caleb.
*  If I give you those nine things, what worries you with Jade and Daniel?
*  Dan, Jaden Daniels.
*  Yeah, I would say, um, one dimensional, right?
*  Because he is really like a one read and scramble guy.
*  Like he does not want to sit there, go through his reads and kind of get to a
*  check down.
*  Like I would say the dimensionality of it worries me.
*  The, uh, we didn't, we didn't really say like late breakout kind of talked about
*  a little bit being too coddled, but just to, he kind of had a Kenny Pickett
*  career arc where he started for four seasons, never really moved the needle as
*  an NFL guy.
*  And then all of a sudden his fifth season when he was older and the environment
*  around him had two top 10, top 20 picks, I should say a wide receiver, his left
*  tackle might be the first dude off the board next year.
*  Like they said, NFL is across the, uh, across the field.
*  Uh, he all of a sudden looks really, really good.
*  And so environment and kind of the coddled nature that he got there, I think
*  that that red flags for me.
*  And then he's not too short.
*  He's a little bit slight.
*  And I think that that body armor,
*  he's allegedly weighed two 10, which to me means he's two Oh five.
*  He's at, yes, he is extremely slight.
*  It's funny when you go and you try to find athletic comps for him in
*  terms of his height, weight, right?
*  He's a, one of the best cops for him is as Tom Brady, cause he's like six, five
*  or he takes you to me.
*  He's like, he's like six, four, two Oh five, which was also Brady size of the
*  combine.
*  It's just very funny that Jayden and Brady cannot possibly be more different
*  in terms of how they play the position.
*  Uh, so yeah, it's like, I think those are your red flags for Daniels for may.
*  Just cause we haven't talked about him on this pod, like the age piece, I guess
*  that's another way a QB can fail at.
*  I didn't know how to figure out how to put that in, but to trying to compare
*  somebody like may who's 21 and Daniels, who's, you know, a year and a half older
*  who spent half a decade in college.
*  And as you mentioned in his fifth year ended up in the best possible situation.
*  I don't know how to evaluate that.
*  And a year ago, you wouldn't have put him in the top three.
*  Right.
*  And I said, you know, I was talking out the side of my mouth.
*  I said, Jared golf gets all this experience.
*  He's good now.
*  And you say, well, okay, well Ben, like Jayden Daniels got all this experience.
*  Like, isn't it true that he could improve and develop?
*  And the answer is yes.
*  Like the same is true of like Bo Nicks who absolutely got better at Oregon than
*  he was at Auburn over his five years.
*  Michael Panics at Washington got better than he did over his, his time in
*  college as well.
*  I want to draft the quarterback before he develops.
*  I don't want to draft the final product.
*  I don't want, okay, this is what Jayden Daniels final product is.
*  It's scrambling all over the place.
*  It's tucking and running.
*  It's not going through his reads.
*  It's not throwing the middle of the field.
*  Like I, I agree that he's gotten better and it's okay to get better over, over
*  time and get all these reps, all this opportunity.
*  But I don't, if this is closer to your ceiling than Drake may is or Jason
*  McCarthy is I'd rather go that direction because I believe in my coaching staff.
*  I believe in my ability to foster development in quarterbacks.
*  Of course I need to actually have that.
*  Right.
*  I need to have that present in my building and you know, some teams don't
*  have the wide receivers, the offensive line of the coaching staff necessary to
*  do so.
*  Well, and then you'd think like Drake may, all right, let's say he stays
*  another year in college and then in his fifth year goes to a team like LSU had.
*  Would he have been really good?
*  I'm going to say yes.
*  And this is also Justin Herbert theorem as well a little bit, because remember
*  Justin Herbert went back to school because he was a giant geek who cared about
*  getting his degree, right?
*  He was just, he was a bit, but for the league, it was like, oh no, he went back
*  to college as a senior and then he played better that year than he did as a junior.
*  In my opinion, like he, I liked him more come out of a senior than he did off
*  his junior year, but the league had already decided like, Oh, he's too old.
*  And why did he go back?
*  And like, he should have dominated and he didn't like win the Heisman.
*  So there's always like the narrative arcs can get convoluted at this thing.
*  I also liked that Drake may stayed at North Carolina when he easily could have
*  left because you knew the team wasn't going to be as good.
*  He could have just jumped to some other program, tried to win the Heisman, tried
*  some season position himself as number one pick.
*  And I don't even think he even considered it.
*  He's like, I'm North Carolina.
*  My dad went here.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, my brother went here.
*  This is where I'm staying.
*  And if we're not as good this year, so be it.
*  These are my guys.
*  And which I think matters.
*  Yeah.
*  And my number one takeaway from charting this year, where like I watched all the
*  games from the senior seasons was just how bad UNC supporting cast was.
*  Like I think people know the name test Walker, cause he, like he had his, his
*  dispute with the NCAA and he's certainly an NFL receiver.
*  He's a middle round guy.
*  And I think he might be the only NFLer on that team.
*  The tight end might be like a late round guy when the day comes beyond that.
*  I mean, like this offensive line was, was really for a college line, like
*  dramatically below average and they didn't have schematic solutions to help
*  them in protection, like may was thrown on the Superman Cape every Saturday.
*  And his OC had left from the year before, right?
*  Yes.
*  Phil Longo left.
*  I was replaced.
*  I can't remember the name of the new OC.
*  Um, but so they're right.
*  They had a, a, a massive switch overall.
*  They lost talent and right.
*  May's just like dying back there to beat George attack.
*  Like it was a, it was not a good situation for him.
*  Would you say for him too erratic and accurate would be the way that he fails?
*  Yes.
*  I think too erratic and inaccurate.
*  Like I think that I, a, a proxy for kind of too erratic, a little bit too sloppy.
*  I think as I, as maybe a better one for me, it's just because it's because
*  may is so aggressive, right?
*  May.
*  Well, you called him a big game hunter, which I loved.
*  He's always going to take the 50 yarder over the 20 yarder.
*  May may loves to just be like, what if I, what if I won the game on one play?
*  And he, he'll do that first quarter, eight minutes left, second and three.
*  And you're like, dude, there's a lot of game left.
*  Like you gotta chill out.
*  He, there's nothing may loves more than identifying a blitz and saying, okay,
*  well my hot reads over there, but really like if I wait for a second and the
*  post gets up, like he, he just loves opportunity.
*  If you're gonna let a little bit more space develop for him, he's going to try
*  to try to try to kill you for it.
*  And so he is very aggressive.
*  I think he's like, I don't think he's in the red with aggression where you're
*  just like, okay, this guy's reckless.
*  Like he's never going to fix this.
*  Jamis Winston is going to have 30 touchdowns, 30 picks.
*  Like we're not going to be able to, to field an offense here.
*  I think he's more in the yellow where it's like, okay, like we can get away
*  with this, but we probably need to calibrate you back, but I think the
*  sloppiness is more the red flag than the, the erraticness because a lot of his.
*  Accuracy issues are a product of the fact that he's attempting 28 yard
*  throws into the sideline, into a tight window, right?
*  What's it okay?
*  Like, yes, this wasn't the most accurate pass, but also it's because like only
*  the most precise pass could have possibly been caught in this context.
*  If he was just throwing bone X check downs, the whole game, he'd look really accurate.
*  Well, he'll, he'll get used to that in the Patriots next year.
*  Receivers that are trying to squeeze things in just before we go, JJ McCarthy,
*  what would you say if you failed out of those nine things I gave you?
*  What would be the reason?
*  Oh, kind of like JJ.
*  Jesus.
*  I do.
*  I, I, I think if you were making me commit my franchise to a guy and I had to
*  pick between JJ and Jayden, honestly, like the closer we get, the more I feel
*  like I'm like, man, I think I would do JJ.
*  I think I would.
*  Um, I think McCarthy, I think the rawness is there.
*  Uh, I do think that, that you just have so little data.
*  You have a small sample size for what he was in college, especially like in
*  the context of like people say like, Oh, like if you look at his numbers on third
*  down, they were good and like, Oh, when he was trailing in fourth quarter, they
*  were good.
*  Yes, but he never entered a game under the conditions that Caleb and Drake
*  entered it where they were like, or even Jayden where it's like, Hey, like.
*  If I'm not the best player on the field for four quarters, we're going to lose.
*  Like McCarthy never had just the size of the, the weight on his back that these
*  other quarterbacks did even when they were against Ohio State key game, it's
*  still just like, Hey, like, I know the way our, our team works and I get to
*  defray some of the responsibility to other players.
*  Right.
*  And so it's just, I still think that that sensation is very real.
*  So to me, like the rawness is there for JJ.
*  Uh, I thought honestly, he was going to be a little bit more slight at talking
*  about the, the Jane Daniels issue.
*  He came into the combine quite heavy.
*  I don't know how real that number is.
*  So I have a little bit of size concerns, a little bit of arm talent concerns as
*  well, where I think that McCarthy has a fine arm, but if you watch him try to
*  throw outside of the numbers, you really see he has to put like both cheeks into
*  every single throw and there's big accuracy drains accordingly.
*  And so he really feels to me like a Brock Purdy type of player where it's just
*  like, Hey, like, you know, give him the super friends and he'll get the offense
*  off the ground, but like once you know, you kind of make him having to try to,
*  you know, carry extra off the load, like he's going to start making mistakes for
*  you.
*  He'll, he'll black out and throw it right at a linebacker.
*  Sometimes he won't be able to hit a guy open against the sideline.
*  Sometimes he's just a little bit limited.
*  So it's not a high ceiling guy, but I do, I do like a JG McCarthy.
*  And he's young.
*  I like that.
*  He's young.
*  Yep.
*  Um, I want the Patriots to draft Drake May.
*  He checks the most boxes for me.
*  I love the fact that he's going to be, he'll probably end up being 240, 245
*  pounds.
*  There's some Josh anytime somebody's being described as there's some Josh Allen
*  and some Justin Herbert there.
*  I'm in.
*  Yeah.
*  I like all the leadership stuff.
*  And I've said this before, but I love that he was like the little brother, just
*  getting the crap kicked out of him by the bigger brothers, all from good
*  athletes, tough kid, loyal.
*  Like there's just, I, I, I get it.
*  None of this is a sure thing, but to me, it's like, he's an 80, 20 bet that he
*  makes it.
*  Yeah.
*  My expectation is that if it goes one, Caleb, two, Jayden, my bet would be on
*  Drake.
*  Drake may be a third overall pick that that that's my expectation for how the
*  Patriots would behave in that context.
*  Or what are you rooting for if Drake is too?
*  I mean, I have to talk myself into Jayden Daniels or JJ McCarthy really quickly.
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  I guess the case for J for, for, uh, Jay Daniels is could he be the, one of the
*  best 10 players at his position?
*  Yes.
*  And it's like ceiling wise, he could, I don't know if JJ McCarthy will ever be
*  one of the 10 best players with JJ McCarthy.
*  It's more like, can he be Brock Purdy?
*  Yeah.
*  Is a different question.
*  I think may and Daniels, some people think may no way he could be a top 10
*  guy at his position.
*  I disagree.
*  Yeah.
*  I think may can be.
*  I also think Daniels can be Daniels is, is tricky because I I'm a huge
*  quarterback mobility guy.
*  I've been talking about it for years.
*  I was so, it's so great.
*  One of my big things is that quarterback mobility, when you have a guy who can
*  really run, he's not just high ceiling is also a high floor because the, the
*  running, the scrambling, it takes away sacks, right?
*  It takes away throwaways.
*  It gets you to second and six instead of second and 17 and second and 10.
*  Like that's the value.
*  But Daniels takes a lot of sacks and they, and he makes bad decisions under pressure.
*  He freaks out in clean pockets.
*  He doesn't give you the typical high floorness that a lot of these mobile
*  quarterbacks do may as a, as a counterpoint, like may is a good mover and may does a
*  lot to eliminate sacks and to get positive scrambles.
*  Like he gets, he has it the right way.
*  Jayden is so high.
*  Yeah.
*  Jayden is just so high variance with some of it.
*  And so Jayden is really truly like, I don't like to say this because I
*  think it gets used way too often.
*  Like I didn't say this of Anthony Richardson at the time.
*  And I didn't say this with Josh Allen at the time and I was wrong on Allen.
*  But like when people say, oh, he's high ceiling, low floor.
*  I oftentimes think that's like a, a too big of an oversimplification with Jayden,
*  man, he is really high ceiling.
*  He's really low floor.
*  There's no two ways around it.
*  He has a roll of the dice and hold your breath.
*  Well, I already have Chris have sports ingots in my life.
*  So to have my quarterback also be a hold your breath guy.
*  Some of those hits he took in a, in a, in the LSE was the, especially in that
*  Alabama game, just that one alone, three monster hits.
*  If they take Jayden at three, you got youtube.com you type in Jayden
*  Daniels versus Florida, 2023.
*  You watch that.
*  You don't watch anything else.
*  And that's the greatest player.
*  I've ever.
*  You're good.
*  You're fine.
*  Well, if they took whatever mayor Daniels at three, they get a receiver tackle at
*  35 and then they just throw darts to fill the other positions.
*  I think their defense is going to be good.
*  I'm actually kind of excited to see.
*  I agree.
