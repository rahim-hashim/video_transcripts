# Quarterback Tiers, and Why Patrick Mahomes is the Best | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [November 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQWdafw5w18)
*  I was thinking as my homes pulled out and unsurprising yet completely surprising
*  comeback, how this is the first time in his career.
*  He is indisputably, unquestionably the best quarterback in the world.
*  He's always been in the running.
*  I think the smart fans felt like he was the most talented, whatever Brady was in
*  there for a couple of years, Rogers, one, two MVPs this year, it felt like it was
*  him and Josh Allen and they were kind of like the Ali Frazier thing going a little
*  bit, but now it's my homes and he's by himself and it's like Hulk Hogan in the
*  mid eighties, 1985 Hogan just running through cities, pinning people left and
*  right, whatever feud he's in, he's going to win.
*  He's the guy.
*  I think it's official tonight.
*  He is the guy.
*  He is.
*  And until he like Hogan takes the stand and admits that he's doing anabolic
*  steroids, I think he is.
*  No, honestly, you're right.
*  And you're right.
*  No matter how you want to break it down.
*  He's the guy.
*  If you need one drive in the fourth quarter, if you need one play from the three,
*  if you need a division win, if you need a road win, as we saw, he hadn't lost in
*  October, November, the last 15 games or something that hasn't lost in the AFC
*  West ever on the road.
*  Was that right?
*  Like, I can't even believe some of these stats.
*  He, he could draw a pass an appearance call if you need it.
*  What do you need out of my homes?
*  You're going to get it.
*  And I don't know why we're kidding ourselves thinking it's anyone else.
*  Yeah, he certainly has the mantle now of the, I can't believe I bet against this
*  guy mantle, which has a long story in history, right?
*  There was years of Manning and Brady kind of both had it for a while.
*  Rogers had it for a little while, but now it's like, if you had the chargers
*  money line, you're probably celebrating.
*  What were the, what were the chiefs heading into that last drive down for
*  with like two minutes left?
*  What was the line?
*  Plus, plus one 72 was me and you and Henschen house.
*  And we're like, we always debate and you should just keep just bed at every time.
*  And you're going to come up plus.
*  Yeah.
*  I think we've said before, we always felt like he was the most talented
*  quarterback that we've seen, like just he, he brought the most tools and tricks
*  to the table of anybody, but I think what really needs to happen to be truly great.
*  He's got that super bowl already, but it's the week to week stuff.
*  It's nights like tonight where you just, those, you start stockpiling those and
*  you have five of those, then you have 10, and then that's been going on for a half
*  decade and now it's eight years.
*  Now it's nine years and that's what's going to happen.
*  And he also has, he was able to keep this going.
*  He loses Tiberio who is the best receiver in the league.
*  He still has the magic with Kelsey and it's one of those things where they were
*  just kind of keeping their fingers crossed, hoping that because they had my
*  homes that he would be the Steph Curry.
*  What we talked about an over underspot before the year.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's just put the pieces around him.
*  Well, they're eight and two, they have the best record in the AFC.
*  They have the second best record in the league and they have the
*  inside track in the one seed.
*  And you could say that the strategy, the gamble worked, right?
*  Even though Tyreek is crushing it on Miami, it's still kind of work.
*  It definitely worked.
*  But I think, and you mentioned Kelsey, but we should give them a little more
*  credit than just to mention, right?
*  Like he just, he just abused an all pro for almost four hours tonight.
*  Yeah, he went nuts.
*  And if you don't have that guy, maybe it's a little different.
*  If you don't have Hill and Kelsey, maybe we're not, uh, you know, singing songs
*  for Patrick Mahomes, but, um, it does work.
*  It all works.
*  And you know, he's, he's going to make this Darius Tony a star and whoever,
*  you know, who already got hurt.
*  Yeah, right.
*  He's already the game at half.
*  Yeah, that was it.
*  But I bet he doesn't freak out about that stuff, right?
*  Now it's really mattered to him and Pacheco is running the ball.
*  Like it doesn't really even matter who you put in there unless it's Kelsey is
*  out of there and not Mahomes.
*  Those that's the one guy.
*  Like Brady always had Gronk and I was thinking like, uh, you know, Brady and
*  Gronk, Mahomes and Kelsey, and I think Elway and Shannon Sharp are probably that
*  the QB tight end, it's probably that order one, two, three rivers and gates is
*  in there think Breeze and Jimmy Graham have a surprising amount of TDs.
*  I think they're like the third most QB tight end things ever.
*  And then your guy Witten with, uh, with Romo, I think is up there.
*  There's been some combos, but I think those three levitate above everybody else.
*  And especially Brady Gronk and Mahomes, Kelsey before the season, I wrote down
*  tiers of quarterbacks and I had Mahomes and Rogers in the top tier.
*  So did you write about your tiers concerning your quarterback, the
*  tears you and your dad shed every Sunday?
*  It's my, my actual tears as I watched Mac Jones roll out into another sack yet
*  again on third down, the next year I had was Brady Allen, Herbert Burrow.
*  That still feels pretty solid.
*  Brady might be down a level.
*  Then the next year, Russell Wilson, Matthew Stafford, who's basically broken.
*  Like this is it now we, you're calling Amazon and asking like, Hey man, can I,
*  can I return Matthew Stafford?
*  No, it's been more than a year.
*  Lamar Jackson, Derek Carr to Sean Watson.
*  I had in the next tier, you, I mean, I don't know what to do with Watson, but
*  you would definitely move Wilson, Stafford and Carr out of there.
*  Lamar stays the tier after that.
*  This is what I did before the season.
*  Prescott Murray, Mack, Tannehill cousins, Mack free falls out of there.
*  I think Murray's out of there too.
*  And then I had a Matt Ryan, GBG.
*  That's a funny tier.
*  Then I had their own tier.
*  Those two.
*  Yeah.
*  Then I had Lawrence Goff to a Hertz and two in Hertz like vault up.
*  Right.
*  Oh yeah.
*  They go up three, I think.
*  Two, sorry.
*  Yeah.
*  I redid it.
*  I had my homes own tier, Alan Herbert, Burrow Lamar, and then Brady
*  Hertz to a Watson in some order.
*  And then your guys probably right there with Gino and cousins and Aaron Rogers.
*  Can you imagine that?
*  But the fact that all of them is Aaron Rogers.
*  I mean, his, that Thursday night game was alarming.
*  Really?
*  Like that was like, Whoa, I think this is like 2010.
*  And Brett Favre territory we're moving into.
*  But my point is there's been a lot of quarterback upheaval, but the one thing
*  that has not changed was I had Russell, I had a, I had Zach Wilson as second to
*  last, and right now I still have him second to last.
*  I think we have to rank the Wilsons.
*  I think at every week at flip flops between Russ and Zach.
*  I mean, this is the most outstanding.
*  So I know we have other more important games to talk about, but Denver, if they
*  had scored 18 points, just 18 points by the end of regulation, they would be nine
*  and one now.
*  That's crazy.
*  18 points.
*  And they hired like the offense of Savant allegedly.
*  Yeah.
*  Hackett.
*  He knows his offenses.
*  Nathaniel.
*  Yeah.
*  Battle of the annuals.
*  Yeah.
*  That's amazing to me.
