# Are the 49ers the Most Complete Team in the NFL? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [November 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4uIuUdmx-Y)
*  There's some Niners buzz that now that we are rounding into the end of November,
*  this has been the team all along.
*  This is the one, this is the most complete team.
*  You have Philly, your Eagles declining a tiny bit.
*  Dallas, they look great last week, but now they're going to this Giants game.
*  There's illnesses and injuries on both sides everywhere.
*  The Chiefs, Mahomes, you know, um, still Mahomes, but they're eking these games out.
*  They're not exactly dominant.
*  Dominate.
*  Whereas it feels like the Niners eight plus game is better than anyone's eight
*  plus game, at least through the first 11 weeks.
*  We're from a ceiling standpoint, who do you think is the best team?
*  NFC exclusive.
*  You can go either conference ceiling standpoint, Chiefs of the best team.
*  That, that, that, that Chargers game was a good reminder that there's the elite
*  quarterbacks and then there's Patrick Mahomes.
*  It's not Patrick Mahomes among the elite quarterbacks, the elites.
*  And then one more step up and you go and you get Patrick and the certainty that
*  you get with him late in the game.
*  So I think that that ceiling always will belong to the Chiefs.
*  Okay.
*  And yeah, in the NFC specifically, it's extremely tough.
*  I think we've seen the ceiling of this Eagles team, and it's a very,
*  very good Eagles team.
*  I think we're currently watching the ceiling of the Niners team.
*  And I think Dallas is still getting there, right?
*  Dallas is expecting Tyron Smith to come back this season and then be able to kick
*  their excellent left tackle rookie player, Tyler's, uh, Tyler Smith into guard.
*  And like that bringing another step up to this offensive line could pay off huge
*  dividends, maybe they haven't had all of their weapons healthy at the same time.
*  I think the highest ceiling belongs to the Cowboys because I, the, the, the
*  pass rush for both San Francisco and for Dallas is dominant at any time in any
*  game, Dallas is defensive line and San Francisco is defensive line when they're
*  fully healthy can decide like, Hey, you're just not moving the ball for four quarters.
*  These are the two lines in the league right now that I trust to just win for 60
*  minutes.
*  Dallas is a little bit better of a quarterback and I think a little bit better
*  of a passing attack, though it is worth noting for as much as we know about Jimmy
*  and what he is and what he isn't, what he can and he can't do.
*  He has done more like out of structure, creating on his own, getting out of the
*  pocket at 33 touchdown to George Kittle, man.
*  Like I was positive that was a pick.
*  I've seen this play too many times.
*  I know this is a pick and it wasn't.
*  So Jimmy has elevated a teeny bit.
*  He's better I think now than he was in that 2019 season, but ceiling wise, I
*  think I still in the NFC give the, give the ticket to Dallas.
*  All right.
*  So after those three, it drops off massively.
*  Like even if you go to Fandel Eagles plus two 22 in the NFC Niners plus three
*  40 and then the Cowboys plus four 60, then it drops Niners.
*  I would say that they know, make me nervous as the injury factor.
*  Just their best three skill position guys.
*  I don't trust that they're going to be there eight weeks from now.
*  None of them.
*  The hits that Debo takes McCaffrey's history, Kittle's history.
*  I just don't trust it.
*  And then you throw in the Trent Williams piece too, where it always
*  seems like he's got something going on.
*  So that's what makes me nervous about them.
*  Plus the Shanahan piece of how many times can you just look awesome for two and a
*  half quarters and then as we get through the fourth quarter, things start shifting.
*  Dallas, the power thing that they tapped into, which is so funny because how many,
*  how many podcasts topics at the ringer were about Tony powered on the
*  fantasy show?
*  Oh my God.
*  Just wondering when the day would come and he's just as dominant can be out
*  there all the time running back.
*  And then you throw in Smith coming back at left tackle Prescott look pretty good
*  last week.
*  I think he's probably like a slightly better version of Jimmy G at this point,
*  unless there's some level that I don't see, but, um, there's some upside with
*  them and then your team feels a little bit like the rabbit team this year.
*  Why won't they be the rabbit team?
*  The, Oh God, they were so good those first eight weeks.
*  What happened?
*  I'm not going to say it's that bad, but what would give you encouragement that
*  they actually have a level to go up from here?
*  The offensive coaching staff changing and bringing some counters to the table.
*  When you watch that Colts film, the most concerning thing, offense or defense,
*  you know, like, uh, Dallas got us injured.
*  How are they going to replace him?
*  Jordan Davis, you know, whatever they got some, you know, big runs, yada, yada.
*  Most concerning thing is that the Colts secondary knew what was coming, right?
*  The Eagles passing game menu is very simple.
*  They, they get a lot of window dressing and they get motion and they get play
*  action and they run different screens to different players and what have you.
*  But they run as few concepts in the passing game as any team in the league does.
*  It's not an indictment on Jaylen Hertz.
*  It's partially because of who hurts is as a passer.
*  It's also just, that's all their passing offenses needed.
*  You just play the hits.
*  Why not?
*  You can run a very simple offense and it works because you're so
*  variable in the running game.
*  Well, I get against these Colts where you can't run the football as easily
*  against Grover Stewart, DeForest Buckner, this great interior, the Colts have.
*  The Eagles are running flood RPO to the flat and they're running their all, you
*  know, sticks run to the six and turn around.
*  They're all curls concept.
*  And like Indy's corners are just sitting and waiting.
*  Hey, they, why we've seen the film now.
*  So this offensive coaching staff and they've started to change a little bit, right?
*  They involved a lot more quarterback run, true quarterback run this game against
*  the Colts and they hadn't season in games previous.
*  They're are responsible for changing some stuff on this offense.
*  It, we, this offense is most analogous to like that 2018, 2019 Ravens offense,
*  that 2020 Cardinals offense, right?
*  We're like that you're running the ball out of shotgun, you're running read option.
*  You have all these RPOs.
*  And if you look at those offenses early in the seasons, they were unstoppable.
*  And then you started to get to November and into December, some good defensive
*  coordinator figured out something.
*  All right, this works.
*  The Colts were like, you know, blitz in the running back side and making sure
*  they had extra bodies for read option.
*  You know, DC started to figure out what the tendencies are.
*  And this starts to crumble.
*  This, these sorts of offenses tend to have a low half-life.
*  So it's very incumbent on Shane Stike and Nick Sirianni who don't have
*  backgrounds in this offense, right?
*  Who kind of like, you know, grafted in this quarterback run, the shotgun run
*  idea to now access more of their West coast backgrounds, find a way to make
*  this passing game more diverse such that corners can't cheat as much.
*  And then this office will hit its second stage.
*  So offensive coaching staff, investment development, and counters.
*  That's what you got to see.
*  The other thing they were doing was they just kind of hung around and let
*  Hertz give them five, six, seven seconds in the pocket, trying to decide what to do.
*  It was very frustrating to watch as somebody who had the Eagles in a pretty big tease.
*  Like I was like, why can't he figure this out?
*  He's got seven, eight, nine seconds and he still can't find anybody.
*  Yeah.
*  Hertz likes to see it and then rip it.
*  Right.
*  It hurts very much.
*  I would like to see it be open, see the window and then throw it.
*  He's not, he doesn't like to throw with anticipation.
*  Sometimes he's like great anticipation throws and you're like, all right, do that
*  all the time, man, and he just doesn't like to one of the things that Colts did
*  very well is they knew in their rush plan, like how are you going to get after
*  the quarterback?
*  This guy will create pressure for you.
*  Like Hertz in the pocket, like you'll go first read, second read.
*  Once it's not there, he'll start to move head down, eyes down, relocate, get
*  outside of the pocket.
*  He's a scrambler.
*  It's what he likes to do.
*  So they didn't say, you know, get after him, you know, put pressure on the
*  quarterback, push the pocket.
*  They kept them in front of them.
*  They were exactly rushed to disorient, rushed to make them uncomfortable and
*  then let him break, let him go.
*  They ran a lot of a cover one man with a spy and that works well when you're
*  positive, you can play cover one, which a lot of teams can't play cover one
*  against the Eagles, AJ Brown, Devontae Smith, Dallas Goddard when he was healthy.
*  It's hard to play cover one against the Eagles, but those corners knew what was
*  coming and they're just kind of sitting on routes and they're expecting the deep
*  comebacks and they're expecting the three level flood and everything the Eagles
*  run so well.
*  So if the Eagles get more variable in the passing game, you're not going to be as
*  bold playing straight cover one, you're going to lose that spy player.
*  And now that Jalen Hurte just let him stand back there and cause his own
*  problems, that strategy starts to fall apart a little bit.
