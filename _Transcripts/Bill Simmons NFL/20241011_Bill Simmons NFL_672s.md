# Five Best NFL Teams Right Now With Peter Schrager | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [October 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0)
*  Last question [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=0.0s)]
*  The five best teams in the league right now, whoo power ranking we know it's Casey is one they have to be yeah [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=2.48s)]
*  Even with fucking Jewish Meshuster who the the Pats wave done like August 9th. They're like funny [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=8.84s)]
*  This guy's watches on eight targets Casey has to be one. I [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=14.36s)]
*  Think Detroit has to be too fair because of how good their well [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=18.6s)]
*  We just saw the offense for the first time last week [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=21.86s)]
*  Like that's the offense we wanted to say the thing is they hadn't done anything the first four weeks [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Their last game was when they exploded and it was like, all right, that's the team [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=28.14s)]
*  But they were kind of showing us the I mean they ran like a hundred and fifty five plays no doubt in the two [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=30.8s)]
*  They just something wasn't trained and then finally they figured it out. Yeah, and then I always believed in the infrastructure [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=35.82s)]
*  So they have to be two [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=42.8s)]
*  Is Minnesota three [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=45.5s)]
*  Vikings fans are very sensitive because they're not getting their flowers [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=48.74s)]
*  they still think well they have they've had two games in a row where they built up a lead and then held on and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=51.96s)]
*  Darnold who I don't know if he got hurt in the first quarter, but he was genuinely bad for the last two hours [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=56.98s)]
*  I think he got hurt. Just him. Yeah. Yeah, even so like that [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=61.82s)]
*  And now you have they didn't bring it up [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=64.94s)]
*  You have thoughts of Sam Darnold in his previous stops and it's like hard for you as a mentally [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=66.3s)]
*  Capable fan watching football to be like, yep [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=72.28s)]
*  Sam Darnold is great again, like you've seen Sam Darnold do the dip [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=74.82s)]
*  So everyone's just kind of waiting and seeing they get the guys rolling around and being helped off and then comes back in and is sailing [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=79.02s)]
*  Passes my instinct is he might be hurt but did not come up there in the broadcast [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=86.1s)]
*  I have them three at a respect to the five [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=90.97999999999999s)]
*  I don't know defense and the fact that they built big leads and I think every game [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=94.46s)]
*  Yeah, they've been up double digits and every game they played. Yeah [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=99.53999999999999s)]
*  Baltimore I don't feel awesome about it [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=104.3s)]
*  But I think they have to be four even though I think you can throw on them and it's gonna be a real problem for them [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=106.74s)]
*  At some point the Baltimore we saw against [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=112.02s)]
*  Buffalo is the best team in all of football right now both sides of the ball [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=115.12s)]
*  Unfortunately, they haven't put that together in any of these games. Right the offense wasn't clicking [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=119.72s)]
*  So that game they played was probably the best game anyone played this 100% [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=126.84s)]
*  Yeah, I agree on primetime and it was unstoppable with Derek Henry from an 87 yard run to the start to the rest and then last [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=130.6s)]
*  Week the offense didn't stop but also in Zach or 32 year old defensive coordinator [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=136.04s)]
*  Those questions and now they're bringing in Dean Pease who's been with the Patriots and with their like a little help here because [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=141.32s)]
*  It can't be our Achilles heel. This is the Ravens. We can't be giving up that many yards on offense [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=146.76s)]
*  Well, my question is maybe if you have two good receivers, they're just not gonna be able to cover them [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=150.72s)]
*  So do you go and get Devante Adams? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=156.04s)]
*  If you're here if you're the Baltimore Ravens if you think you're good and your offense is gonna [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=159.28s)]
*  I think but your defense I would get I would get a D back [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=164.0s)]
*  I don't think they need a receiver because I that's the take it's like they they're playing great off that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=167.0s)]
*  Can I give a take? I don't know if I've given my Devante Adams take [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=171.88s)]
*  camera, let's go [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=175.95999999999998s)]
*  He's washed [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=177.72s)]
*  Take [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=180.6s)]
*  He's washed. I think he's also I don't think it open anymore. Where are the plays of him wide open? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=181.92s)]
*  He hasn't played he's got the hamstring injury [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=188.0s)]
*  But he wasn't they there was like two plays last year. We was open in the Netflix thing. It's like [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=189.72s)]
*  I'm so tired of this. They had this amazing win two weeks ago and everyone in the building is feeling good [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=194.36s)]
*  They're two and two he comes in on Monday and he sits down with Antonio Pearson [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=200.08s)]
*  It's like I want to be traded to a contender and it's like yeah, we're two and two [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=204.44s)]
*  So I think in his head maybe his agent said and all the media that covers it like there was gonna be a line 40 deep [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=209.84s)]
*  For his services. Well, then the reports were 24 to 48 hours into this week. He'll be traded to the Jets [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=215.76s)]
*  Well, that hasn't happened. We're now on Thursday. It's like a fourth round pick for him, right? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=221.67999999999998s)]
*  Cuz you gotta take the money. Well, I think they want a second round if you're gonna even get it [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=225.61999999999998s)]
*  There's no way no one's trading a second round pick for a 32 year old receiver [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=228.76s)]
*  You have to pay 13 million dollars the rest of the way. It's weird [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=231.67999999999998s)]
*  We don't think of football like in basketball. We're always using the history as a track record [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=235.32s)]
*  Yeah, and in football it's like once a receiver is about to hit their that 33 to 36 range. I'm out [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=239.67999999999998s)]
*  It's really like prove to me. You can still be good at that point [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=246.23999999999998s)]
*  It's like point cards in the NBA when they hit like 35 it's like I'm year to year with you from this point [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=249.72s)]
*  I don't we have no track record. No doubt you look at like [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=254.84s)]
*  Julio Jones is bouncing around the last four years of his career [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=257.92s)]
*  He's still one of the greatest ever. Julio Jones is a good example, but like I don't think Adams is at that point yet [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  I think he still has a couple years of great football and would be a top 10 wide receiver [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=265.0s)]
*  Great, top 10 wide receiver. At that number. No, yeah. I don't see that at all. He's been good [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=268.8s)]
*  I mean he had 113 yards or something against the Ravens. I always thought he was like [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=273.72s)]
*  He was never totally open but always just enough and could catch anything [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=277.3s)]
*  Well, the excuse was Jimmy G couldn't hit him and then Aiden O'Connell's on the guy [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=281.02000000000004s)]
*  So he still hasn't had that, you know opportunity with whoever the quarterback is [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=285.22s)]
*  No, but you comparing him to somebody like Nico Collins. That dude's fucking wide open four times [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=289.46000000000004s)]
*  No doubt. No doubt. Although now he's hurt. All right, so Baltimore four. I think they need to get a corner back [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=294.98s)]
*  I don't know. What's the trade deadline? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=300.34000000000003s)]
*  Week eight, week nine. Yeah a couple weeks. Yeah after Halloween. So for the fifth spot [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=302.61999999999995s)]
*  The nominees are I'll go, I'll scatter it around [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=308.73999999999995s)]
*  You could talk me into Washington. Yeah, you could talk me into Buffalo. I [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=314.5s)]
*  Wouldn't be happy about it. You could talk me into the two and three Niners [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=320.21999999999997s)]
*  Talk me into Green Bay or Houston. Okay, and I have a team that I have in the five spot [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=323.82s)]
*  But that that's how I would say Houston. So I have Houston is my number five complete all three facets [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=328.32s)]
*  They had one bad loss to a Viking team that came in and just it was red hot whatever [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  But when you say complete they can't block no, but they've be [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=339.76s)]
*  Mixing was hurt right and mixing so they can't acres is not gonna say they're not the Houston team that maybe they're gonna be in week [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=344.79999999999995s)]
*  11 and I was skeptical on the Texans this year [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=351.03999999999996s)]
*  I thought that they would take a step back at the book was out on them and a little bit of it was [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=353.47999999999996s)]
*  Alright, you bring in digs and Hunter and the whole deal. We're gonna do flips and they have proven me wrong. I think they're very good [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=358.28s)]
*  So I was not skeptical and I'm over I'm over committed on Texans futures Strouds been amazing [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=364.28s)]
*  He's unbelievable Stroud was so good last week and I don't I don't even think like they can't block [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=370.67999999999995s)]
*  Collins got hurt that with like two hours left in that game the other day [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=376.55999999999995s)]
*  But Stroud is over and over again been able to make a play when they need fourth quarter and he's like [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=380.34s)]
*  I think he doesn't even celebrate. He's been the best quarterback in the league. So this is a good debate [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=384.4s)]
*  I mean Daniels you could say but I want to see him against a really good as an avid listener [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=388.35999999999996s)]
*  No one loves doing MVP talk in October [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=392.64s)]
*  I'm just saying like quarterback Lamar has been unbelievable [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=397.28s)]
*  My homes have been very good. It's been really good. You're right Daniels and Stroud. Those are your four [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=401.2s)]
*  Daniels has been so good [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=408.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it's probably Lamar 1a Stroud 1b I just feel like Strouds doing more with less he's had no running game at all [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=410.24s)]
*  Yeah, I know he got what he didn't have Collins for the last two hours the last game and then digs stepped up last week [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=417.0s)]
*  He did catches 80 yards. Everyone's like what's a bit dangerous spot with the Pats this week [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=424.20000000000005s)]
*  and let down game [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=429.24s)]
*  It's there's seven point favorites. Yeah, right [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=430.88s)]
*  That's been the debt seven and up has been the death number for every favorite this year Drake May first game [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=433.76s)]
*  the Pats fans who were like [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=439.42s)]
*  Completely out on this team. Yeah now there's like Drake May buzz that be nothing to lose. Yeah, like if I tell Kyle [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=442.22s)]
*  You're not invited for Drake May's first game. I [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=450.26s)]
*  Honestly think that would be it. I don't know if we'd ever talk to me again [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=453.70000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, okay, but instead I'm gonna tell him Joe house is gonna be there and I'm making my mom cook Kyle [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=456.86s)]
*  You'll be back. Yeah, my mom's cooking for Drake May's first game [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=462.26s)]
*  How can you hear me? Did you just pass out? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=466.38s)]
*  Okay, great [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=469.82s)]
*  So we have Houston fifth, but I don't feel great about it. I think Green Bay [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=472.46000000000004s)]
*  I was at that game last week. That was a gritty win for them. What's a Rams Packers? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=475.82s)]
*  Yeah, I could see them stealing a spot at some point [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=480.46000000000004s)]
*  But at the same time, I don't know why that game was so hard to win [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=483.20000000000005s)]
*  It was a hard fought tough [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=486.0s)]
*  They threw the game away with the pick six and someone was like well actually a good play by love my I don't know [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=488.38s)]
*  That was a bad loss if they had lost that they found a way to win [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=492.78000000000003s)]
*  I think that's important like find a way to win [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=495.70000000000005s)]
*  That's good and the Rams might be done. They're one in four. I don't know that that that goose might be cooked [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=497.42s)]
*  They should be on five. That was a crazy win against San Francisco. That fake punt doesn't work. They're on five. Yeah [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=502.58000000000004s)]
*  Sometimes it's not your year, you know [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=509.2s)]
*  And you when you have a team built around two star receivers and neither of them play and I might not be your year [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=511.18s)]
*  I know you don't think there's oh you're every time you get aggregated every time you have a Rams opinion [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=516.38s)]
*  I think there's no Stafford Oh [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=521.8000000000001s)]
*  Trade possibilities, I don't know I buy week [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=525.26s)]
*  Let's see they come out of this thing. But what is the bye week right now this week? Oh, yeah, you're right [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=529.86s)]
*  Stafford and cup are two names that you keep coming up and seeing I [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=535.74s)]
*  Think McVeigh is committed to both of those guys for this season [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=539.82s)]
*  We'll see if the if the winds of change occur if there's more losses on the docket [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=545.1s)]
*  They want so like they won a Super Bowl they did it [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=550.54s)]
*  So when you win a Super Bowl, it did it makes all these decisions look at the cup thing because I said it on [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=554.78s)]
*  Somewhere I said, you know when the Chiefs were looking for zero Mike, you should call about cups [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=560.58s)]
*  I've ever thought I was like McVeigh's voice box saying someone asked about cup [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=563.78s)]
*  I'm just looking at the money that Cooper Cup is making the guy can still play and if there's so many teams that are wide [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=567.46s)]
*  receiver hungry whether it be the Kansas City Chiefs who are relying on Juju and Justin Watson right now or [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=573.3s)]
*  The Buffalo Bills who look at themselves as a Super Bowl contender but have Keon Coleman and you know Mac [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=579.58s)]
*  I can't come in I do too. It's like it falls apart when it's Mac Collins running 40 yards [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=585.54s)]
*  No doubt and it's like if you're Washington and like wait, we're better than we thought but it's Terry McLaurin and Dianne me Brown [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=590.86s)]
*  Cooper Cup fills a lot of holes. I was thinking about Washington for Cooper Cup. It'd be great. Yeah, so [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=596.26s)]
*  He's on the trade block by any means but like I'm just thinking as a you can't rule out Dallas as a wait [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=602.5s)]
*  What did that do? No doubt. Yeah, no doubt. You know, would you rather Devante Adams or Cooper Cup right now? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=607.7s)]
*  100% Cooper Cup [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=614.3000000000001s)]
*  It's not even close. Yeah [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=615.9000000000001s)]
*  If you're the Steelers and you wanted Brandon Iuke [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=617.9000000000001s)]
*  But you couldn't land Brandon Iuke at the end of the day like is Cooper Cup midseason for a second round pick [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=620.5s)]
*  Not a great offer. I'm glad you brought them up because that's the team that needs a receiver [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=625.7s)]
*  No doubt you watch that office pickings took last week off and [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=629.3000000000001s)]
*  By the way, I picked them every week a billion dollar picks not picking them this week because I was horrified by pickings [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=632.9s)]
*  And his locker room stuff is like well, that's the game plan. He's not like a thrilled guy. No, it is your number one [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=638.14s)]
*  Yeah, but as Craig Horlbeck said [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=644.78s)]
*  Tomlin just doesn't like nice things [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=648.8199999999999s)]
*  He he can't even feel until he's near 500 and that's gotta get back to the mean [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=651.5799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he's got to get back to the mean too many games above 500. Yeah [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=656.9s)]
*  You [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9oc4zdPBJ0&t=662.54s)]
