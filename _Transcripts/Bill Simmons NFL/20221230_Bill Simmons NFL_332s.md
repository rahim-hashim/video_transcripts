# Are Bill Belichick and the Patriots Done for the Season? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [December 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAG1XSwmz8)
*  The most fascinating game of the week is Dolphins Pats, where you have Teddy Bridgewater coming in
*  for the two, a concussion. This is third concussion of the year. It's amazing. Nobody even thought
*  that this was a reason why he tailed off so badly in the second half of that game.
*  There was one person on Twitter who posted a video and it was during the game. I feel bad. I
*  don't have the person's name, but he posted it and it got sent around in like NFL circles
*  immediately after the game about the play and said, you know, Tua's performance, you know,
*  nosedive right after this play. But yes, he's not playing this week. And I'll tell you, I talked to
*  folks in Miami and they're like, Teddy is, this is why we have Teddy and Teddy's a great backup.
*  And I'll say, but no, Tua Tonga Vaialoa was the guy. And like to just think that
*  Teddy Bridgewater is going to step right in and be everything that Tua was. That's not the case.
*  And hopefully he can. And a lot of fans out there of Teddy's game, we've seen him do this before in
*  New Orleans when they went five and oh, when Drew Brees went out, but it's, it's not the same offense
*  to a T as it is with Tua running it for sure. Well, the good news for them is they get to play
*  the Patriots. Did they just fall apart? Like after that loss, after Stevenson fumbles, is that, is
*  that it? Like, is that all she wrote? And I, I know you spoke about this with, I don't know if it was
*  Solak or with, with cousin Sal, where you were like, would you even want to see him in the playoffs
*  again? I said that to Jason McCourty. I was like, your brother's on the team. You played for that
*  team. Like at this point, and he's like, I, I don't know, because last year they got to the wild
*  car round and just got absolutely embarrassed. And that's almost the worst way to go out than
*  just getting a good draft back. And I'm like, really? Is that how Patriots fans are feeling?
*  Like you'd almost rather just have a top 15 pick than even get into the wild card. It could be
*  like a top eight or nine pick. What's your thoughts as a Patriots fan after watching the last two
*  weeks, how they've lost those games? I'm on the record. I would rather see this team go seven
*  and 10. I think this team has no chance at all in the playoffs. I, here's some stats for you.
*  Last five weeks, their bottom 10 DVO way for the season, 32nd in the red zone,
*  they only have 38.5% touchdowns. They're red zone. So they're the worst team in the league
*  in the red zone. They're 29th and first downs. They're 26th and third down percentage 34.9.
*  They have 26 offensive TDs, which is six from last. They're 30% on fourth down,
*  which is second to last in the league. There's three for 10 on fourth down. They have 96 offensive
*  penalties, which is the six highest. Their best receiver is in the top 35 receiving yards.
*  Rob Andre has been, I think a little bit hurt for the last couple of weeks. And I think you could
*  argue Max one of the five worst starting quarterbacks in the league. And I don't see,
*  we just had a 15 game sample size of this combined with how bad the coaching staff is.
*  I just don't see them beating this Miami team, whoever the quarterback is on Miami. Miami already
*  kicked the shit out of them the first time they played in Miami, in Miami, but still they were,
*  they were super physical with them. I don't, their cornerbacks. Did you see the cornerback
*  situation for the Pats? I don't know who's covering Marc losing Marcus Jones, who was the kick
*  Turner, who was an important quarterback. I, um, I just don't see how they're going to hang with
*  them. And I also feel like Miami is a little undervalued. They were about to be green Bay
*  and two of them got concussed and he threw three picks in the fourth quarter. Inexplicable.
*  Their defense was good in that game. Their defense gave up three hundred one yards on 65 plays.
*  Their offense put the defense in some real tough spots. Plus you had a ridiculous onside
*  kick call early on that gave them half a field. There was missed, uh, missed opportunities all
*  over the place by the dolphins offense that the all dolphins defense was put in a real tough spot.
*  They actually played really good against Rogers last week. They did. Rogers did not light them
*  up. He had one big pass to Mercedes Lewis. But like, if you look at the way that those possessions
*  started for the Miami defense, whether it was, you know, mistakes or turnovers, whatever, they
*  were packed up in their own territory and they stopped green Bay a bunch of times. So I'm with
*  you. It's more about whether Belichick can I've never seen a Belichick team does not show up and
*  fight though. Like, do you think they just don't they're just done? Is that how you look at this?
*  Have you watched the season? I think they're done. They came all the way back last week.
*  Yeah. But did you watch the game though? I mean, they got, I was texting you throughout.
*  They got a suit. They're up. They're down 22. They get a super fluke. You pick six. Yeah.
*  They get a Hail Mary that just bounces off somebody and goes, I did not know who Scotty
*  Washington was. They got missed extra points and miss field goals from McPherson. I don't know.
*  The Bengals finished with 22 points. It should have been 30 plus. And I just don't think the
*  Pats are good. And people keep thinking like, you know, my friends are, yeah, you're trying to
*  reverse jinx the Pats. I'm really not. I care about the million dollar picks more than the Pats at this
*  point. They have just botched the season. It's really upsetting. I mean, it's funny. Like these,
*  like not the rumor. I could tell you, there's a lot of talk of Bill O'Brien returning. Like,
*  does that excite you? Like, I don't know. He's an actual coach. It does. Okay. All right. He's
*  running offense. He knows what he's doing. I just, I almost wonder if it would do this whole thing
*  a favor of Belichick hired outside his little tree. He's not doing that anymore. He doesn't want to
*  do that anymore. He just wants like either people he already knew or people he's related to.
