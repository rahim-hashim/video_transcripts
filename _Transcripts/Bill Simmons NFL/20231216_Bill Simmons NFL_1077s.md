# Is Taylor Swift Ruining the Chiefs? Just Kidding! With Nora Princiotti | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [December 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vzv0hRCO4SA)
*  Two months in, the Chiefs are reeling a little bit.
*  Where are we with Taylor and Travis and the Chiefs?
*  Just give us the update.
*  I mean, Taylor's fine.
*  Taylor's killing it.
*  Taylor just had her birthday party in New York.
*  She's hanging out with Blake Lively.
*  Everything in the Taylor world is great.
*  I personally am a little nervous.
*  I'm holding my breath that she is going to start getting blamed
*  for the Chiefs' struggles, which are not her fault.
*  They're not Travis' fault either,
*  but I just I wonder if the tide is going to turn from the NFL side.
*  But I don't think she really cares about that.
*  She's just she's living her life.
*  Well, first of all, everybody's afraid to criticize
*  or even look cross-eyed at her for two seconds.
*  So you got that piece.
*  Did you see Bailey Zappi talk about her
*  because he said that he used to like her when she was country.
*  And the way that he backtracked was like it is like the Kremlin.
*  It's like, no, so I like country music and she used to do country music,
*  but now she's pop and I'm listening to pop music.
*  But like really so much respect for her.
*  And really everyone is really afraid.
*  I noticed when that Time magazine cover story that you and Nathan broke down,
*  which got an emerge is the first ever magazine piece of emergency podcast
*  I think we've ever done at the Ringer or Grantland.
*  I was really proud of both you.
*  But she just does a drive by shooting of Kim Kardashian at one point.
*  Much deserved, by the way, much deservedly.
*  Absolutely no lies in that statement.
*  No lies.
*  It had been brewing for seven years.
*  And she's wired like Michael Jordan, where she remembers every slight,
*  every just every time her feelings have been hurt by anyone.
*  It's always she's always going to get revenge at some point.
*  And what was interesting was I don't think Kim said a peep, right?
*  She just was like, cool, I'm out sort of like inching towards sort of trying
*  to see if there could be forgiveness.
*  Like she was using she was using Taylor songs in her Instagram stories.
*  And she said something in an interview maybe last year about how,
*  you know, Kanye really made her do it with the video and blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  So there hadn't been any sort of direct overture, but there had been.
*  You could tell she was trying to creep back into the good graces.
*  And Taylor just slammed the door.
*  I hope she never, ever gives her one second of the time of day, because
*  when the world reversed and Kim had Kim had a little more power
*  and a bigger platform in some ways and Taylor was a little bit vulnerable.
*  Kim Kim sees she jumped on it with that weird edited.
*  I just thought the whole thing was just lousy.
*  I didn't like it when she never Taylor never should,
*  because the problem for her with Kim and Kanye always
*  was that they could be messy in a way that she can't be messy.
*  Like you've bought it. If you buy into the Kardashians, you're buying into drama.
*  But Taylor takes a reputational hit if she's like nasty or rude or anything.
*  So she can't like she can't get dirty in the way that they can.
*  They are bad. I mean, obviously, now that Kanye conversation is completely different.
*  But just anything in that orbit is bad news.
*  Well, I mean, her documentary and she's one of the people
*  that kind of ushered in the air of the infomercial documentary.
*  It's a documentary, but not really the artist is in charge of it.
*  We're only getting little snippets of real, real stuff.
*  That is interesting because they're controlling most of it.
*  But the most interesting part of that documentary was was the 2009, the video awards
*  Kanye coming on stage and just how traumatized that was.
*  I never really thought about it since that happened, and it made me feel terrible for her.
*  Well, the thing that the thing that I learned from that for the first time,
*  I think anybody who followed her learned for the first time is that she thought
*  people were booing her when they were booing him, which I do think was a massively
*  moment of psychological damage.
*  The most interesting part of the Miss Americana documentary to me
*  was when her father compared her career to Bob Hope's.
*  That just that to me was really eye opening.
*  What does that mean?
*  It was about her like talking about politics and he was like,
*  Bob Hope never did this.
*  And her mom is just like, what the heck are you talking about?
*  It is the most illuminating just like look at her inner circle.
*  But the time profile was exactly like the documentary.
*  This is a tailor thing.
*  She doesn't talk to the press.
*  She doesn't need traditional media.
*  She doesn't need to do profiles all the time.
*  Blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  She turns everything down.
*  And then every three or four years, she just does one thing.
*  And she gives some comment
*  on every topic people have cared about that relates to her over the last couple of years.
*  So it's like it's like the notebook dump.
*  But for as an interview about her life, she just doesn't know it's dumb.
*  And there's no like detail about.
*  Exactly what happened or it's all very it's all very planned
*  and thought out and strategic.
*  But she just will tell you exactly what she thought about
*  Scooter Braun and the Kim stuff and going out more in public
*  and just like everything that is a big tailor topic, she will just address it.
*  So I saw a lot of parallels between the doc and the time thing.
*  I'm going to give you a Taylor Travis take.
*  This is great. I never get to talk about this stuff for my podcast.
*  I'm sure there's like 20 percent of people are like, you fucking kidding me?
*  Can you just get to whether Belichick's come back?
*  Dad's Brad and Chad.
*  Let me cook. Let me cook.
*  I got my apron on. Let me cook.
*  So I read this thing because I talked with my wife and I were both kind of fascinated.
*  We like celebrity relationships in general, and Taylor's been in our life for a while.
*  I'm fascinated by the concept of fame.
*  She's the most famous person I think we've seen.
*  As an artist, really, probably since Michael Jackson, I think that's fair.
*  And you got you and Nathan talked about that a lot and Michael Jackson did not.
*  And fame is also totally different now, too.
*  True, true.
*  And you have to monitor it 24 7 constantly in a way that maybe Michael Jackson didn't.
*  The thing that concerns me about the future of their relationship.
*  So I saw he was planning a birthday party for her.
*  Travis Kelsey, he's making like 11 million a year playing for the NBA.
*  He's making money from his podcast.
*  He's got some endorsements.
*  I'm going to say he's in the low 20s, but you're dating Taylor Swift or you're dating anybody that famous.
*  It's not like he's like, hey, Taylor, I got us two first class tickets on Delta to fly to Kansas City.
*  Like you're private everywhere you go.
*  You have handlers everywhere you go.
*  You're in the penthouse suite everywhere you go.
*  There's a lifestyle thing that I think only a few people could date her.
*  But also have the money, which then means she's paying for most of the stuff.
*  And then that gets into a whole, this is weird.
*  You're paying for stuff.
*  I just don't know how that plays out.
*  There's a TikTok that I love that I have saved where I don't know, it's just two random people.
*  But one of the guys is like, you know, he's a mid forties like guy.
*  And somebody is explaining, somebody is saying, guess Travis Kelsey's net worth and then guess the net worth of Taylor Swift's cat.
*  Dr. Olivia Benson, or it actually might be Meredith.
*  I forget which cat it is.
*  OK, one of the cats is that like 93 mil and Travis is around 30 or whatever.
*  One of the cats is at 93 mil.
*  I mean, I don't know.
*  But yes, allegedly, because she's done commercials and she's endorsed some products.
*  And the guy is just is just sort of like processing this information.
*  And he starts laughing and just asking the right questions as in so people know like Taylor Swift fans can identify the cat in a commercial fast enough so that fancy feast would blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  And it's a really special.
*  It's a special moment.
*  So I hear where you're coming from.
*  Yeah, because I just wonder, like when you're that famous and that rich, can you only date other people who are in your kind of network?
*  Of wealth or maybe she maybe she's on the flip side.
*  Maybe it's not about that.
*  And she's such a great.
*  I don't know. I'm just I'm monitoring it because there's lots of different reasons these go sideways.
*  Is it easier in some ways because there's no question about who is orchestrating the logistics of everything.
*  Oh, I like the Oprah Stedman.
*  The Oprah Stedman.
*  She's if they're going somewhere, she's saying, Travis, you know, go to the airfields at this time.
*  Plane's going to be there for you.
*  Get on. Come to me.
*  I've got the car. I've got it under control.
*  I don't quite understand what happened with the birthday party because on her birthday, she went to Zero Bond, which is a club in New York that she's been going to for months and months and months.
*  So I don't think he I'm not sure I buy that he was planning anything and then he didn't maybe just the game for football stuff.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Something seemed fishy about that.
*  So I wonder if why this has worked out so far is that it gets to be really on her terms.
*  I think I've lived through a lot of celebrity relationships.
*  I think this is one of the better ones.
*  I like the two different worlds that they come from.
*  Seems like they like each other.
*  They're around the same age and they both kind of get something out of it, which is always a key to the celebrity relationship.
*  Right. Like when Jennifer Aniston starts dating Brad Pitt, he's this on the rise.
*  Movie star about to be an A-list there.
*  She's on Friends. She's an A-list there.
*  And it's like, look at us.
*  The two now it almost is like the one plus one equals three, which is what it feels like here.
*  I mean, for what it's done for him from a career standpoint has been kind of jaw dropping.
*  Yeah. But she also seems pretty cool to date.
*  I don't know. Like, kudos to him.
*  I'll be interested. Do you think they get engaged?
*  I have no idea. I just simply have no clue.
*  She is at that stage of life.
*  It seems like they're moving very fast.
*  But I also don't know.
*  Like, she has that celebrity thing where you're sort of frozen.
*  And she said this, I think she said this in the Miss Americana doc, where you're sort of frozen at the age you get famous.
*  Yeah. I think in her brain, there's a part of her that's just still 15.
*  And I think it makes it very hard to figure out, you know, is she.
*  Really ready for that?
*  Does she really want that is all of the stuff with the tour
*  gearing up to take a step back and maybe start a family and blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  I assume she wants that.
*  But the tour is going to be ongoing for another year plus.
*  Yeah. And how does that work?
*  It's like why the movie actors break up because one of them is doing a movie somewhere for nine months.
*  The other one's somewhere else for nine months.
*  Singapore and she's in Germany and she's in Edinburgh and she's all over the world.
*  So there's definitely some sort of logistical questions, but it even feels like that's starting to happen.
*  Some phone calls. Yeah.
*  They'll do a lot of FaceTime.
*  I'm sure she's used to that.
*  But then again, not really, because the relationship with Joe Alwyn
*  started when she retreated from the world because everybody hated her and she was a snake.
*  And then the pandemic started.
*  So they were sort of inside together for like six years.
*  And now she won't even she won't say like the United Kingdom out loud in the timepiece.
*  One of the little funny tidbits was she said, I moved to a foreign country.
*  Like she wouldn't say I moved to London. I moved to the UK.
*  It was just like. That place that I will not name and that person who I am.
*  It got that acrimonious.
*  So like going through it, too.
*  So I don't know. They're they're having fun.
*  So what was the first year she became legitimately famous?
*  2009, 2009 was her rookie year of fame.
*  Yeah, I think there's three there's sort of three levels to it.
*  And one of them was fearless.
*  The VMA is that that kind of moment, which was love story and you belong with me.
*  And then the second one was 1989, which was like 2014, because that was the squad.
*  And that was the bringing the U.S.
*  women's national team out on stage.
*  And that was huge. That was her first stadium.
*  Also, also, that was really when she hit Zoe Simmons in the biggest possible way.
*  Yeah, that's when I that's when she got on my radar.
*  So that never gets mentioned in that phase. But keep going.
*  And then the third one is just now the third one is as the last year plus
*  and kind of coming out of her owning the pandemic with folklore and evermore.
*  Brought her to a new stratosphere, so there's sort of it's like
*  there's a three tiered thing to it.
*  Yes. So if you take Michael Jackson, he's famous in the mid 70s with the Jackson five.
*  And then that goes all the way to when he becomes a solo artist with Off the Wall,
*  which is around like seventy nine, eighty, eighty one range.
*  And then Thriller is eighty two, eighty three.
*  And then it keeps going really far.
*  Another, I would say, twelve years.
*  And then he becomes, you know, where all these artists end up going,
*  where they become the greatest hits version of themselves.
*  But she's not even close to being the greatest hits version.
*  And then if you look at her versus female artists.
*  It's like basically her and Barbra Streisand, I think, for keeping it together
*  as an A plus lister for this long, because Barbra Streisand,
*  not only did she have the music, but she became one of the biggest movie stars
*  in the world for like six, seven years, which is a piece where I don't see that.
*  Taylor hasn't really done that yet.
*  No, I don't see it happening.
*  Katz didn't exactly open up a new chapter.
*  I don't see that one happening.
*  But yeah, she's in pretty crazy air where she's in the second part
*  of her second decade of being massively, massively famous.
*  And then all of the things are almost like decisions
*  AI would have made for a superstar, even dating a famous football player.
*  It's just like a really good career move.
*  Not to mention, she seems like she likes it.
*  Here's the thing. Here's the thing about I think sometimes
*  Nathan and I were talking about this recently.
*  The comp to me is LeBron.
*  In the sense that.
*  A superstar who's been around.
*  For so long, and we have such a public history with.
*  Yeah. And at a certain point, you sort of get to a place where it's like, OK,
*  I know this person rubs some people the wrong way,
*  but if the worst thing that you can if they've managed
*  early fame and all of the success
*  in a way where it's like, look at other people,
*  like look at other people who got famous and successful and rich that young.
*  They're not doing well.
*  And the worst thing you can say about Taylor Swift is like.
*  I don't like the faces she makes at awards shows.
*  She seems a little annoying.
*  Like, that's a pretty high bar at a certain point.
*  And that's sort of I mean, I ride very hard for her for a lot of reasons.
*  But I think that's one of them.
*  Yeah, that's a really good point.
*  Like how many how many female artists became famous?
*  Either in their late teen, mid late teens or in their 20s.
*  And it started to go sideways within like five, six years.
*  And it never one inch went sideways with her.
*  And if it did, we didn't even really know about it.
*  Right. I mean, like, what's the worst?
*  You know, I'm sure people would have different answers to this.
*  But if the worst thing that she's ever done is that she didn't
*  speak up politically in 2016 and came to regret it.
*  And, you know, it's.
*  I mean, I think she regrets that it's probably unfortunate to a lot of fans.
*  But I don't know that there's there are worse indictments out there than that.
*  Well, also, though, and you saw with the concert tour,
*  the amount of songs that she has at this point that people have
*  genuinely connected to.
*  And you're talking three generations now of fans
*  that different songs mean different things.
*  It's really it's it's a little Springsteen ish, because this is what
*  Springsteen was like at his peak, where he had enough of a catalog
*  and enough albums.
*  And people argued about what the different album, which was the best one.
*  What was his best song?
*  Everybody kind of had their three or four favorite
*  Springsteen songs that were their songs.
*  And it's very similar to it. Reminds me of that.
*  I want to know how long it'll last.
*  Like, I wonder when I'm because, you know.
*  If I have kids, I will definitely be in the car at home or whatever, going like,
*  you got to listen to this. This is Taylor Swift.
*  Like, I love Taylor Swift.
*  Was the biggest thing when I was growing up and blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  Will they roll their eyes at that and be like, whatever?
*  Or will it be cool?
*  Will it be like, oh, yeah, I want to get into the classics
*  or she's such an icon, I have to know like what in however many years
*  where she'll be because she's really captured.
*  I mean, she's captured young, young, young people now.
*  And what kind of staying power that leads to, I think will be be fascinating.
*  Well, and she also ruined the Chiefs.
*  No, I'm just kidding. I didn't really mean that.
*  He's an adult man.
*  He is an adult man who can make his own decisions.
*  You know what ruined the Chiefs?
*  The fact that Travis Kelsey is 34 and plays a position where you get the shit
*  kicked out of you every week and tight end usually last eight to ten years.
*  The fact that they have a wide receiver group that can't catch
*  and doesn't know where to stand. Right. Right.
*  And drops big plays.
*  And they're one of those where they could easily have three more wins.
*  You get three more plays, three more wins and they would have.
*  I am like really flirting with being just completely out on them.
*  It's there to my homes throwing to wide receivers.
*  My home throwing them to running backs and tight ends is like as my homes as ever.
*  My home is throwing a wide receivers is in like Desmond
*  Redder territory statistically.
*  I just I don't like you can't win a Super Bowl like that.
