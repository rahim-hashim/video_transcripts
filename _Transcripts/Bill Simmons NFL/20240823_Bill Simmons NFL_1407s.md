# Five Favorite NFL Offenses With Kevin Clark  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [August 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8AsKs5f3n8)
*  original OG Ringer employee Kevin Clark now at ESPN you see him on your TV can
*  you can see him on your YouTube's still talking football still whipping out the
*  takes it's great to see you I'm so happy to be here that your lighting is
*  phenomenal we discussed how the window and being in front of you is just change
*  window I know yeah big window lighting's important I asked you what you want to
*  do for five favorites yeah we negotiated a little bit it's in the offensive realm
*  it is we didn't know whether it's fun whether it's red zone watch watchable
*  watchable so so what we used to do with the at the ranger was our top we go 1
*  through 32 top teams you want to see on red zone and we always used to call got
*  Hanson and I just fill it on out and they would give great takes on what makes
*  a great red zone team and it's what makes a great offense they score touchdowns
*  they don't meander like that explosive plays normally it's a running
*  quarterback like we know what it looks like so it's just things without
*  difference I say top five most watchable we can also go with your advantage so
*  the Patriots will not be on this list can I defend trick me for 30 seconds I'd
*  love it I mean I have a lot of I'm hoping he's my quarterback for the next
*  20 years of my life so please do so I went to a practice and he looks bad
*  was not uncommon in the early part of it but he just didn't play we're gonna get
*  to some of these rookie quarterbacks on my list but like he's learning pro
*  football which is a completely different game than college they just
*  frankly has never seen a good disguise blitz in his life like that's how the
*  college game is now okay the way the hash marks are where the athletes are
*  just a little bit different and then he's going against a bunch of guys who
*  learn defense from Bill Belichick like it's gonna look bad he just hasn't
*  played enough football and hasn't played enough pro football for him for it to
*  look anything other than struggling he seemed confused pre-staff when I was
*  there and post-staff and he's only a couple deaths there are other snaps or
*  those who may too priest I think you got a handle on it at the mall he's got
*  what about mid-step?
*  No but like he would like have desperation shovel passes and stuff
*  because it was clear to me at least that he didn't know what was coming or the
*  pressure was coming but like that's just gonna happen in training camp that's
*  what it's for so I'm still I had Drake Maystack and I'm holding on to it and
*  anything I saw at that practice I'm discarding because it would hurt my
*  priors well now he's been doing a lot better and they're talking about
*  potentially him starting in week one which I think is it's not the dumbest
*  thing of the 2020s but it's in the conversation because they have a brutal
*  schedule the first four games we have no right tackle we have no left tackle
*  he's 21 years old and he took this huge hit in the Eagles game where the left
*  tackle just missed the block Drake May gets Drake May gets
*  pancaked it looked like he was like landed on his shoulder my dad and I were
*  watching we're like just put him on ice until like week six I don't want to see
*  him how would you feel if you're Jacobi
*  Brissette and like the literal line is hey why don't we get this guy hurt like
*  which is someone's gonna get hurt it might as well be that guy but you know
*  that's what the money's for situation there with Jacobi Brissette I think this
*  is his probably last dance at being a starting QB so he's probably I agree
*  he's about to move into the phase where he's standing next to the coach a lot
*  and he's got a cool hat on and looks like concern during two-minute warnings
*  he's two steps we could play this game all day long he's two steps from
*  podcasting because because you're one step you're like just a career backup
*  like two years that's interesting how many steps is that so set to the first
*  step is backup QB yeah there's not a second step where you're like well no
*  it's back up so so with Brissette I think it's backup QB with like a really
*  good starter like Kansas City where it's like he's never gonna play who was the
*  Brandon Wieden when he was back up with Dallas he literally said God forbid I
*  have to play because like you don't that means the starting quarterbacks out like
*  that kind of guy but you see these guys all the time Brissette's not there you see
*  them on August 5th every training camp they have a pouch in their stomach yeah
*  and they have they're basically vibes guys they're always wearing a branded
*  golf hat and they've just stepped off the course it looks like and they have
*  no interest in playing they're there just to run the offense that they're
*  just to be in meetings that's the first step before podcasting the last step
*  before podcasting sounds amazing
*  the Jacobi the next step is is that what I just described it might be next year
*  for you and then we're we're headed to the podcast room you're gonna count
*  down from five to one your favorite red zone offenses so give us number five
*  all right red zone channel offense is most watchable offenses this one's gonna
*  surprise people this is not best offense please do not say well you lift off the
*  Becker's this is not best offenses the Washington commanders of Jade and
*  Daniels are going to be so unbelievably fun to watch so Jayden Daniels is one of
*  these guys and there's a couple of them in this draft and there's gonna be more
*  coming I call them doctor quarterbacks because they played for so many years in
*  college and they just played football but there's a stat that Bo Nicks like
*  that's get the oldest week one starter ever the other guys were either playing
*  minor league baseball or in the army like Roger Staubach yeah so Bo Nicks was
*  just playing football and Jayden Daniels is the same my brain Jayden Daniels
*  threw a touchdown pass to Brandon Iacon in college to beat Justin Herbert he's
*  played a million years I think he had double the career pass attempts that
*  that um Patricia McCarthy had and so you look at that and I talked to the
*  quarterback coach to be the preacher when I was a practice couple weeks ago
*  and he was like the thing with these guys now is the transfer portal has has
*  become one of the most important things in football because in pro football
*  because these guys are able to find a home they're able to get different
*  coaching and there's so much tape and so much data in our head that they're
*  almost like the Drake may be the opposite but like they're basically pros
*  you know as far as preparation and as far as experience and that stuff they
*  just have to get the final piece but Jayden Daniels is ready to push the ball
*  down the field like right now he broke Joe Burrows explosive record like for
*  all-time explosive plays in the college level Cliff Kingsbury is gonna
*  understand what he can do they're already meeting with him figuring out
*  like what he likes to do inside fades I saw a nice wheel route the other day
*  they went deep like they're gonna be able to push the ball down the field
*  really quickly and the other part of it is like he plays he takes a lot of sacks
*  and he holds on to the ball like there's always going to be excitement with
*  Jayden Daniels and I don't think we're necessarily giving that enough attention
*  so you're thinking big plays fumble touchdowns for the defense maybe a
*  couple picks and then what he did in college which he just takes off and he
*  runs for like 45 yards and say what you love about Cook Kingsbury you can say a
*  lot of things he can design a run he can design a run I remember Steve
*  Murray's once saying that if nothing else he'd hire when they when they hired
*  him in Arizona like he said he would hire him as run game coordinator and
*  like that's always been kind of his dancing and so I had nothing else there
*  will be good schematic stuff for Jayden Daniels early like we too early like too
*  often conflate making our rookie quarterbacks life easy with babying him
*  we're always like oh we gotta check down to get a tight end or whatever it's
*  like no do what he's comfortable with and what Jayden Daniels is comfortable with is
*  throwing the ball 40 yards downfield right so he's on Fando is 6 to 1 to win
*  offensive rookie of the year and Caleb Williams is plus 120 so and Harrison's
*  plus 650 and to me it's like I think all three of those should be dead even I I
*  could totally see Harrison winning offensive rookie of the year it looks
*  like he's gonna be incredible and I may or may not have been on a couple
*  Pat's fan text threads were kind of like oof hope hope he doesn't turn into like
*  the best wide receiver of all time that would suck we didn't take him but Caleb
*  versus Jayden is like yeah they're both in good situations they're both gonna
*  throw the ball time I don't know why one would be so higher than the other well
*  Caleb is coming into the best situation for number one overall pick ever like
*  to have Roma Dunes A and then the two better ends DJ Moore and Keenan Allen
*  even though there's some weirdness around Keenan Allen he's getting all the things
*  that Justin Fields didn't get and I think people are understanding that he's
*  gonna have been some success to it the founder for that franchise counter Sam
*  Howell came within a stone's throw of throwing for 4,000 yards last year do you
*  know that like never had 50 yards passing and it's like I don't remember
*  any of them so all right go to number four there was like a three week period
*  where you get yelled at by commander's fans and said Sam Howell wasn't the
*  future it was incredible right it was incredible yeah and then he would get
*  sacked ten more times all right number four is all right number four this guy
*  has the potential to be the most exciting player in football he is the
*  fastest quarterback in history of the combine he two tenths faster than Cam
*  Newton and three tenths faster than Josh Allen he is a vertically over 40
*  inches five inches better than Cam Newton's it is Anthony Richardson and the
*  Indianapolis Colts so wow what a noise what a noise we played one month last
*  year and he was one of the best in the NFL very very small sample size but the
*  one of the best in film is perfectly covered place which means like the
*  defense does its job and you still you still deliver and he reached 21 miles
*  per hour when he ran fastest by QB without the ball since 2016 according to
*  next gen stats there was a thing this week where Bengals defenders were like
*  making fun of his throwing or whatever he wasn't as developers a pastor I'm
*  betting big on the athleticism I'm also betting big on Shane Stryken is a really good coach
*  Jonathan Taylor in that backfield the line is good the defense is gonna be
*  good enough like so I can I went back and forth a couple weeks ago on this
*  he's he's not that into the defensive backfield I don't care I'm not picking
*  them to beat the Chiefs here I'm picking them to be excited they're gonna be
*  unbelievable to watch if Richardson stays healthy which by the way is always been a question
*  I like their skill guys I actually like their wide receiver crew Taylor coming out they
*  settled his contract they have good offensive line he's in a great spot I
*  just have no idea if he's good it seems like people have been pretty split on
*  the preseason with him yes no yes and and part of this I want to see
*  schematically like what they do like it's so hard if if the if the question is
*  role like what are you gonna do with the guy it's so hard to decipher that in
*  preseason because guys don't want to show anything like yeah last year Mike
*  McDaniel changed offense and nobody in Miami on like August 10th was like well
*  Mike McDaniel is gonna change offense no they did it in in Los Angeles the first
*  week of the season it was under wraps so like I think if you're gonna it's hard
*  for me to read anything into that like they need to keep him healthy he needs
*  to take it another step but like his potential is unbelievable I mean it's
*  very it's very job challenge right where you just there's just so many questions
*  and so many things have to go right but like if it does go right everything
*  changes in the AFC they are definitely on my radar is like I can't wait to see
*  what happens with this team and he seems like he's in a good spot I think they're
*  from Jacksonville Tennessee to I think could be crap teams in the division seems
*  set up for him good coach also also yeah I was gonna say turns out Shane
*  Steichen was really important to Philadelphia because last year they had
*  no second pitch when they couldn't handle the Blitz and so maybe Shane
*  Steichen was a really freaking good coach which is funny because it happened
*  years ago with the Super Bowl team the Nick Foles team where everybody was like
*  well it was actually you know Frank Reich or people thought it was John DeFilippo
*  all this stuff and it's like well it's a lot of guys but like Shane Steichen was
*  very important to that Super Bowl team two years ago all right number three is
*  an easy one but it's it's not like what you think it's the Chiefs and there's a
*  couple things about it was plenty I was reading this thing the other day
*  where what I don't know that's a little fine go ahead let's hear the case all
*  right so there was a thing of the day I was reading an article in PFF it was
*  like everybody's weakness and it was that Mahomes bailed from the pocket too
*  early and tries to make these crazy plays and that's what you want if you're
*  just saying let's let's let's be entertaining like he wants to make a
*  play happen all the time but the most important thing to me bill is the
*  chemistry as of Kelsey it is well it is a basketball team like Kelsey doesn't
*  even I'm a bunch of plays he doesn't even run routes man he just finds holes
*  in the defense puts his hand up and like posts up and calls for the ball I've
*  never seen anything like it maybe maybe I'm I'm just gonna ball or whatever like
*  Colt McCoy did a great breakdown of this for the Super Bowl we're like against
*  every coverage Travis Kelsey just sort of wanders out into the defense they know
*  exactly where they're gonna be and he gets an 11 yard game I've never seen
*  anything like it and it's one of the coolest things and it's sort of hard to
*  pick up on a part to see on the TV copy all of that stuff like the nuances of
*  those two guys in their chemistry is as special as anything as there is in
*  football right now and I just I can't get enough I would add for the case for
*  the Chiefs if worthy becomes like a really fun toy yes which you can see
*  some of the preseason they're putting them in different spots and just telling
*  them basically run fast Mahomes will find them it does feel like he might
*  play more than hey you know the fast receivers that are like late first round
*  early second round it just feels like a fucking coin flip whether those guys are
*  good or not there's no no rhyme or reason to it but it seems like he might
*  actually be good well then the improv like the biggest part with the Chiefs
*  the improvisation down the field like a bread beecher GM told make up years ago
*  like you have to scout they actually bread beech actually studied
*  Rappersberger and Antonio Brown but years ago when when Mahomes was young
*  because he was looking at like what happens when plays break down these guys
*  find each other again like a basketball team and so it's worthy the biggest
*  thing is like what happens in the eighth second of a play like Tyra kill was so
*  good at just finding these zones where nobody was gonna be using their speed
*  to the advantage like worthy to me I joke about this but it's becoming less
*  and less of a joke were they to me is like the most important player in
*  football this year because if he's a legitimate receiver the league is over
*  like if you're the Bills and you look at the Chiefs and they've got Xavier
*  worthy like as a new Tyree kill in your one you're like the hell are we gonna do
*  like he really is the X factor to the entire league and Hollywood Brown is
*  there there's just there's a lot there's a lot here I mean the biggest problem
*  for the entire league bill is that last year they the Chiefs are the hardest
*  path by DVOA in the history of the playoffs they had the worst team in the
*  Mahomes read era and they won the Super Bowl like I don't it seems very
*  discouraging if you're trying to build a contender in this era well I mean
*  there's a lot of things that you have to think can this happen again and also
*  this has never happened like the three Pete which has never happened since
*  we've started football but that yeah you go back that Buffalo game I can still
*  see Alan missing digs but in the middle and it's like just what happens if he
*  hits that pass I wonder if the Chiefs win that game if I was a Bills fan that
*  game would make me crazy yeah the Shakira there's a secure touchdown that
*  should have happened there were a bunch of ways all right number two the Miami
*  Dolphins so there's something here with with the Miami Dolphins that is really
*  special first of all like if you look when if you look at waddle and Hill and
*  how fast they move they're the fastest team like ever waddle was 20 first 20
*  miles per hour or more on six point five percent of his plays the last two years
*  and the only person with more is Tyree Kill who's a ten percent and and that's
*  like double anybody else I think George Pickens might be third and they just
*  move in a way that Mike McDaniel like the motions they have that Mike McDaniel
*  uses in such a special way and the efficiency is what's kind of amazing
*  because they run the ball at on they rotate a little bit and the efficiency
*  is I think that Tyree Kill like you look at usage rate Tyree Kill caught a pass
*  on like more a higher percent of his routes than like any player in history
*  last year like he when he when he goes out for a route he normally gets the
*  ball and there's an efficiency there that is just stunning and the fact that
*  they spread the ball around too is really incredible and so I think that
*  just generally we've never seen an offense like this and and I don't know
*  if it's even possible to have it again one and six against playoff teams last
*  year had their pants pulled down in the KC
*  playoff game no I'm just like I've been on some Dolphins text threads JJ
*  you remember JJ Dolphins fan that's my guy and he's kind of touchy-feely about
*  the Dolphins because everyone's kind of out on them and he's upset about it and
*  I don't know if you told me this will continue and it will still be the most
*  fun offense like it was last year or this could go really badly I think I
*  lean toward the really badly but I'm not ruling out the other side either I
*  just think there's so many fast guys they just have you just keep it coming you
*  know and and I think that there's they build it on speed that's their identity
*  I get it. They can have a floor with two of them. They're super fun to watch. I'm closer to
*  Tyree Kill. Now he's paid now it's like when he does the thing where it's
*  like oh my leg hurts and he comes out his helmets off there's like my legs
*  fine and he goes back in I don't know I just the hold in the hold in I love the
*  hold in during the game hold in we're just for like the one series hold in
*  all right Miami's won so I should have been there at the ringer. The hold in? That would have been amazing.
*  In the middle of a podcast you're like oh man I have six months left on my deal I'm gonna just start I'm gonna sit this one out
*  Noor you take this one. Number one is the Houston Jackson's. I love it.
*  So it's DJ Stroud had the best deep passing rating passer rating in the history of the sport last year.
*  He was a rookie by the way and when he struggled he struggled on intermediate to short passes he
*  struggled on the on target passes and they went out and they got Siphan Diggs who's one of the best
*  intermediate receivers in football last year. It always has been. It's just reliable and it's
*  always gonna get open. They weirdly I don't agree with what they did but they
*  really put Diggs into a contract here so he's gonna be motivated.
*  Niko Collins is good at every single thing on a football field great against man great against zone
*  he's just really really really good but more than anything it's just that CJ Stroud like the thing
*  that always I always think about no one threw past the sticks more than CJ Stroud and like in
*  this league now it's become so stupid where everybody and I know I know why you're doing it
*  but I don't like to watch it you're always taking what the defense gives you you're always taking
*  the check down and what CJ Stroud is like what if I threw at 19 yards to Niko Collins what if I did
*  that and like that to me is if you can do that reliably and like it'll change like it was not
*  sustainable that Stroud's deep passer rating last year was 100 points higher than Patrick Mahomes
*  because how they defend Mahomes it's totally fine they're gonna start defending Stroud differently
*  but that's why you add in different pieces you add in different pitches to your game this is just
*  like we're watching something special and what's funny is like we saw it against Georgia two years
*  ago in the playoffs he was dominating them he was doing whatever he wanted to against a almost NFL
*  caliber defense I would never say NFL caliber because of the differences in the two sports but
*  it's just it's it's it's genius at work it's special stuff if we hadn't seen Mahomes so
*  recently we'd be talking about it differently because I think no one can be Mahomes but there's
*  someone here now who's kind of the prince who was promised that they can take on Mahomes in two
*  three years you didn't mention tank dials back he's missing three awesome receivers we'll see
*  what dates they say it always makes me nervous when the Bows like yeah you should go go to
*  another team but the Stroud stuff yeah I was looking at the passing yard leader stuff for him
*  he was like seven to one yeah finish with the most passing yards he had 3500 and 12 games when he
*  got hurt last year he was on pace for almost 5,000 as a rookie and now it's year two his receiving
*  core is better the team I think is just gonna be better in general and the only case against him
*  chucking it the same way would be if they're just good and they're up in games and they're
*  not throwing as much but I'm all in on CJ Stroud stuff I think and yeah he's a possible play
*  passing yards 4,000 yards 4,500 yards like I'm in on all this they also lucked out because Bobby
*  Sloan throw C is coming back like right biggest the whenever defensive coach first of all Domingo
*  Ryan's an awesome coach Brian Callahan told me a couple years ago that when the when the Bengals
*  are playing the Niners they like Domingo Ryan's against Joe Burrow just invented a defense on the
*  fly just like came up with the Tampa two thing they'd never seen on tape and the coaches like
*  what the hell is this and it was it was just because Domingo Ryan's is so good at teaching
*  and coming up with stuff and I thought that was pretty pretty interesting so I always knew he'd
*  be a good coaching candidate but then you have the on the OC like I don't want to get into this
*  whole thing but like one of the funny things about Robert Stalas he keeps hiring these bad
*  OCs and it's like you should be able if you're a defensive coach you should have the best marketing
*  like you have the best job opening in the world it's like you get to run this offense if you're
*  any good you get to be head coach and so like Bobby Sloan has a proof of concept and he didn't
*  get a head job last year that is so important because I'm sure he'll get one this year that
*  to me is a huge huge huge thing in the AFC race I like it Kevin Clark great to see you as always
*  hope all is well in New York City say hi to say hi to all your colleagues for me I will thanks buddy
