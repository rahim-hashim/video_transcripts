# Bill Simmons's Six Major Things Going on in Sports | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [May 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zM7SVAjc5uc)
*  This Celtics run is historic, but historic is the wrong word because nothing's happened
*  and there's nothing really that special about it.
*  So I was thinking about the phrase historic adjacent.
*  Brought to you by Michelob Ultra, the official beer sponsor of the NBA.
*  Win or lose, you're bound to enjoy the ride with a good beer in hand.
*  Michelob Ultra is good beer.
*  The crisp, light and refreshing type of beer with only 95 calories.
*  So we're yourself an ultra six pack while we impact six major things going on in
*  the world of sports and basketball right now.
*  I'm saving my biggest basketball point for last.
*  I had to start with football because I've been thinking a lot about the end of a
*  dynasty.
*  As you know, I'm a Patriot fan.
*  As you know, I love the Patriots and wanted this to keep going forever and ever
*  and ever and it's not, and there's 10 stages.
*  It's like the 10 stages of grief, eight stages of grief, seven stages, whatever
*  the stages are, I have 10.
*  For realizing that your NFL dynasty is really over.
*  First off the end of the era of playoff loss.
*  When you're like, Ooh, we definitely wouldn't have lost a game like that before.
*  That was January, 2020 Brady's last home playoff game.
*  Titans 20, Pats 13.
*  It was bad.
*  Felt like Brady was leaving, felt like the magic was over.
*  Didn't know for sure.
*  Then best part of the leaves are retired.
*  So I was pretty leaving false hope with the new guys is the third sign.
*  So first we had cam Newton.
*  I remember Neffy Kyle bought a cam Newton Jersey or I bought a farm.
*  I can't remember, but we had a cam Newton Jersey in real life.
*  We were excited for it.
*  That fell apart.
*  Then we drafted Mac Jones, false hope yet again, sucked us back.
*  You know how it worked out.
*  The fourth thing is championship envy, which is a weird sensation when your
*  team has been successful for as long as the Patriots were, but you know, Mahomes
*  wins one, you start being like, ah, the new guy.
*  I remember when we were the new guy, then Brady goes to Tampa.
*  He wins one.
*  It's like, Oh man, kind of rooting for Brady.
*  That's pathetic in its own, right?
*  You're rooting for somebody else to win a super bowl.
*  The fifth sign is the playoff loss slash annihilation from a team that you used
*  to own, which in this case was Buffalo, who the Patriots owned for 20 years.
*  January 22nd, our January, 2022 bills 47 Patriots 17 felt like a specific, Oh wow.
*  This is kind of really over that leads to stage six.
*  He looking back at the dynasty, arguing about who was more responsible.
*  Cause we did all that Brady Belichick, who was more responsible with
*  Brady, just one with Tampa.
*  And we argued about this for months.
*  Like it actually mattered because it didn't matter because
*  the dynasty was already over.
*  Number seven, the nagging realization.
*  There's nothing special about the franchise whatsoever anymore.
*  Everything is gone.
*  Brady's gone.
*  Belichick's hit another stage of his career, but you don't really
*  deep down want to admit it yet until stage number eight rock bottom.
*  Rooting against your team to get a better draft pick would have been
*  inconceivable to root against the Patriots at any point in the 21st
*  century until last year we did that, which leads to the ninth sign, dumping
*  the last link of the dynasty Belichick followed by everyone talk about a new
*  direction, new atmosphere.
*  I like the old atmosphere when we won super bowls and made the super bowl
*  almost every other year, but finally the 10th and last one.
*  And this is when it really, really sinks in.
*  This is the last stage of grief.
*  The schedule comes out.
*  The Patriots had no Sunday night games or Monday night games, just a complete shutout.
*  We were in Carolina though.
*  We were in like mid 2010 Jacksonville area and they have one Thursday game,
*  one night game all season, week three at the jets.
*  And then after that, it's just Sundays the rest of the way, because the Patriots
*  suck and nobody cares about them.
*  So those are my 10 stages of grief.
*  Um, speaking of the schedule, my second thing I wanted to hit in the six pack,
*  my single biggest NFL pet peeve.
*  I have a lot of NFL pet peeves.
*  I don't know if anyone's complained about Roger Goodell and the NFL more
*  than I have over the last 20 years.
*  I like to complain.
*  They tilt the schedule every year so that there's too many early
*  games on certain Sundays.
*  Why do they do this?
*  For instance, week two, there's 10 early games on Sunday and three late games,
*  10 early games all at the same time.
*  I can put six games on my TV situation.
*  I think I have a, you know, a, a top, top, top TV situation.
*  There's four games I just can't have on.
*  There's four games I just can't have on at any point.
*  Uh, there's another one week for eight games early, four late week, seven.
*  They only have 10 Sunday games because of bi-week seven early games, three late
*  week, nine, nine early, three late.
*  What are we doing?
*  We like games for six, seven straight hours.
*  I was trying to think of reasons they do this.
*  First reason is they hate us, which I think is probably the
*  leader in the clubhouse.
*  They have a secret deal with the red zone channel to stack two Sundays
*  a year with early games.
*  So people want to watch the red zone possible.
*  They hate us.
*  That's another reason.
*  Um, they think people have TVs with 10 screens.
*  I promise you, we don't.
*  They hate us.
*  That's another reason.
*  Um, they're trying to stack the late afternoon game for CBS and Fox.
*  Like one time each conceivable.
*  And the last thing I thought of was they hate us.
*  10 early games in week two.
*  They hate us.
*  All right.
*  My next thing inside the NBA, as I told you last week, I think
*  Warner already lost the NBA.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I can only pass along things I've heard and intuitions I have.
*  So I think people are starting to realize this, even though there's been some
*  reporting and it's like, no, no, they, Warner has a right to match.
*  It's just, they got to figure out this whole, how they get network.
*  The ship is sealed.
*  So we've moved into, is this it for inside the NBA mode?
*  And people are getting hysterical about this because we hate almost everything
*  inside the NBA is one of the few things we really like inside the NBA is going to
*  be fine if they don't keep the NBA package, which they're not going to.
*  Somebody else is going to take Barkley and they're going to take Kenny and probably
*  Shaq, I think Shaq's it's almost like a salary cap trade.
*  We have to take his contract.
*  I don't know if Ernie leaves TNT slash Turner at this point.
*  He's been there since I think 1892, but Barkley and Kenny, I, to me, this
*  is like a Buck Aikman thing.
*  There'd be a package deal.
*  They'll go somewhere else.
*  And guess what?
*  The NBA wants to keep Barkley and Kenny as a post game show for one of the three
*  streamers that is, that is going to get this package, NBC, Peacock, ESPN, Amazon.
*  They're going to one of those three places.
*  We're not losing those guys.
*  So save your hysteria and sadness is, oh my God, this would be the worst thing ever.
*  Let's not overthink this.
*  Those guys are going to go to one of the three places.
*  Zazloff who's who runs Warner and who's, who's done some things that he's taken
*  heat for, there's no question this would be a deal breaker.
*  Like he's, he's canceled movies, but if he somehow is like, Nope, you're
*  in the contract, you can't leave.
*  There will be no inside the NBA.
*  If we can't have the NBA, then you guys aren't getting that.
*  He's not doing that.
*  So what I think is going to happen, my prediction is it becomes a Buck Aikman
*  situation, Amazon will back up the truck.
*  And I wouldn't count out ESPN and I wouldn't count out NBC.
*  There's three suitors and guess what?
*  All of them are going to want Barkley and Kenny.
*  So those guys are fine.
*  Save your tears.
*  Fourth thing I have for you playoff hockey.
*  I am now a casual Bruins fan, as you know, and this is, you know, it's
*  bittersweet for me because when I was growing up all the way through college, I
*  loved hockey as much as I love basketball, football, baseball.
*  I've written about this in the past.
*  Uh, the Bruins owner ruined hockey for me.
*  I just didn't care as much.
*  The regular season became irrelevant and now I am a casual Bruins fan.
*  I just watched the playoffs and that's it.
*  I pop in, I pop out.
*  I don't tweet about hockey.
*  I don't talk about it on the podcast because you know why the NHL fans love
*  the death, their lunatics.
*  It's like only they can talk about the sport, only they can consume it.
*  And if you're a casual fan, you just have to stay out of it.
*  I respect it.
*  As you can see, I stay out of hockey, but I still watch hockey and I still
*  watch Bruins playoff games and I still know what's going on.
*  So I'm just going to use this one time right here to talk about the best part
*  of playoff hockey, which is working up a rational, genuine hatred for whoever
*  your opponent is for your favorite team.
*  And I hate the Panthers.
*  They're playing Florida in the second round.
*  The Bruins are down three, two game six is Friday night.
*  Just some, just some highlights of hatred for the Panthers.
*  Nick Cousins, you're the most despised guy in the league.
*  I don't think it took this Bruin series to bring up animosity
*  from a group toward you.
*  You're probably the dirtiest player in the league.
*  And if you were playing in a bigger market, you'd be a bigger deal, but
*  nobody gives a shit about you because you're in Florida.
*  So there's that Montor.
*  You do this thing where you stick your tongue out after being
*  separated by the officials.
*  Honestly, it's lame.
*  You look like a loser.
*  We have all the ability and social media and stuff to just cut this out and,
*  and add different videos and stuff.
*  You just, you suck.
*  Matthew Kachuck, your dad Melrose guy went to modern Catholic.
*  I was living in Massachusetts during that time.
*  He was a Cam Neely type.
*  We all rooted for him.
*  Went to Winnipeg.
*  Good career.
*  He's a great guy.
*  He's a great guy.
*  He's a great guy.
*  Winnipeg good career.
*  I always liked them.
*  It's too bad.
*  His son is the unicrist.
*  He fought Posternak.
*  Posternak doesn't fight.
*  Like it's one of those, like there's certain guys you have on your team.
*  When they get in a fight, you're terrified the whole time because they
*  don't know how to fight.
*  As you can see when pasta is trying to throw a point, he's just missing these
*  wild haymakers lands on the ground.
*  And Kachuck's like trying to basically trying to Kermit Washington as he's on
*  the ground, what a dick.
*  Um, even if you win game six, which you might, I hope you get
*  punched in the handshake line.
*  I don't like you.
*  You would have been an awesome Bruin, but you're on another team and I don't like you.
*  Sam Bennett, the villain of this series for Bruins fans who cheap shot of Marsha
*  who, um, who cheated for the biggest goal of game four.
*  And I hope he gets severe food poisoning tonight before game six.
*  Last but not least Florida fans settle down.
*  You didn't know what hockey was until like 1993.
*  You literally didn't have hockey.
*  You've never won a cup.
*  The average person who follows sports has no idea what city you're attached to.
*  You're the Florida Panthers.
*  Are you in Jacksonville?
*  Are you in Orlando?
*  Are you in Palm beach?
*  Nobody knows.
*  It's the answers Miami, but literally most people don't know that.
*  Uh, you sit there, you're dressed in red.
*  You were in your waving your dumb hankies.
*  You were in your DeSantis, 2026 t-shirts under your jerseys.
*  Nobody knows where the fuck you play.
*  Fuck off.
*  Last but not least, uh, the Panthers in general.
*  I never thought I'd hate a team more than the lightning, but I think I hate you guys more.
*  So that's it.
*  Play off hockey.
*  Really fun to hate another team.
*  It's not rational.
*  Um, but I don't like any of you.
*  Fifth on the, on the six pack, the PGA tournament, they, uh, they finally moved it to may to
*  make it stand out a little bit.
*  So it wasn't the last one.
*  Um, so at least it's not last, but I continue to think it needs its own gimmick because
*  the U S open is like the better version of the PGA tournament.
*  The masters has Augusta and then, you know, the open is in England, Scotland, wherever
*  it is every year.
*  And you know what those three are and the PGA is kind of like, ah, it's the fourth
*  major it's the it's summer slam.
*  So I think the gimmick should be the player should have to carry their own bags.
*  No caddies.
*  I've been pushing for this for 20 years.
*  Nobody listens to me.
*  But if you're talking about the four majors, what's the PGA?
*  Oh, that's the one where they don't have caddies.
*  Ooh, this is going to be tough for tiger.
*  He's old.
*  He's got to carry his own bag.
*  Maybe he'll have less stuff in it.
*  Oh, the younger guys have an advantage because they have to carry their own bag.
*  Oh, watch the guy dumped the bag.
*  Oh, we kind of dumped that bag, right?
*  It's like I was lining up his putt.
*  It was a little bad blood.
*  So many variables of the no caddies carrying your own bag.
*  I just think the PGA would be great.
*  All right.
*  Last but not least basketball, finally.
*  So this Celtics run is historic, but historic is the wrong word because nothing's happened
*  and there's nothing really that special about it.
*  So I was thinking about the phrase historic adjacent.
*  Um, they've had the best, this is just for the last eight years.
*  They've had the best regular season record since the 16, 17 season.
*  They're four 13 and two 23.
*  Only Milwaukee has won 400 games other than that.
*  Milwaukee is four Oh six.
*  So best record last eight years.
*  So best record last eight years.
*  They've made the best trades in draft picks of anyone in the league for almost a decade.
*  Now Tatum faults masterpiece, um, getting Horford back smart, poor Zingas, Derek
*  white drew holiday, not trading Jaylen Brown for Kawhi Leonard, who's played like 45% of
*  his games.
*  They've just done a really nice job putting together the team.
*  They didn't tank like a lot of these other teams, you know, like Minnesota got the
*  number one pick with Anthony Edwards.
*  Um, okay.
*  See shut it down for two years and even a couple of years ago just wouldn't play SGA
*  even though he was one of the best young players in the league.
*  The Celtics really only tanked in 2014.
*  I don't even think it was a tanking.
*  They just weren't that good Tatum and Brown together.
*  They played seven years together.
*  They've won 48 plus games, six of those seven years.
*  They've never had a losing record.
*  They've 12 playoffs series wins.
*  They're 60 and 44 in the postseason together, which is a crazy number.
*  You figure if they stay together five more years, I may play 200
*  playoff games together, but here's the big one.
*  So eight year runs, I went back and I looked at eight year runs.
*  How many times teams made the final four meaning conference finals in the
*  end of the conference.
*  It's not as, it's not as, uh, the Celtics have done six in the last eight, which
*  is just not that common.
*  In fact, it's only happened by math calculations 11 times, uh, since the
*  Russell era Russell won eight straight titles.
*  So he's the leader of that.
*  The Lakers from 80 to 88, they did it eight straight times, five titles.
*  LeBron, I'm just counting him in as his own team because he was in Miami half
*  the time, Cleveland half the time.
*  He made it eight straight times.
*  Three titles, the bird Celtics, 81 to 88, three titles, seven times.
*  The Lakers with Jerry West and then eventually will 66 to 73, seven out of
*  eight, one title, and then there's six teams that did it six times out of eight.
*  The Bulls 91, 98, they won six titles.
*  Golden state 15 to 22.
*  They won four the next, uh, with Willis and those guys, five straight years or
*  six straight years, 69 to 74, two titles.
*  The Pistons with, with, uh, Rick Carlisle first and Larry Brown, they got Rashid in
*  year two, but oh three to Oh eight, six straight times, one title Philly with Doc
*  and eventually Moses six titles.
*  I'm sorry.
*  Six times one title from 77 to 83.
*  And the last team on that list is the Celtics from 17 to 24, um, six times.
*  Zero titles.
*  I mentioned this because all the teams I mentioned won a title except for the
*  Boston Celtics with this current nucleus.
*  So on the one hand, incredible run for them for, uh, you've six final fours in
*  eight years, like anybody would take that, but they've only made the finals once.
*  They've never won a title.
*  And if they don't win the title this time around, then, you know, they become
*  historically adjacent because even if you go to the teams that won five, five out of
*  eight, where they made the final fours, the Spurs and the, in the Duncan era, they
*  won titles Celtics and the Cowan-Tavichek era five out of eight, they won titles.
*  The Lakers from 98 to four, they won three Detroit from 87 to 91.
*  They went to the Pacers in Utah in the nineties are the only two that did five
*  out of eight and didn't win the title.
*  So the Celtics at least historically would go on that list.
*  They would be with like Reggie and the Nick, uh, Reggie and the Pacers.
*  They would be with Malone and Stockton and the Jazz.
*  And the problem for them is there's just not a lot of historical evidence that
*  you could keep going, going, going.
*  And then eventually belatedly win the title.
*  It's usually going to happen at some point during this eight year run.
*  The Lakers with Jerry West probably took it the longest where they, you know, they
*  made the finals a bunch of times they made in 62, they made in 65 from 66 on through
*  73, they made it a few times and they finally won in 72.
*  But that's probably our only example of a team that totaled and totaled and totaled
*  away with the same two best players or the same best player.
*  And it took forever and they finally won.
*  This is the kind of stuff I'm thinking about as we head into round three with
*  the Boston Celtics who have had the easiest path to the finals of any team.
*  I can remember they're going to either play the Knicks or Indiana in the Easter
*  finals, they're going to have home court advantage Indiana had during the
*  headlights in game five, no idea if they're what they're capable of in a round
*  three, but I don't have high expectations.
*  And then the Knicks it's like, Oh, Gio Noby might come back.
*  Uh, if the Celtics can't beat the Knicks without Rando and Mitchell
*  Robertson and Bogdanovich and with OG playing on a hamstring.
*  I said it before, I'll say it again.
*  It would, it would go down as one of, one of the, uh, and I hate the word
*  choke, but it, it would be on that list for Boston teams.
*  It just would.
*  So there you go.
