# Itâ€™s All Falling Apart for the Patriots | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [October 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4QgQQbE2_k)
*  I'm out. I'm completely out. I can I can't come back
*  Mac Jones sits the wind game
*  In Buffalo that they won where he threw like one pass. He's 10 and 12
*  25 TDs 20 interceptions and
*  This is just since Brady left at the end of
*  2019 and we had that Cam Newton season when he couldn't complete a pass that was longer than four yards and then we have this
*  quarterback who just went backwards
*  Basically in eight game intervals to wherever he is now
*  It looked like I don't want to say he gave up but it looked like he was broken
*  By the beginning of third quarter. I was surprised
*  He started the second half because it was like this guy's done
*  This isn't he's not bringing them back and then they brought him back for another one
*  But he's one of the worst five QBs. I watch every week Wow Wow
*  Yeah, that's saying a lot. Hey, that is saying a lot. Do you not agree terrible ones?
*  Wait, they haven't gotten at 20 points in four games. I think he's wrong. I'm not gonna
*  Get up here and then make a big deal out of Mac Jones being great. That's for sure
*  But I don't know that I could separate him from that mess that we watch in those 1 p.m. Eastern kickoffs. That's for sure. But
*  honestly
*  You look at him. Blow your eyes. Look at the New England receiving
*  A
*  Quartet or whatever more these these names are just awful and they don't get separation and they're not open
*  They're not ever open and Mac Jones is what he is
*  But by the way, nobody ever said you should have the best quarterback in all of football every day your life
*  My whole life after 30 years old, you know, and and here's another little secret
*  I think your coach sucks a little bit. I really do. I think that's the discussion that's gonna start this week about
*  Here's I think Patriots fans do everything they can to blame everyone else but Belichick and I get it
*  I know why I know why because you're holding on to the past and everything else
*  But he is really I think the game has passed him by he surrounds himself with losers basically
*  But on purpose so that when they go on to fail, he looks better
*  I just don't know what and it doesn't work anymore because he doesn't have Tom Brady. I
*  Didn't want him to go down like this
*  I was texting somebody tonight about how it's like if Seinfeld had just kept going past the 10th season like six more seasons
*  And Julia Louis Dreyfus left and they replaced her with like Margaret show and then Michael Richards left
*  alright, and they replaced him with like Doug Stanhope and
*  And it just if it's just hey, it's still Seinfeld
*  But it's like now this isn't Seinfeld anymore and the writing just got worse and worse and worse
*  right and people right now, it's still Seinfeld it's gonna come back and
*  It's just not gonna come back and we're now four years since Brady and that last Brady season wasn't fun either but I
*  Can't really refute the Belichick stuff. The team is so sloppy
*  They do the dumbest things at the worst possible times. They have terrible turnovers. They don't protect the ball
*  The game from a game plan standpoint. I don't understand why we weren't running the ball down your throats
*  Why max even that evolved and I just can't remember the last time I watched a crispy
*  Crispily coach Patriots game and he's got what two family members on his staff, right?
*  It's the NFL. It's like aren't why aren't you getting the best coaches? I hate the nepotism thing
*  I hate you know, I hate that thing. I think he's gonna have been for a real tough week this week because this is like rock bottom
*  for this
*  Franchise post Brady they're one in three and if you look at the schedule, it's hard to imagine them getting six
*  I thought they were gonna cover and possibly win today because their defense had been that good
*  But then Gonzalez gets hurt. I'm not sure when he's coming back. Judon's out for at least three months
*  Those were the two best parts in the defense. So you look at that and then you look at an offense that can't score
*  It's an inspiring step that seems like it's a step behind. I I was thinking like I
*  Wrote down the bleakest AFC team in this I wrote down before the Jets game
*  It's Vegas the Jets Denver and the Pats now you would take the Jets off at least there's like signs. I hope
*  Denver is a mess
*  Vegas what are like the Pats might have the bleakest future in the AFC
*  They're gonna go like like do we tank? What do we do? I think eventually you're gonna get angry and angrier with Belichick
*  I think it's gonna be evident that I can't get angry. No, you will you make fun of fantasy
*  But you're probably about six weeks away from tweeting the same thing
*  I can't. Belichick is a supergoal. Or Ben is gonna get on your Twitter somehow and he is gonna he's gonna
*  Tweet that the Belichick is a little... Listen when when James Babydoll-Dixon lost his fastball
*  We stayed with him. We didn't turn on him. Like we accepted this situation for what it is
*  Like when he started vacationing 20-25 weeks a year
*  Yeah, did we did we turn on him? No, we still love him. We still love him
*  We make fun of him though. We still let him like get involved in our business from time to time
*  But it's true. We didn't give up on him. Like we had too many good... He did too many good things for us
*  You're right. You're right. I don't know. Yeah, they kind of have the same personality too. So I know what you're saying. Yeah
*  One in the same
*  Well here I wrote this down
*  Zach Wilson for Mac Jones question mark. Ooh, which team says no faster?
*  After tonight. No, seriously if you're the Jets, would you would you take back Jones for Zack Wilson like five days ago?
*  You would have but right now do what do you do? I was gonna do this to you with with Josh Dobbs
*  But I guess I would take Josh. I would throw it a third round pick with back. Would you really?
*  Wow, you have solid. Oh, I Mac needs to go. It's just gonna get worse
*  12-21
*  Yeah
*  Strip sack fumble strip sack fumble for a touchdown to
*  A strip sound too. Oh man. It was all so much fun. I listen believe me
*  I think about this too and when drew holiday sign today, I was like, oh shit if the Cowboys blow out the Patriots
*  I lose Simmons. It's October 1st and I already lost them for the year
*  He's not gonna like football and then I'm like, I don't care. It'll be fun to blow him out
*  But I was looking at how long we've been doing this
*  Yeah, 17 or 15 15 17 years 17 years so the Cowboys have played the Patriots
*  1 2 3 4 6 times in that span 0 7 48 27 you win 11
*  2016 you win 15 30 to 6 you win
*  19 13 to 9 you win
*  21 we beat you in overtime 35 29 didn't even feel like a win. It was just a relief and then today
*  Let me have one of these once in a while. Come on
*  Break over 15 years
*  Thank you. Here's here's what I have
*  Here's why I got really sad about that because today started out great the drew holiday trade drops out of nowhere
*  Watching the London game watching you guys on wise guys all the sudden we get true holiday. It's like this a great day
*  I put down a couple more bets. I'm like, this is my day
*  I go on five and million dollar picks the check era ends and I got really sad for
*  Like five minutes and then then I went
*  And I'm like, you know what I have the DVDs
*  The six titles by the blue rays and the DVDs. I have that I have
*  I have like books that were written about the pats like Seth Wickersham better to be feared. There's this bell check autobiography. I
*  have
*  This this page two column that somebody printed out and Tom Brady autographed
*  Mm-hmm
*  This is what I have now the memorabilia
*  From a really nice run that's now over. You know what? That's what losers do they reminisce they sit home and yes
*  Yeah, what's the lowest form of conversation is remember when welcome to the Patriots nation?
*  Tony Soprano said that right? Yeah, Tony Soprano said that to Paul. Yeah, that's right
*  You
