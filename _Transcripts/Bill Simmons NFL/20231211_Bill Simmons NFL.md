# Are Dak and Purdy Neck and Neck in the NFL MVP Race? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [December 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBQOfbhkKqQ)
*  I had an unbelievable day. We'll talk about that later.
*  Sal had an even better day.
*  He pulled the Eagles Albatross.
*  He just, he pulled it off the back of his back.
*  He whipped it down.
*  He stomped on it.
*  He pulled it in Big Dom.
*  What a great night.
*  You have a field goal kicker.
*  You're probably the number two favorite to win the Super Bowl.
*  I can't say enough good things.
*  And you look like a pig in shit right now.
*  Thank you. I think.
*  I vowed that Big Dom was not going to be the most obese Italian
*  who had a good Sunday night.
*  And I was right. It was me.
*  It was me after all.
*  I classic beat down Simmons.
*  And I promised last week I wouldn't make a big deal out of it if this occurred.
*  And I lied because I like everything about this, honestly,
*  except for the calendar.
*  That's the only thing I don't like that I say.
*  I wish this was January and we could get it going,
*  because momentum is such a big deal.
*  Yeah, I can't even figure out how somebody would shit on this other than to say...
*  I mean, there's going to be a point.
*  It will be made on the talk shows tomorrow.
*  Was...
*  Did this game say more about where the Eagles are than where the Cowboys are?
*  Because their defense was so bad.
*  You know, they give up the six touchdowns in a row to the Niners.
*  They come into this game.
*  You go touchdown, field goal, touchdown, touchdown, first half.
*  And for some reason, Collinsworth was making it seem like the Eagles were going to come back.
*  It was a really weird...
*  I felt like the game was over almost immediately.
*  By the time we were headed toward the second quarter,
*  I was like, they're not going to be able to stop you all game.
*  I think the fall of the Eagles defense over this last four weeks
*  has been shocking because we thought at the very least they were going to be able to
*  push, push, push constantly.
*  They had the solid secondary.
*  And now it just seems like anybody can move the ball up and down the field on them.
*  Yes, unless they're playing possum,
*  unless they're doing exactly what I'm worried about.
*  They're laying back a little and say, all right, we still control our own destiny.
*  We got a cupcake schedule coming up.
*  We're not going to lose to the Giants either of the two times or the Cardinals.
*  Seattle's kind of beat up.
*  But I don't think that's what's going on.
*  But yeah, I definitely like what I'm saying here.
*  I mean, I would normally be terrified on that fumble six
*  as a return for a touchdown.
*  But I was like, we still have this in hand.
*  We've punted once since Thanksgiving.
*  This is a great day. That kicker, that Brandon Aubrey,
*  he's like effortless kicks.
*  It looks like he's using 60 percent of his leg.
*  He's like just meeting.
*  I know he's going to miss three extra points in the wild card round game in January.
*  He's going to kick it into the cheerleader section.
*  But it really looks like his boot is loaded like they might check the iron sheik
*  for a loaded boot. It's amazing what's going on.
*  Yeah, they're bored field goal kicks.
*  He's like, all right, I'll kick another 58 yarder.
*  He's like, I don't want to get hurt.
*  I'll do a couple for your friends.
*  So many good storylines from Dallas being in here.
*  We could start with Dak, who I think is officially in the MVP combo.
*  Although Purdy's got it's got to be at least co favorites.
*  I refuse to put Purdy over Dak or vice versa.
*  Purdy was awesome today.
*  Purdy, he was six for six on balls 16 plus yards today.
*  He's he's turned into they keep comparing him to Kurt Warner.
*  And there's a reason for it because he looks like 1999 Kurt Warner.
*  And it is the same body.
*  But he's just throwing lasers all over the field.
*  And I don't think I don't think Dak's been better than him.
*  Well, I know.
*  And it's not like Dak doesn't have a great supporting cast
*  a lot on defense, too.
*  But it isn't everyone who likes Purdy now three weeks ago
*  is crying for McCaffrey to be MVP.
*  And Debo Samuel has been phenomenal.
*  I mean, that reboot is crazy.
*  Every time he touches the ball, it looks like there's no way
*  going to get within 10 yards of him.
*  So I don't know how it could be all these things.
*  Dak is plus 150. I'm just saying it's even.
*  Yeah, I think that's I think that's fair.
*  I saw on Twitter Trent Williams,
*  who I had no idea is one of the great orders of our time.
*  He had like a five minute response to a question about Brock Purdy
*  after the game today.
*  And in five minutes, he won me over completely.
*  He was like so disdainful of people who are like, oh, it's all the weapons.
*  It's not what Purdy's doing.
*  And he just kind of like calmly picked it apart.
*  It was like the best interview I've seen all year.
*  I thought it was great. Did you see it was great?
*  I did. I did. It was the postgame interview.
*  Yeah. Yeah, it's fine.
*  I just I didn't like the subject matter.
*  I think he's wrong about it.
*  Listen, I'm saying is Dak first Purdy, I think is where we are.
*  I think Hertz is falling back.
*  Lamar is kind of lingering, but even today, I know they they won.
*  He had the fourth quarter drive, but he wasn't like amazing in that game.
*  And Vandal has it Prescott 150, Purdy 200 and then to Lamar and Hertz at eight to one.
*  Yeah, I think that's fair.
*  And Tyree could have 200 yards tomorrow night and whip himself
*  into that. So we have the Dak thing, which you've been through,
*  I would say a fair amount with Dak over the years.
*  Yeah, I would say it's been a little bit of a rollercoaster ride.
*  But he's in right when it feels perfect.
*  Then, of course, he gets strip sack and they get a pick six.
*  And it's like just they just had to sprinkle a little little little dust on it.
*  But yeah, I'm at the rollercoaster.
*  I'm at the part of the rollercoaster ride where I'm not quite ready to vomit.
*  But it's coming up.
*  I know it's like three weeks on the downfall.
*  So we have that.
*  We have for the first time.
*  I think since we do done this podcast,
*  where I don't think Dallas has been a top two team in the league this late in this season.
*  Like we have we have the holidays in two weeks.
*  And it got me thinking like all the just what would happen?
*  The Super Bowls in Vegas.
*  If Dallas could somehow get there, what is Jerry Jones going to be like
*  over these next four weeks, five weeks, six weeks?
*  Does he do something dumb?
*  Does he embrace it?
*  I don't know. There's just a lot of storylines.
*  Plus, you have like that you have the Stefan Gilmore, the amazing resurgence of him.
*  You have Parsons, you have C.D.
*  Lamb. He's kind of moving into the best receiver conversation a little bit.
*  But there's a lot of fun.
*  And then McCarthy, who was coaching, they have no appendix.
*  What a hero. Right.
*  No appendix. We were worried all his coaching ability was in the appendix.
*  And now that that's gone, we had no idea what to expect today.
*  But yeah, I listen, honestly, when you say they're top two team,
*  I assume you're putting the 49ers at number one, but they're still like 25 points
*  better than the Cowboys and the Eagles.
*  So I can't get too excited about the Vegas Super Bowl.
*  They're still in the NFC. So it's tough.
*  The AFC, I have no idea who the best team, but good luck.
*  Well, one of the great things for you is, let's say somehow you get the NFC.
*  You'd be the two seed unless the Niner or something weird happens.
*  But you'll be playing a soon to be awful seven seed in the NFC.
*  Right. If you end up the five seed and you're playing the worst
*  champion, the division.
*  So, yeah, yeah, that team is going to be terrible, too.
*  So you at least know that round one, you're probably going to be favored
*  by between eight to eleven points.
*  So I think you're in a nice spot.
*  Warren Sharp, our friend who's on the Friday podcast with House,
*  who helped me out, by the way, with with my fan duel, same game parlay.
*  That was 13 to 1 when I made it, but it hit at 11, one today.
*  I was he was like he was pro James Cook.
*  James Cook was a beast. So thank you, Warren Sharp.
*  But he had a tweet.
*  The Cowboys have scored 17 plus first half points in seven straight games.
*  Yeah. Only one other team in the last 60 years has accomplished that feat.
*  The 2007 Patriots.
*  That's not nothing. Yeah.
*  Seven straight.
*  Yeah. Well, we made it to the Super Bowl.
*  We had the lead with two minutes to go.
*  We had five Giants had to hold on the on the helmet
*  catch to prevent us from winning the Super Bowl.
*  That's fine.
*  No, it's great. Honestly, you said I've been through a lot with this team.
*  And there were years where we'd go 11 games without scoring a touchdown
*  on the or a point on the first drive or first, you know, most of the first quarter.
*  I don't like your demeanor. I don't like your demeanor right now.
*  I know. I know. You're throwing water.
*  You're throwing water on.
*  I just I know what you're up to.
*  You're trying not to be too excited, but deep down, I know you had 40 text today
*  where you were having fucking orgasms all over the more than that.
*  Just admit it. Just admit you're orgasmic right now.
*  OK, I'm orgasmic, but we're still going to get a five seed.
*  I mean, I don't see any way around it. I don't see it.
