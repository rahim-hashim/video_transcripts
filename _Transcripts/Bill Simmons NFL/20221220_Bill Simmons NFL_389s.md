# Is It Time for Bill Belichick to Retire From Coaching? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [December 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kYuvffA7Wk)
*  Kyle, turn the TikTok camera on. Sadly. Oh, there it is.
*  It's time. Belichick needs to retire. Oh no. Yeah, he does.
*  He needs to retire. And I actually went back. I wrote this column in 2006 after that Bill Parcell
*  season when, uh, when the Cowboys lost and Parcells, remember he just kind of lost it and it was kind
*  of sad. And I was like, man, remember Parcells when Parcells was an awesome coach. And now it
*  just looks like he's taking paychecks and he's out of it and you're doing dumb stuff and it's
*  uncharacteristic and the game management's bad. And this, I had this speed limit corollary where
*  it was like after coaches turned 55, it starts to get dicey. And I went through all the history
*  and pointed out all these different examples. Now people are coaching when they're a little bit
*  older. Him and Pete Carroll, the oldest coaches in the league, they're both, uh, Belichick is 69 and
*  Carroll 70. The third oldest is Andy Reed who's 64 and Loving Smith 64. But for the most part,
*  once you get in the sixties, it's pretty unusual. But then you think back to like, remember Tom
*  Landry when he got old, how old was he when they, when they let him go? He was only, only 64. I
*  thought you were going to say 37. But remember those last few years, it was like, oh man, Landry's so old. He's just lost it.
*  He's five years younger than Belichick. Um, Shula, same thing. It's like, oh man, this is kind of sad,
*  Don Shula. It's ending this way. He was 65. Parcell's that 2006 example. I gave you, he was 62.
*  It's like, our dads are in our seventies, right? I'm not, they're not throwing a hundred miles an hour
*  anymore. Our dads, how old's your dad? Uh, he's 82, but listen, this is nonsense because you know,
*  some guys get a break, right? Brady, well, that's maybe not a good example after today, but Brady
*  shouldn't be in the league last year or the year before the year before that. You almost have to add
*  10 years to Brady's longevity and Belichick's longevity. And they, they're going to have...
*  I added the 10 years. Now he's going to be 70 next year. Okay. But he can't, he's not going out on this note.
*  He's going to, he's going to win two of the next three and you're going to fall just short of making
*  the playoffs, right? I would much rather see him retire. Right now? Have four more years. No, after
*  the season. Then watch this for four more years because the thing about this Patriots season,
*  this is not a Patriots team. This is a team that fucks up every quarter over and over and over again,
*  delay games, stupid penalties, dumb decisions, bad game management. They never would have blown a game
*  like this 10 years ago. And at some point I look, I don't really blame him as much as the coaching
*  staff he's assembled. There's no coach on that coaching staff that's getting poached. None, zero.
*  So he's getting older and then he doesn't have that reservoir of these awesome guys who someday
*  they're going to be Brian Flores or McDaniels or whoever. And the team is just sloppy. They're
*  disjointed. Their offense sucks. They do dumb shit game after game. And I tweeted today,
*  the, the announcer at one point, he was like, man, you, it's hard to get used to seeing this from the
*  Patriots. And it's like, it's actually really easy to get used to it. I've been watching it for over
*  three months now. So really sloppy team. And that goes to the coach. If this was a normal coach,
*  any other person, we'd be like, man, like Ron Rivera today, Washington was terribly coached
*  today. It was like, oh yeah, of course it's Ron Rivera. Belichick's the greatest coach of all time.
*  I just, I don't want to see him go out like this. So. All right. But because he's the greatest coach
*  of all time, he probably feels he should have the most wins out of any coach ever. Right. So he's 20
*  behind Shula. And so, all right, even if he doesn't think that they can win a Superbowl, the Patriots,
*  I think he thinks he could scratch together seven wins a year for the next three years.
*  Right. And that puts him over. I bet that means a ton to him to have the most wins.
*  This is the greatest. This is the greatest coach of all time.
*  People still say it's Shula. People still say it's Shula. And by the way, I think you're right.
*  Most guys aren't going to be coaching at 75 anymore. And so that if he gets this 348 wins,
*  that's almost insurmountable at this point. I just find it hard to believe having studied
*  this guy and watch him and followed him and read the different books and watch the documentaries
*  about him and all this stuff. He cares so much about his place in history that I don't see him
*  doing the thing where he just like, first of all, this is year three now of depressing whatever,
*  like Brady's last year, the Cam Newton actually, actually it's year four Brady's last year. That
*  was awful. Even though they made the playoffs, the Cam Newton year last year, they get annihilated in
*  the playoffs. And then this year they're not even going to make the playoffs. That's four years now.
*  That's a presidential term. So I don't, what are the, what happens is what a lot of teams and a lot
*  of fan bases go through. I'm sorry, Bill. And I, and I know that I'm just looking at him historically,
*  why would he want to keep doing this? So he's going to go nine and eight.
*  Then next year he'll go seven and 10. It's like, Oh, now I'm 14 away. Like you're the greatest
*  coach ever. Go out, go out on a high note. This is not high. It's going to piss you off. If he gets
*  that record with the Texans, you know, you're going to be upset. Although that'll probably take
*  like nine years, but you know, that'll upset you. I think there's a chance this could be his last
*  year with the Patriots because I don't think craft is up for this interest. And I don't know
*  what's going on with those guys, but you know, it's Wickersham's done some awesome reporting on this
*  that I doubted at first and he was right. But the, the Brady piece of this and how that got screwed
*  up. And then you watch this team, the Patricia thing is these most inexplicable thing in the
*  history of the Belichick era. The fact that they have this guy who has no business as an offensive
*  coordinator, calling the fucking plays week after week. And he's awful every week. Everybody's worse.
*  There's not one person who's in a better spot because Matt Patricia is the offensive coordinator.
*  It's like, if like you're our cousin, Jimmy, if he just made fucking Guillermo, the head writer,
*  and he'd be like, ah, yeah, Guillermo knows everybody and he, you know,
*  Jimmy's comfortable with them. And then the show goes in the fucking tank.
*  After a while, it'd be like, man, maybe Guillermo shouldn't be the head writer.
*  Right. That's not in the tank. You still can make the playoffs.
*  This game should host the Oscars. I think that's what you're saying.
