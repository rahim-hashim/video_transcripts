# Some Crazy “My Guy” Fantasy Football Draft Categories | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [August 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDscHxqAr3c)
*  My sorry, that's too rich for my blood guy. Who is it for you Craig?
*  It's Christian McCaffrey. Ah, I
*  I just I don't like dealing with Niners running backs Shanahan running backs
*  Don't mix with me people think that that McCaffrey is getting the Panthers role in San Francisco
*  But the reality is is one they want to keep him healthy throughout the whole year
*  And when Eli Mitchell who's a really good backup on the team when he was healthy last year him and McCaffrey split carries pretty much
*  50-50 so I actually think McCaffrey going number one overall and you dropping $60 on him is
*  Is not a smart decision for all we know Jordan Mason's gonna be getting goal line work for the Niners. I
*  Love it, and he was my backup choice
*  But I'm going with a guy who came up earlier in this podcast Tony Pollard. No
*  Oh
*  Yeah, you know why cuz you guys are all in on Tony Pollard. It's all happening. It's all that's fair
*  I think he's gonna go for like $62 two people are gonna be
*  They're gonna listen to this pot other ones and get all excited about him and guess what?
*  Maybe Tony Pollard was great in a limited role. Maybe he was McConaughey and wolf of Wall Street
*  Maybe you didn't want three hours of McConaughey in that movie
*  Maybe it was nice just to have him pop in for a nice section and then leave
*  Power comes in and out is in the perfect situation
*  Way more explosive than Zeke. Do we know if he can get 300 plus carries?
*  Do we know if he can be the goal line back? I don't know. I'm not gonna spend $62 to find out
*  So he's my guy. You got DK
*  I'm going with Bruce Hall for the Jets. Yeah, that's a great pick. I mean he's been in my opinion
*  I've been trying to tell these guys all offseason that he's just a little too highly priced right now
*  Just based on the fact number one, he's coming off an ACL which you know, he might be fine
*  He might do you know, he might be spectacular and whatever and like he won't have any ill effects from this ACL
*  But there's also a strong chance that he has other
*  Compensatory injuries around that injury or whatever and I don't want to have to again
*  I don't want to have to worry about him being hurt every single week
*  And then the other thing is obviously they signed Alvin Cook, which is even it's an even bigger reason, you know
*  it sounds like
*  Coming from the Jets that Aaron Rodgers was really, you know trying to get this to happen. He apparently loves Alvin Cook
*  There's a chance he lobbies and gets Alvin Cook more playing time
*  There's a chance Alvin Cook is just straight up the starter on this offense
*  And so there's just too many variables going on here. I think Brice Hall is awesome
*  I think he's an awesome player and you know, he could end up making me look bad for that
*  But I just there's too many variables and I'm just shying away from that every single time I go into a draft
*  I'm just like there's too many things going on there
*  Let's ask somebody who has recent experience with rooting for a team whose star running back
*  Tore in ACL and then came back like year one after the injury of Saquon
*  Was not remotely like year two after the injury Saquon, right Danny
*  No, not at all
*  and so a sequence is a little different because he had I think an ACL and a meniscus and basically what that does is delay you being
*  able to have the surgery and the recovery afterward and that's why Brice Hall's was considered quote like cleaner because
*  Javante Williams when you have multiple stuff, there's all these variables having said that
*  Everyone's like well, Adrian Peterson came back from an ACL and he was that was ten years ago
*  We don't have a second example yet
*  like at some point like why don't we just stop trying to bet on outliers and like just
*  All these other players like there's so many running backs slimmer to Brice Hall and also again just like earlier
*  Lombardi made that great point about Arthur Smith is trying to tell us the cow pit says
*  When the Jets go out of their way to pay seven million dollars to bring in Dalvin Cook
*  Listen to them, right? Yeah, who do you have for this category? I have this
*  Cooper Cup man. I hate saying but you got you want Cooper Cup
*  You got to pay 55 bucks basically a quarter of your budget or a first-round pick and I look when I'm going to like click that
*  button I
*  Think people are missing the force for the trees
*  If you just look at per game last year Cooper Cup per game was the number one receiver in fantasy when he went down
*  The percentage of the passing game he has that the Rams is historically great and everyone's like well, he's so much better
*  I think it was missing the force of the trees if he gets hurt
*  Are the Rams really gonna like are the rims really gonna do they want to win this year?
*  The Rams want Caleb Williams the prospect of the Rams shutting down Stafford who debated retiring this year or Stafford getting hurt
*  And the Rams just saying you know what Cooper Cup you have a hamstring injury. We're gonna shut you down
*  It's so much
*  disproportionately more important for Cooper Cup to
*  Play for you in December in the fantasy playoffs is so much more important than the marginal gains
*  He has over like Jamar chase or Tyree kill that I'm like why am I risking like all these other guys?
*  I don't have to ask whether their team wants them to play in the final weeks of the season my I wouldn't take him
*  Even if he was free guy
*  aka the DND list
*  DK who do you got who's on your DND list? Who's your number one?
*  So Craig's gonna be mad at me about this, but it's camp makers for the Rams. I'm just I'm just off
*  I'm off that train. I there was a point in time in my life when I really liked cam makers
*  But there's just so many reasons for me to fade him this year, you know
*  Even past like the whole like personality thing where he trying to kind of quit on the team last year
*  He was like away from the team for a while they recap like him and Sean McVay rekindled their relationship
*  I don't know what the hell happened there, but like just past that
*  I think the Rams are gonna have to pass a lot this year because their defense isn't gonna be very good
*  They're gonna be playing from behind they have like 30 undrafted free agents on their roster and
*  I don't know to me. It's just that's a little bit worrisome
*  I think they're probably gonna be they're gonna have to lean on the past a little bit more
*  I think Kyron Williams is gonna be the guy that they leaned in that
*  Lean on for that in terms of their running backs
*  And so I don't know just there's just too many red flags with with him
*  And then he's also a guy who came off of the Achilles so, you know not to steal from another category
*  But it's like as soon as the red flag soon as the red cross pops up next to his name
*  I'm just gonna be worried the rest of the season on him
*  I just don't want to have to deal with it and there was some weird chemistry stuff with him and McVay last year too
*  Which they sorted out but there was three weeks there where he was available for basically anything. Who do you got Heifetz? I
*  Don't want to Sean Watson on my team this year man
*  I
*  Financially football is supposed to be fun and I'm gonna be staring at my TV and I'm gonna be like rooting for to Sean Watson
*  I'm like, I don't want this dude on my team this year
*  Especially like if you're gonna sell your soul at least make sure the person's freaking good
*  It's like the idea of to Sean Watson being bad and on your team
*  I can't imagine a worse feeling of like ruining your entire like four-month fantasy season
*  I'm like there are more quarterbacks now that are good in the NFL than maybe at any point in NFL stream
*  Like just take anyone else anyone. It's fine. I
*  Like that pick who do you got Craig? I
*  Wouldn't accept money from Michael Pittman this year. I don't want anything to do with that was your number one guy last year
*  That was that was your the pendulum. You're my true love last year
*  Yeah, it was it didn't exactly work out not exactly his fault
*  I still think he's a good player
*  But I just I don't love what Anthony Richardson on the ground is maybe the best running quarterback
*  We've ever seen through the area might be the worst and I don't like anything
*  I've seen in the preseason from Richardson passing this offense on the Colts this year feels like the Bears last year
*  It's gonna be like running the Navy offense. Yeah, I don't want anything to do with Michael Pittman. He's way too expensive
*  Also, you didn't mention this piece with Pittman. I mean not not the most durable guy
*  And Richardson has a couple of those throws like I'm wide open over the middle now
*  I'm jumping reaching for the pass that's over my head and I'm getting blasted by safety stay away
*  Yeah, so I really wanted to take Jonathan Taylor here
*  But there is the McCaffrey
*  2022 trade possibility where all of a sudden he's on some awesome team and somebody has him for 19 bucks in fears
*  So I'm not taking him. So I was really proud of this pick. It's Kadiah Tony
*  There's three outcomes for a fantasy receiver like Kadiah Tony, right?
*  One is he just never lives up to the hype and it's just super disappointing and you just regret that you take him
*  The second is that it's amazing and it actually works out and he plays
*  16 weeks including the playoffs when you need him those last three and it's just you struck oil you hit a home run
*  and then there's the third one, which is the worst which is
*  The guy who tempts you he tantalizes you
*  With two or three weeks where he has like in week four
*  He has six catches for 190 yards and three TDs. You're like, oh my god. I did it
*  I fucking landed on the moon with Kadiah Tony and then in week seven the red flags up and
*  Then it's like he he missed an injury rehab session. He's been suspended by the team for
*  72 hours and then he misses week eight and then there's another injury and then now he's just hogging my roster spot because I have
*  No idea if he's gonna come back or not
*  But he was the guy that had 190 yards in week three. So I have to hold on. I don't want it. I'm out
*  I'm just out. I don't want to deal with it
*  I still dream about I I still dream about his game against Dallas in 2020
*  I believe it was week four. He had like 150 yards
*  I've ever seen in my life that one game game and I still hope to get there one day
*  You know what Tony could there is Tony's a drug
*  He's kind of like Salvia distorts time because Craig and DK talk about cadet Tony's greatness like Michael Thomas's greatness except it
*  You know Salvi, it's like ten minutes. It feels like three hours. I'm like dude
*  He had two good games like two years ago and I've just I I I'm completely he was also like the third most
*  Important player on the Chiefs in the Super Bowl mind you and
*  The Chiefs played him for like five steps in the game
*  He was they had two weeks to prep him for the game. Oh my don't even get me started
*  You know what? He'll what he's the new Josh Gordon
*  I mean different different issues, but he's just so tantalizing and teams talked themselves into him and you just I just don't trust it
*  I don't believe it Josh Gordon, but he's allowed to play but he's just right anyway
*  This cat this category is called I wouldn't take him even if he was free
*  He practically is you can get him for a dollar or two who cares. It's worth a flyer, but hey, it's a gateway drug
*  This is the problem with the Chiefs DK as I look at them big picture because I talked about this little Mardin on Sunday
*  but I picked them in the Super Bowl last year and the theory was
*  Their receivers are just good enough and my homes is so great and their offensive line is gonna be good that he'll make it work
*  But now I feel like we've passed the point and overturned to the to the degree that if they don't hit with Tony
*  Or one of their rookies doesn't actually like blossom into a major major dude
*  Who's catching the ball other than Kelsey? I cannot figure it out. Who's there? What receiver do you trust the most on the Chiefs?
*  Probably sky more but yeah, we haven't really seen him yet
*  Yeah, he lined up wrong in the Super Bowl and still caught a touchdown
*  But to me yeah, I think so the curious Tony thing is more of a bit than us being actually serious
*  But he I will say the way he moves is very totally a bit
*  He's he does he has rare you watch him play is like alright this guy's pretty special
*  And I was on the sideline. I think the one thing that
*  The one actual analytical thing I will say about him is I think he's good on the scramble plays on the broken plays when my
*  Homes gets outside of pocket extends plays and that's really a huge part of my homes his game
*  Tony's always seems to be in the right place when those plays happen
*  maybe it's because he's in the wrong place where he was supposed to be running but
*  To me that's the one like actual analytical thing
*  I would say other than he moves differently than everyone else on the field is that's what gets me excited about it
*  So I got me you know what fantasy football is enough pain and heartache and self-doubt and hating yourself
*  I don't need to also bring cadareus Tony into that
*  I don't need to be tantalized by this talented dude my I'd never root for an injury, but he is one injury away guy
*  There's two that jumped out of me
*  I'll let Craig have the other one Tajay Spears. Oh, I'm still in yeah
*  Mmm, just electric did it in college
*  There's like this whole Emmett Smith
*  Possibility with him where it's like all the evidence was there all along we just didn't look
*  there's some change of pace stuff with Henry this could be the year Henry goes south, but
*  You take Spears you take Henry and you take Spears is probably the move
*  But you could just take Spears and then the guy who has Henry is pissed off that you took
*  Fucking a you spent seven dollars on Spears you news by backup, but then in like week six
*  He's just crushing it so that is my guy who do you have DK?
*  Well, I had Spears, but since you took him I'm gonna go Sam Darnold
*  I'm half kidding, but not really like there's some there's some Shanahan loves him buzz. That's definitely percolating I
*  Can't do it after he blew the 21 nothing lead to Tampa in the last week of the season
*  I could never go back. Who do you have?
*  Well, this is real synergy because the guys have written down our Jalen Warren who I'm sure Craig is gonna say and I have
*  Tasha Spears and I have Sam Darnold. I can't believe I am Arnold. Yeah, I will use this moment to say I
*  Nothing should go wrong with Brock Bird. I wish nothing a little bottom. Of course, however
*  People really overlooked the whole undefeated thing happened in line with Christian McCaffrey started games with them number one two
*  What can what can Brock Birdie do the same?
*  Don't we can't do like the whole problem Sam Darnold was basically his brain and that he was coached by Adam Gase to enter
*  the NFL and I can't think of a wider gap between coaching the bad habits out of you than Adam Gase and
*  Kyle Shanahan I
*  I think the Brock Birdie chapter will be very funny and honestly
*  I think the diners might win the Super Bowl if Darnold wins the job. Oh my gosh. Wow, Craig
*  You want to just end it here? I don't want to do Jalen Warren because I don't want Najee to get hurt
*  I don't want to I don't want to speak that into existence. I like Najee Harris. I think they're a good one-two punch
*  I don't want to do that. You know, I want to give it to
*  Brandon I you kind of 49ers
*  Brandon I you needs to put a couple banana peels on the field for Kittles McCaffrey and Debo because
*  We've been waiting for this guy to blow up and he almost does it
*  He has a few spike weeks like whenever one of those other guys gets hurt Brandon I you kiss a great game
*  We need to get a couple of those guys out of here because I've been hearing how I you cuz one of the best receivers
*  In the league for three years now
*  That's a really good one. Well, I guess technically nobody took Jalen Warren, but we all had him that that's one where
*  That's the he's the new Tony powered is really what he is
*  We're just he's kind of Tony powered and waiting for the moment. This day was realized they had an opportunity happens
*  Najee Harris, it should probably sleep with one eye open
*  It's a good thing
