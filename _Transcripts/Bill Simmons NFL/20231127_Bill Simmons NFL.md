# Can the Pats Get Another Tom Brady? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [November 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDwzU97yWuk)
*  All right, Sal. So February 2002,
*  Adam Vinatieri, after previously making a couple of weeks earlier,
*  the greatest kick in Patriots history in the snow against the Raiders,
*  then he made it again to win.
*  And then he makes the winning kick in Super Bowl 36 and goes down as an icon.
*  21 years later, my guy Chad Rylan comes in.
*  It's 10-7 Giants, 35 yarders,
*  sending the game in in overtime nobody wanted.
*  And Chad said, you know what?
*  I'm going to hook this one left, sends it left, puts the Pats into the top two
*  with an outside chance to get the first pick in the 2023 draft.
*  They are probably not going to win another game this season.
*  I would I would say it's a safe bet.
*  I don't know if Fando has odds on it, but they're going to be prohibitive
*  underdogs, I think, in all the games, except for the Jets game.
*  They play home chargers next week at Pittsburgh,
*  home Casey at Denver, at Buffalo and then home against the Jets.
*  The last week were Aaron Rodgers.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Ever coming back.
*  But but this was both the nadir
*  and the apex of the 2023 season south because we needed the loss.
*  It's a weird situation against your team.
*  I know you hated it.
*  I do hate it. I do, because this is a rivalry.
*  Jets, Giants, Patriots is a rivalry.
*  You should never root for the other team.
*  You should never be rooting for Tommy DeVito on the other side
*  to put you out of your misery and vault you up these.
*  I don't know what kind of chart you like.
*  You even know who you're going to draft like, oh, Marvin Harrison Jr.
*  All right, Marvin Harris.
*  There could be three receivers down in the bottom half of the first round
*  that are as good as Marvin Harrison Jr.
*  You just don't know it yet.
*  And you've made your decision.
*  You're not going to root for Bill Belichick to break the record as a patriot.
*  Guy who's done so much for you and everything else.
*  You're now rooting for losses.
*  That's what I don't like.
*  Well, I think he's also rooting for losses because what other explanation
*  was there to play back Jones?
*  No way. Belichick did the classic.
*  He split the snaps with the guy all week.
*  He left everybody in the dark for who the starter was going to be.
*  He get he made it as tenuous as possible for Mac.
*  He did everything possible to completely undermine his confidence.
*  And guess what happened?
*  Mac, who was already a shell of himself, went out and played his worst game yet,
*  which didn't seem possible.
*  You said Zappi's worse.
*  You said it on text.
*  Text you like he Zappi might be worse.
*  So his hands are tied.
*  Like, I don't know what he's not trying to lose.
*  That kickers not trying to lose.
*  It's a fun joke to make.
*  Like, oh, Kraft was on the phone.
*  He made it. You know, he put in the call and that's it.
*  Kick a miss by three feet in hook it, you know, into the right corner of the end.
*  The glorious three feet.
*  I actually think you could you could argue.
*  I don't know how bad Milly Cunningham is, but at least he can run around.
*  One of the things that's crazy about the past QB situation,
*  like these guys combined today, they were 12 for 21 for 89 yards.
*  They threw three picks and no touchdowns.
*  And they had zero rushes.
*  So not only are they terrible pocket passers,
*  but you don't have to worry about like even P.J.
*  Walker, who's terrible, right?
*  But at least with P.J.
*  Walker, it's like, oh, he might run for first down.
*  You at least like there's some linebackers like we got to worry about this guy a little bit.
*  The Pats, if terrible quarterbacks were also slow and clumsy,
*  so you don't have to worry about anything other than them just throwing the ball to you.
*  The Giants got 10 first downs and they won the Pats defense,
*  which lost you down in Gonzalez and is allowed 40 points in the last three weeks.
*  Combined all losses.
*  And this is the darkest Patriots season in 31 years.
*  And you should feel nothing but pity for Bill Belichick.
*  And God forbid, let him scratch out a winner to root for him.
*  In these close games, they do it for Bill, both bills, you and Belichick.
*  I don't see any other way to root for this.
*  All right. But here's the counter with the Belichick thing,
*  who brought us six Super Bowls, and I love the man.
*  He did pick all these players.
*  It's not like there was another GM or another like
*  he's trying to do all these jobs at once, which made a lot more sense
*  when he was in his 50s and maybe even in his early 60s.
*  But now he's in his 70s, still trying to do it.
*  And they've just whiffed on these drafts in dramatic ways.
*  And on on top of it, taking guys that actually seem pretty promising,
*  like I'm sorry, Mac was pretty good two years ago.
*  Like he he was the signs of something.
*  He played really good games there.
*  I think two years ago this weekend, they beat Tennessee
*  and Tennessee was the one seed in the AFC.
*  And Mac was he threw for like 300 yards and had a really good game
*  and just looked like crisp and like a game manager.
*  And two years later, he looks like he's private pile in full metal jacket.
*  So at some point, like developing a QB and having the right coaching staff,
*  that's part of Belichick.
*  But we don't know. Don't get me wrong.
*  I love it. I love every minute of it.
*  I'm rooting against them, but you should root for.
*  That's all I'm saying.
*  I'm supposed to root for wins. Why?
*  I want to get a quarterback.
*  So Saruti watches even more college football than you, Sal.
*  Or maybe it's a dead heat. I don't know.
*  It might be a tie.
*  He could take the title. Yeah.
*  I'd like I I'm going to sit out this quarterback thing
*  because I have not watched enough quarterback stuff in the in the draft.
*  There's Caleb Williams, whoever I'm saying after a sophomore year
*  looked like the next Mahomes.
*  And then there's Drake May and everybody is like, no, no,
*  he's the stealth franchise guy. Watch out for him.
*  So, so Rudy, we are now in the end of November.
*  Are either of these guys slam dunks?
*  Like, where do you have them? Who would you compare them to?
*  I mean, we're still always talks about this.
*  Like the problem with Caleb is he was so good last year,
*  obviously won the Heisman that the expectations are so high.
*  And the USC team, like the defense is as bad as there is in the entire country.
*  So he's constantly having to throw for like five touchdowns and four yards a game.
*  And that's an impossible thing to do.
*  So, of course, as he makes mistakes, you know, it's not looking as fun
*  as it was last year. So he's getting knocked down a peg.
*  Plus, he had this thing where he was crying with his mom on the stands
*  after the Washington loss.
*  And he was talking about after a game one time, they wanted to go home
*  and cuddle with his dog.
*  So he's really going to test like the horror.
*  That's very New England. It's very New England.
*  I like that. Yeah, they love him there.
*  He's going to really test like the meathead,
*  hardo, like draft guys of whether or not like, is this guy an actual NFL quarterback?
*  Is he like the guy you want to lead your franchise?
*  Do you want to toss him the car keys?
*  Yeah, yeah. You know, you're going to get galvanized guys.
*  I don't really get worried about that stuff.
*  I mean, Drake May has definitely risen in a lot of.
*  I mean, he's he's goes one to to the Bears and a lot of mocks now.
*  And that was certainly before the season was all Caleb.
*  So it's definitely a conversation for sure, at least with the mock draft expert guys.
*  But is really did you like did you like Bryce Young last year?
*  Did you like I did?
*  Did you think Mac Jones was a good pick?
*  Did you think he was a top four guy three years ago like this?
*  You got to get so lucky with this.
*  You hit like 34 percent.
*  You're the great draft guys.
*  You know, there's actually like, I mean, even if you go beyond Caleb Williams
*  and and and Drake, there's, you know, Jayden Daniels, he might win the Heisman.
*  He's unreal at LSU this year, putting up legit video game stats.
*  Bo Nix kind of looks like not to make the Oregon comparison.
*  He's like a poor man's Justin Herbert.
*  He's physically pretty impressive.
*  You got McCarthy at Michigan, Michael Panic, Shador Sanders.
*  Like there's a lot of like actually kind of even if you don't get one of the top two,
*  there's a few guys maybe the paths can get later in the first or early
*  in the second round.
*  But there's I want to throw something at you, though, guys, and specifically you, Bill,
*  because they say I think third right now in the draft order.
*  So and there's a lot of that.
*  I think they're second now.
*  Second or third, I forget.
*  I'm looking at now their second now.
*  So second either way.
*  So if they end up getting Caleb or say they get Drake May, who knows?
*  Is there is there like a cop to like the Greg Popovich getting Wembe,
*  like Belichick getting one of these young quarterbacks?
*  Is that like a thing or are we just completely sour in a bellatrix
*  the part where he has to go if there's a new quarterback?
*  So on one of my pets Twitter things that I follow,
*  they retweeted somebody who said this in May after the Spurs got Wembe.
*  And they were like, now watch the Pats try to do this with Caleb Williams.
*  I guess Sal makes the key point.
*  And I know Brasila has done a lot of stuff on this on his pod about what a coin toss
*  this is. And I remember even writing about this at Grandland.
*  I don't think it's ever changed.
*  Like it used to be 50 percent if it's like a top six quarterback.
*  And now it feels like it's around 35 to 40.
*  So you spend all this time hoping you land somebody.
*  But then it's situation.
*  It's offensive line.
*  It's like what happened with Bryce Young?
*  Like if you put Bryce Young in Houston and CJ Stroud in Carolina,
*  I have no idea what the sliding doors thing would be.
*  I guess my thing, Sal, is Belichick's history.
*  Everything we've learned from the guy since he took over with the Pats
*  would indicate that he would get this pick
*  and try to turn it into as much value as possible and trade backwards
*  and try to get all these different things.
*  Like it would be like his dream situations.
*  Like, oh, I turn this into seven assets.
*  But the Pats fans are sitting here going, you're batting 10 percent
*  on your last like six traps.
*  Like, please don't get more draft picks. Just take the guy.
*  So what do you where do you stand on all this?
*  So here's where I stand.
*  I watched a lot of college football this weekend.
*  And, you know, and I see a lot of guys, JJ McCarthy, Drake, May.
*  All these guys are good decision makers.
*  And I know that's not going to translate in the pros.
*  And it's depressing.
*  It's like, I know this guy is going to suck on Atlanta or whatever.
*  I just I could I could feel it in my bones.
*  Bryce Young was a good decision maker.
*  You know, right. He was a good good.
*  I don't want to say game manager, but he's a good technician.
*  Bo Nicks is like throwing for 80 percent.
*  Right. It's insane.
*  And getting out of this nifty, getting out of the pocket and getting out of trouble.
*  But, you know, it's not going to translate.
*  So your eyes end up playing tricks on you.
*  And I don't know. I have a couple of my favorites.
*  I like Bo Nicks and I like McCarthy and I like Drake May.
*  But I don't know that those guys are going to be good or one or two
*  or three of them are going to be good.
*  Here's the thing. Half those guys, too, they've got better weapons
*  at college than somebody like the than the Pats do.
*  You know, like Drake made.
*  I mean, certainly Jane Daniels, Bo Nicks, probably maybe even Caleb.
*  They've got they just have better weapons than the Pats do right now.
*  So if you if you put like those guys in this exact Pats office,
*  they're going to struggle.
*  Well, then you think.
*  Minshew is six and five with the Colts right now.
*  Right. And over and over again, you want and like the Lions were able to turn
*  their their fortunes around by making that staffer trade and putting golf behind
*  like what seemed on paper to be a really good offensive line.
*  It was a good last Thursday.
*  But sometimes I wonder, does it just make the most sense?
*  Just take every year, there's one incredible left tackle.
*  Just take that guy and then just keep building around your lines.
*  And then eventually you're going to be able to grab one of these
*  either disgraced quarterbacks who failed another team
*  or some middling quarterback or whatever.
*  And you might be better off because there's only what?
*  32 Team League.
*  There's only like five guys who actually make a difference.
*  And if these if none of these guys in the draft are going to be one of those five
*  guys, then take Marvin Harrison or the left tackle.
*  That'd be my. So how far would you drop drop in the draft to take
*  gardener Minshew if you could have gardener Minshew on the team next year?
*  Well, like or like a Brock Purdy, right?
*  That's your best case scenario for like I didn't have to waste a high first round.
*  I think it's so complicated and so hard to figure out.
*  I can't believe we're not better at it.
*  And I talked about this a few weeks ago, but I just like in basketball
*  almost all the time that makes sense to me. Right.
*  Like even you watch like somebody like Franz on Orlando.
*  And I'm sure the Warriors are like kicking themselves.
*  I brought up France to make somebody happy.
*  Appreciate that. Like Franz, the stuff he did in college,
*  like you could see if it was the right type of team
*  that took advantage of the things he was good at, it would make sense
*  that he would become a good pro.
*  Halliburton was like, you know, that the advanced stat people,
*  like they loved him. They were like, here's the great thing.
*  He doesn't need to have the ball. He's putting up huge stats.
*  Very rarely do we have like shocking NBA success stories.
*  But in the NFL, like the CJ Stroud, Bryce Young thing to me
*  that everyone argued about that for what, three months?
*  Yeah. And then you watch CJ Stroud today.
*  I know they lost, but the guys got so much poise.
*  There was times in that game where Jacksonville was coming at him
*  that whole game and he was escaping and stopping and just taking the extra
*  two seconds like, man, this guy has it. There's no question.
*  Well, why didn't we know that in April?
*  Well, remember, there was this like Ohio State quarterback thing
*  where people were saying, you know, is the system what they do in Ohio State?
*  Like, is that just those guys weren't translating to the pros.
*  It was like three or four different guys.
*  And so I think that kind of knocked him.
*  Plus, they've had awesome receipt.
*  They've had like two wide receivers draft in the first round.
*  I think the last like two years, they're going to have another one this year.
*  So it's like, is it the system is the weapons or is it the quarterback?
*  So that was the question, I think, around.
*  I mean, everybody, I think before the draft, said Stroud was the one
*  that threw the best ball.
*  It was just is he the system and the and the weapons or is it all him?
*  And, you know, it's probably a little bit of both.
*  It's like, did you guys?
*  Simmons, like he got typecast for being Fonzie and couldn't get a job after that.
*  That's sort of what happens to these Ohio State guys.
*  Like, yeah, all right.
*  But you had all these receivers and everything.
*  And I don't care that you had you had Anson Williams.
*  Yeah, right. Yeah.
*  Rita, 48 points against Georgia.
*  You had Big Al breathing down your neck.
*  So it didn't matter. But yeah.
*  Did you guys think Burrow was a slam dunk when he was coming out?
*  Because he had like the greatest college year in the history of college football.
*  But was he considered a slam dunk?
*  He was so poised and all those things you say.
*  Well, you talked about.
*  But it was really just that senior year, though. Right, Saruti?
*  Yeah, I mean, he was an Ohio State quarterback that transferred out.
*  Yeah, and went to LSU.
*  So he found a home there.
*  And that was arguably the most talented team.
*  And I mean, I'd ban Lathan would tell you that's the best team in the history
*  of college football he played on.
*  So it was it was not.
*  I mean, I like I mean, people like Burrows moxie, like the guys just.
*  I mean, you just love that guy when you spend probably two seconds with him.
*  He's just a dude.
*  But no, he was not a slam dunk.
*  I mean, Trevor, I think people thought Trevor Lawrence was more of a slam dunk
*  than Burrow was for sure.
*  But Drake, man, Caleb Williams, they're not on the Trevor Lawrence slam dunk level.
*  It does not seem I don't think Caleb Williams under pressure.
*  Caleb Williams is pressured more than any other quarterback
*  because their line is weird and everything else.
*  And, you know, his numbers under pressure are not great.
*  That's the only thing that's the only thing I would my only reservation with him
*  because he can sling it.
*  He resembles my homes a lot and his mannerisms and everything else.
*  And you don't want to pass on them just for that reason.
*  But under pressure, it's a whole different story.
*  And you have that sample size with him.
*  Yeah, to your to your point, Bill, I think when we miss drafting on these
*  quarterbacks, so much of it is about just like what what team and system you're
*  drafted into, like who's your coach, who's your up?
*  Like you're getting Andy Reid, you can call Shanahan or you get in the jets.
*  You know, like it's and Jalen Hurts, if he was if he goes somewhere else,
*  is he Jalen Hurts that we know now?
*  Maybe. Probably not, though.
*  And so I think, again, like a lot of these guys, if he goes to the Bears,
*  I we were talking, could Caleb say, hey, I actually don't want to go there.
*  Could he pull an Eli Manning?
*  You say now I'm going to pass or because he could always come back to school, too.
*  And now with the NL stuff, like these guys could make money.
*  It's not like they're going to be you know, maybe they might not make it
*  like, you know, whatever an NFL rookie is going to make, but they'll make close to it.
*  So who knows? Like they have that chip, too.
*  It would seem like one quality would be there's some sort of competitive
*  gene that these guys have or don't have.
*  Like I heard Lombardi last week on his podcast was talking about Zach Wilson
*  about that he just didn't feel like Zach Wilson had the competitive
*  intensity for a three hour football game, that he had the,
*  you know, desire or intent to just dominate that some of these great guys have.
*  Like the like the best guys.
*  And I think this is the same way in basketball.
*  These guys that it's not even just about the sport they're playing,
*  but they're on the plane playing cards.
*  They're playing Scrabble, you know, on the fucking bus.
*  Like anything they're doing, they're trying to win, win, win, win.
*  And I think Burroughs like that.
*  But like last year, you would have said Bryce Young was like that.
*  And then you watch him on Carolina.
*  He's the shell of himself.
*  So is that the offensive lines followed?
*  Is that Frank Reck? He's throwing to Adam Thielen.
*  Like to me, the Bryce Young thing screws it up more than anything
*  because he's in the worst possible situation.
*  And we have no idea if he's good or not.
