# Patrick Mahomes Craps the Bed, Philly Cruises in SB 59 + Tales from N.O. | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [February 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY)
*  All right, we're recording about 20 minutes after Super Bowl 59, a true dud. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=0.0s)]
*  Cousin Sal is here. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=5.68s)]
*  I was shellacked. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=7.48s)]
*  My bets were shellacked. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=8.48s)]
*  Million dollar picks were shellacked. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=10.08s)]
*  I can't wait to talk about something that happened at the end of the game. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=11.8s)]
*  Mahomes was terrible. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=15.52s)]
*  Talk slow, Bill. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=16.52s)]
*  I don't want it to end. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=18.28s)]
*  The season ends after this hour. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=19.64s)]
*  I know, you're right. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=21.2s)]
*  So talk very slowly. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=22.2s)]
*  Let's savor the conversation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=23.52s)]
*  I'm going to talk slow. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=25.0s)]
*  As slow as that Eagles when they had the interception touchdown on the off sides, when the guy just [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=26.48s)]
*  should have basically run back and forth on the one yard line like you would do in Madden [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  and make one of the Chiefs have to run 70 yards to tackle him. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=36.4s)]
*  He could have run off like a minute of the clock. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=39.36s)]
*  You're right. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=41.72s)]
*  He could have killed the last seven minutes, but it didn't matter. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=42.72s)]
*  So let's go positive because there's so many Chiefs angles, but let's go positive. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  The Eagles who had an awesome season, who had three losses that if like three plays [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=48.36s)]
*  went there from the three losses, they were like an undefeated level team. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=54.88s)]
*  Nobody kicked their ass. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=58.28s)]
*  And then the last two games of the season, they kicked Washington's ass. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=59.96s)]
*  They kicked the Chief's ass. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=63.92s)]
*  How good was this team for you? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=67.4s)]
*  I think they were excellent and they peaked at the right time. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=69.6s)]
*  I don't want to take a damn thing away from them. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=72.64s)]
*  I mean, I'm a Cowboys fan, so this is a nightmare. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=74.44s)]
*  I mean, just being a Cowboys fan is a nightmare. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=77.12s)]
*  That part. But did you ever when did you put them in your top three? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=78.88s)]
*  Because I don't think it's in the last two weeks, maybe the three weeks. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=83.44s)]
*  It's just weird. Like, we should remember this like the best team. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=87.44s)]
*  We may not even be on our radar until we like 21. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=90.88s)]
*  But kudos to them. They deserve it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=94.52s)]
*  Both sides of the ball dominant. Good for them. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=96.52s)]
*  Well, we always felt like Baltimore and Philly were the best on paper teams, but we [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=99.24s)]
*  didn't know what that meant. And then when you think like Baltimore has got to be [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=103.6s)]
*  just absolutely kicking themselves so hard where it's like, oh, man, we probably [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=106.96s)]
*  could have done what Philly did to the Chiefs and we just weren't able to get to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=111.39999999999999s)]
*  the game. But, you know, we knew the defense was there. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  I remember doing the million dollar picks scenario on Thursday and it was like [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=117.6s)]
*  there was two games. I felt like this could be it could be the be like that [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=120.72s)]
*  awesome Pat Seattle game back and forth. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  Chiefs win in the end. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=126.44s)]
*  Or it could end up being like that that Bucks Chiefs game, the 31 to 9 game [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  when they couldn't block anybody, when they were off the whole game. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=133.72s)]
*  And we talked on a bunch of different pods about if you like the Eagles, just [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=137.0s)]
*  take them minus nine and a half. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=141.12s)]
*  Take them minus 19 and a half. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=142.6s)]
*  Just take them in some sort of blowout situation, because if it was a close game, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=144.20000000000002s)]
*  the Chiefs history was they're going to win. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  You were on Ringer Sunday pregame talking about all the same stats. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=149.08s)]
*  Everyone else was 17 and 0 in the one score games for Mahomes, 17 and 3 in the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  playoffs. The recipe to beat him was to basically beat the shit out of them and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=157.72s)]
*  blow them out, which is easier said than done. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=161.68s)]
*  The Eagles did it. It was great. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=163.68s)]
*  I think Mahomes actually may have been smart. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=165.24s)]
*  He purposely got blown out so that he could still say he's 117 straight, one [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=167.60000000000002s)]
*  score. He's streaks alive. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  I got the street going. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=173.96s)]
*  It was a yes, you're right. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=177.72s)]
*  I mean, this was the this was the recipe. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=179.68s)]
*  And like these, you know, they they drafted all these SEC guys, right? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=182.96s)]
*  The defensive lineman, all these Georgia guys. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  And it's like maybe the first year or two, they weren't great. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=189.12s)]
*  A couple of more. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=191.88s)]
*  Jalen Carter, you could tell, was going to be great. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=192.56s)]
*  But it's almost like they had to go to college a second time in the pros [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=194.36s)]
*  to get great for two or three years. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=198.16000000000003s)]
*  And now they're spectacular. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=200.32000000000002s)]
*  I mean, that had to remind you in a bad way of I mean, it's great because you [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=201.60000000000002s)]
*  could brag on Brady now and the Patriots dynasty. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=206.04000000000002s)]
*  Oh, I'm not going to do that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=208.76000000000002s)]
*  That no, no, I'm sure you don't have a segment for that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=209.88000000000002s)]
*  But on the other hand, this is how the Giants beat the Patriots. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=212.84s)]
*  This is how the Giants beat Jim Kelly in the Bills, right? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  This is how Tampa beat the the Chiefs a couple of years ago. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=219.84s)]
*  So I'm in a six six six with no blitzes. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=223.68s)]
*  Like it's insane. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=227.24s)]
*  You're you're you're toast if that's the case. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=228.04000000000002s)]
*  It was the worst fear if you're a Chiefs fan because you were [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=230.8s)]
*  already nervous about your line. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=233.32s)]
*  You already felt like you were sneaking by game after game. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=234.92000000000002s)]
*  You have a left guard playing left tackle, which we saw Jeff Saturday on Friday night. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=237.72s)]
*  We were asking him about it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=242.36s)]
*  Just like how hard is that to go from guard to tackle? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=245.16s)]
*  And he was he's basically saying, well, when you're a guard, you're a guard for a reason. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=247.8s)]
*  Your arms are too short. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=252.52s)]
*  You're not tall enough. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=254.24s)]
*  You're not quite strong enough. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=255.48000000000002s)]
*  Your footwork's not quite good enough. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=256.96000000000004s)]
*  That's how you end up being guard instead of a tackle. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=258.56s)]
*  And it's like when you're playing a guard as a tackle, it's usually a little bit of a dangerous sign. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=260.56s)]
*  He meant to say it's as hard as going from NFL analyst to head coach. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=265.08s)]
*  I didn't know how to read that up. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=271.92s)]
*  But but so if you're the Chiefs are going into the game and you're going, well, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=273.04s)]
*  we've gotten pretty lucky in some of these close games. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=278.2s)]
*  Everyone's taking us and we do have some holes that the right team could maybe get. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=280.8s)]
*  But the recipe of this game wasn't what I thought, even though it was the blowout part. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=286.72s)]
*  Mahomes was awful. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=292.44s)]
*  Hertz was really good. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=294.36s)]
*  Hertz didn't just outplay Mahomes like he badly, badly outclassed Mahomes, which I thought was [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  yeah, was was pretty nuts. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=301.6s)]
*  Hertz outplays Mahomes and everybody was saying all week, the Eagles have a better team. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=303.64000000000004s)]
*  But, you know, QB and coach late game stuff, I got to take the Chiefs and then the QB coach [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=308.64s)]
*  thing, they didn't get either of their own. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=313.6s)]
*  No, they certainly didn't. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=315.48s)]
*  And now there's a lot of love and probably deservedly so for Sirianni, right? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=317.16s)]
*  It only doesn't make the playoffs. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=321.16s)]
*  It goes to championship games and won the Super Bowl and lost one. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=322.56s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, I don't know what to say. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=326.6s)]
*  It looked like he was going to be fired in September. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=328.88s)]
*  It looked like he was going to make it to Halloween. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=330.84s)]
*  It's really, really weird what goes on. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=333.48s)]
*  Mahomes like I don't want to blame him fully because he's been great. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=335.56s)]
*  And that offensive line just got manhandled. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=339.03999999999996s)]
*  But early on, he didn't help himself out trying to trying to wedge, you know, get those [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=341.15999999999997s)]
*  passes into Kelsey, who couldn't bend over to catch him. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=346.2s)]
*  There were bad throws anyway. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=348.47999999999996s)]
*  And then those interceptions were just abysmal. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=349.44s)]
*  So we had the worst jobs. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=351.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=354.68s)]
*  And Hertz was great. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=355.32s)]
*  Like even Hertz had that on the first drive. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=356.59999999999997s)]
*  He had a perfect throw down the sideline to A.J. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=358.47999999999996s)]
*  Brown that got called back for a pretty shaky pass interference. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=361.03999999999996s)]
*  And then everybody had the same reaction. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=364.76000000000005s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=366.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=367.44000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=368.0s)]
*  I have all that written down. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=368.24s)]
*  And that is the one good thing about this. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=369.72s)]
*  Like it didn't come down to that. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=371.56s)]
*  And I was like, OK, they called the P.I. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=373.40000000000003s)]
*  on Brown, but the Eagles got it back on that dumb call, that even worse call and got it. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=375.04s)]
*  So thank God we're not talking about the refs. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=379.6s)]
*  We're not leading with him. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=381.6s)]
*  I don't even know why I'm talking about him now, but that's the one good thing about a [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=382.44000000000005s)]
*  blowout like this. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=385.64000000000004s)]
*  But I wasn't sure that Hertz was going to get like MVP until the second half, until he [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=386.52000000000004s)]
*  started running. He ran for like two first downs. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=390.64000000000004s)]
*  He was really good. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=392.64000000000004s)]
*  Cooper Dejean could maybe sneak in. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=393.56s)]
*  But yeah, they had to give it to him by the end. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=395.32s)]
*  Yeah, he was I thought I mean, he only had five incompletions. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=397.6s)]
*  He was 11 for 72 running. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=401.2s)]
*  He had some pretty back breaking runs at the perfect times. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=402.88s)]
*  He had some really nice throws. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=406.92s)]
*  I didn't feel like other than that pick, which it was a pick, but it also wasn't like [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=408.48s)]
*  the worst thing in the world. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=413.92s)]
*  The guy got tackled at the two. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=414.84000000000003s)]
*  It was a nice play and they went three and now I mean, it could not get a first down [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=416.68s)]
*  early on. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=420.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=421.64000000000004s)]
*  But you think that Barkley was 25 for 57. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=422.12s)]
*  The Chiefs were saying, you're not beating you're not beating us with Barkley. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=424.76000000000005s)]
*  That didn't matter because, you know, Hertz was getting these plays and then Mahomes was [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=428.84000000000003s)]
*  just awful. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=433.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, so I'm looking big picture for the for the Eagles side of this incredible [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=434.76000000000005s)]
*  drafting for a couple of years in a row, which is the key to everything. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=441.20000000000005s)]
*  And this was as you know, obviously was so focused on that 20 year Pats run and it [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=446.52000000000004s)]
*  always ebbed and flowed with the drafts. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=451.92s)]
*  They always had Brady and Belichick and it always came down to could they get two or [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=453.72s)]
*  three good drafts in a row? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=457.52000000000004s)]
*  And if they didn't, that's when the team started to fall apart. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=459.0s)]
*  The Eagles had the opposite. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=461.28000000000003s)]
*  They just nailed drafts. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=462.88s)]
*  They had some luck like Jaylen Carter for us to nine because he had a pretty terrible [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=463.92s)]
*  car accident or car crash incident with one of his teammates and he falls seven spots [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=469.28000000000003s)]
*  lower than he should have. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=474.28s)]
*  Even even our guy Coop, I mean, he fell to thirty nine. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=476.0s)]
*  He was the third best defensive back in the draft. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=479.88s)]
*  The Pats passed on him, traded back, passed on him again. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=482.03999999999996s)]
*  And it's just over and over again. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=486.35999999999996s)]
*  They're nailing these dudes. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=488.28s)]
*  And then Barkley was one of the best signings of the decade. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=489.2s)]
*  Yeah, it really has been just a master class for the last two, two and a half years. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=492.47999999999996s)]
*  I could see the pain in your eyes. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=496.59999999999997s)]
*  It's really been a master class. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=498.91999999999996s)]
*  Fuck this shit. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=500.35999999999996s)]
*  Well, like what could be worse for a Cowboys fan? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=501.28s)]
*  I want to make it about me, but that now, you know, Jayden Daniels, we do in this [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=503.36s)]
*  pod, we make it about us. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=507.44s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=508.6s)]
*  Could be around for a decade in the division. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=509.44s)]
*  Oh, and the Eagles are great after losing the same last six inexplicably last year. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=511.76s)]
*  And my team has gone to shit. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=516.92s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, I can't say enough about this Eagles team. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=518.4s)]
*  I mean, really just, I don't know. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=521.8000000000001s)]
*  But then again, if you look at if you saw twenty five for fifty seven for Barkley, how [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=524.16s)]
*  much more would we have put on the Chiefs? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=528.52s)]
*  I know it's. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=530.88s)]
*  So you think like even with this, even with the playoffs for the Eagles, right? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=532.3199999999999s)]
*  First round, they played Green Bay solid game. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=537.24s)]
*  Twenty two, ten shut Green Bay down. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=541.4s)]
*  Offense wasn't great. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=545.12s)]
*  Some hurts questions remained. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=546.4399999999999s)]
*  The Rams game, they're up comfortably the whole game. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=548.28s)]
*  Then at the end, defense gets tired and it felt like the Rams were going to steal the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=552.16s)]
*  game and there was some signs and it's like, Kurtz couldn't put them away. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=556.0s)]
*  And it's like, huh, what's that? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=559.44s)]
*  But then those last two games, the Washington and the Casey games are about as good. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=562.6800000000001s)]
*  And we did on the other side of this where we've written teams over the years, like the [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=566.8800000000001s)]
*  2000 Ravens was one of my favorite that Bucks team with Brady. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=570.8000000000001s)]
*  That was another one. This was another one of those teams that just got better over the [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=574.48s)]
*  four rounds, had this defense was just felt like they peaked at the perfect time, unlike [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=577.7600000000001s)]
*  the Chiefs. Yeah, we did the opposite of peaking because all those games you mentioned, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=583.36s)]
*  the Eagles won the turnover battle, right? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=588.56s)]
*  And the Chiefs pretty much won the turnover battle except against Buffalo. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=590.4399999999999s)]
*  But you always thought like, all right, it's not going to be the case that the Chiefs are [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=593.04s)]
*  going to get crushed in turnovers, right? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=597.68s)]
*  And they did. It was three to one is a crushing and, you know, thirty seven, twenty three [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=599.76s)]
*  for time of possession is even worse. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=604.56s)]
*  I mean, you know, the homes ends up with decent numbers, but now you can't say enough. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=606.8s)]
*  We're saving that for next segment. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=610.76s)]
*  Couple of things with the Eagles that we should just remember from a playoff manifesto [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=614.0799999999999s)]
*  standpoint. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=617.68s)]
*  Casey was negotiating for that three Pete. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=620.52s)]
*  That story came out during the week. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=624.4s)]
*  Yeah, they were negotiating with Pat Riley about the three Pete and how to pay. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=627.16s)]
*  That's going in the manifesto. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=631.92s)]
*  I'm putting it next year in the playoff manifesto. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=633.4399999999999s)]
*  If one team is negotiating for what's going to happen after they win the title, that's [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=636.16s)]
*  immediately a fuck you. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=640.76s)]
*  Like, I wish I can't believe I didn't like factor that into anything. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=642.3199999999999s)]
*  Come on. You put that you put that right in the chalkboard. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=645.84s)]
*  This team's already like negotiating after they think they're going to win. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=648.72s)]
*  Like you are we going to. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=651.88s)]
*  It's just I don't know. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=653.04s)]
*  That seemed like not nothing. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=654.3199999999999s)]
*  You don't think did Pat Riley bet the Eagles? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=655.76s)]
*  I mean, that would have been a nice hedge because he lost a lot of money on t-shirts [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=658.16s)]
*  and everything else now for this. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=661.08s)]
*  Pat Riley had five million dollars on the parley. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=663.12s)]
*  Jimmy Butler's first game with the Warriors. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=665.84s)]
*  Yeah, I guess it is. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=668.4399999999999s)]
*  I guess they wore a bunch of red red flags. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=669.72s)]
*  There's a revenge thing, too, right? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=672.04s)]
*  Because they lost to the Chiefs a couple of years ago. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=673.4s)]
*  So that was in there. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=675.48s)]
*  But the lesson for me. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=677.04s)]
*  And this was the single worst game to talk about ever since we've been doing this, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=680.0799999999999s)]
*  because everybody almost the analysis didn't matter because it all came down to, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=684.76s)]
*  well, the Eagles are better really everywhere. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=690.76s)]
*  But, you know, you can't go against the Chiefs like that. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=693.36s)]
*  That was literally including me and including you. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=696.16s)]
*  It was like that. So now I feel like we're back. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=698.8s)]
*  Now we can analyze football games correctly again, and now we can actually have takes [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=701.32s)]
*  because the Chiefs have kind of ruined it like the fucking Luka trade took over the [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=705.36s)]
*  Super Bowl discourse all week because it was like it wasn't even fun to talk about [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=709.84s)]
*  this Eagles game. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=713.28s)]
*  Well, now 80 is out a month. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=714.48s)]
*  And so now it looks like Dallas didn't get a steal. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=716.28s)]
*  Like everybody was clamoring that they really won that. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=718.72s)]
*  And now, though, no. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=720.92s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. Yes, you're right. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=722.8s)]
*  We can go back to I just don't think that I don't know. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=724.48s)]
*  Well, yeah, I know we spend like hours talking about, should this be [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=728.96s)]
*  one? Should this be one and a half? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=731.2s)]
*  Why? Oh, yeah. Is the number going to flip? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=733.0s)]
*  It never matters. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=734.76s)]
*  And you're right. We we don't have to go because I felt like anybody. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=736.24s)]
*  I was just at a Super Bowl party who didn't know a thing about football can come in, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=740.2s)]
*  not watching and be like, oh, it's just tough to pick against the Chiefs. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=743.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm like, shit, that's what I've been saying with Simmons for the last two weeks. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=746.5200000000001s)]
*  That's what everyone was saying. I was right. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=749.9200000000001s)]
*  Should we just live in New Orleans since Friday? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=752.08s)]
*  That was everybody's analysis was well, you can't go against the Chiefs. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=753.76s)]
*  Nothing else to add. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=757.24s)]
*  The Chiefs are good. They won the coach. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=758.88s)]
*  Quarterback coming and they win close game. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=760.6400000000001s)]
*  So don't you know, it's a long off season. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=762.5600000000001s)]
*  I'll feel OK betting that I didn't want to lose this way, though, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=765.32s)]
*  where where my home doesn't show up at all. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=768.4000000000001s)]
*  And the line gets there were like no signs that the line was going to get overpowered. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=770.2800000000001s)]
*  Was it like this? I didn't think that was the case. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=774.1600000000001s)]
*  I don't feel why didn't this happen to the Rams? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=776.9200000000001s)]
*  You know, even Washington, like last week, Daniels moved the ball [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=780.08s)]
*  really well against the Eagles. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=783.1600000000001s)]
*  And when you look back at the mistakes that they made, it was nothing [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=784.7600000000001s)]
*  that had to do with him. He was moving around. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=787.6s)]
*  He was felt like he was in control of the game. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=789.84s)]
*  And then his supporting cast kind of screwed the game up. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=791.72s)]
*  So, you know, but on the other hand, they had two weeks to prepare. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=794.9200000000001s)]
*  They obviously came in thinking if we can get a lead. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=798.36s)]
*  We can, you know, we're going to be able to dominate this game. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=802.0s)]
*  And that's what I did. I was in the I watched the game. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=805.48s)]
*  I was in the Fandel suite. Our friends look at you. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=808.36s)]
*  Yeah, it was great. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=811.0s)]
*  It was actually really fun getting some of the insights of, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=811.9200000000001s)]
*  you know, where people had too much money, not enough money, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=815.44s)]
*  some of the props like that. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=818.36s)]
*  Everybody, the Barkley Barkley was under on everything. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=820.04s)]
*  He didn't score a touchdown. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=823.28s)]
*  Like so all those hit the Kelsey stuff was way under. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=824.6s)]
*  My homes was under for a while. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=827.4s)]
*  But the big thing they were saying was the line never moved. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=828.5600000000001s)]
*  And even though everybody that we saw all weekend in New Orleans [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=831.76s)]
*  was like Casey, Casey, Casey, Casey, the betting was pretty even. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=834.48s)]
*  And a lot of the sharp money was on Philly. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=839.12s)]
*  So the line stayed the same, which, you know, is usually kind of a red flag. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=841.04s)]
*  I think the public all thinks the chiefs are going to win. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=845.2s)]
*  But yet the lines not moving. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=847.4s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And like the adjusted lines one, right. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=848.68s)]
*  If they did take your advice and take the minus nine and a half and stuff like that. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=851.88s)]
*  And the over, which wasn't looking good for a while, ended up coming in in a big way. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=855.0799999999999s)]
*  So but I mean, there are some, you know, there are some crazy. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=859.4s)]
*  I don't know, like Hertz first touchdown that you see. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=863.68s)]
*  You said they got beat on that, right? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=866.4s)]
*  Oh, let's talk about that. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=868.52s)]
*  So Dotson catches a long touchdown. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=869.6s)]
*  Yeah, Dotson was 85 to one. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=872.04s)]
*  Incredible to to be the first touchdown. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=874.72s)]
*  They're celebrating. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=878.4s)]
*  It seemed like a touchdown watching from the stands unquestionably a touchdown. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=879.4399999999999s)]
*  And then they review it. It's like, whoop, not a touch. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=883.52s)]
*  All of a sudden we're pushing. Right. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=885.3199999999999s)]
*  They had Hertz anytime touchdown Hertz first touchdown was one of the most popular bets. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=887.24s)]
*  So that was a loss. I had I had both of those. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=893.24s)]
*  And I had under one and a half for shortest touchdown. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=896.28s)]
*  So it was either going to come from Hertz or Barkley or Kareem Hunt or something like that. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=898.6s)]
*  So that was about the only thing I won. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=902.1999999999999s)]
*  But 85 to one, I know they give money back sometimes if a guy gets hurt on the first snap. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=904.4399999999999s)]
*  She get a little money back if you had Dotson at 85 to one. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=910.0799999999999s)]
*  It's just some pity, but eight inch line. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=913.68s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I had one of that because Gantwick's legal here in Louisiana. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=915.52s)]
*  So I did a bunch of Super Bowl bets and that you're not going to believe it. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=919.0799999999999s)]
*  But I didn't do great. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=922.68s)]
*  One of the ones I had was was Hertz first touchdown with Chiefs to win the game. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=924.36s)]
*  And it was 15 to one. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=930.04s)]
*  So Hertz scored. And then you go in the app and you can be like, you can get out of this right now. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=931.8s)]
*  And I'm like, do I get out of this? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=936.0s)]
*  I don't really like the way the Chiefs like that. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=937.4s)]
*  It's the Chiefs. It's my homes like to the bitter end. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=939.4799999999999s)]
*  Even when it was what? 17, nothing after the pick six. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=942.64s)]
*  You're going, oh, this is a 28 three. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=945.9599999999999s)]
*  He's going to come back. And he just never did. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=947.68s)]
*  It shows up on the app like what? Bill, this is a wellness check. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=949.64s)]
*  You can get out now. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=952.9599999999999s)]
*  We're going to give you three more warnings. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=954.52s)]
*  Bill, please log off. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=956.5999999999999s)]
*  All right. So with my homes, it was feeling at some point. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=957.9599999999999s)]
*  If you were promo homes, pro, this is the guy on par with Brady. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=961.52s)]
*  All that stuff is like, could this be his 20 to three game, including when when when Coop got the pick six? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=966.12s)]
*  It's like, oh, we're now following the recipe for the 28, three Falcons game. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=972.52s)]
*  Then it gets to what was it? 24, nothing. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=976.6800000000001s)]
*  It was the same thing. It's like, oh, OK, this this this would be it. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=979.04s)]
*  Maybe we're joking in this in the suite like, oh, maybe he's doing this intentionally. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=982.84s)]
*  Maybe maybe he wanted to add this degree of difficulty [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=988.2s)]
*  comeback thing to the whole Mahomes goat legacy that he ends up with the three P with a huge comeback. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=991.52s)]
*  That was not what happened. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=996.96s)]
*  So it was not even close to what happened. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=997.96s)]
*  And I got to say, he was terrible. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1000.12s)]
*  He was terrible from the first drive. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1002.44s)]
*  He had that second down pass to Kelsey. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1003.96s)]
*  They were moving the ball. They got a first down. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1006.16s)]
*  They seemed like they had a little momentum. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1008.4s)]
*  Kelsey over the middle and throws a way behind them. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1010.44s)]
*  And I swear he must had 10 terrible passes. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1012.76s)]
*  I'm not counting what happened in the fourth quarter. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1015.8399999999999s)]
*  The game is over and the game mattered. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1017.28s)]
*  He was it was the worst he's ever played by far. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1019.0s)]
*  We were like, I don't know if you could bet on something like this, but like, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1021.92s)]
*  do we hear Tuesday that he had rotator cuff tear or something? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1024.8s)]
*  Because like a torn labrum. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1028.72s)]
*  Yeah, like a hip flexor. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1031.2s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1033.84s)]
*  Because there was a place where he was scrambling around [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1034.96s)]
*  and it looked like he seems physically 100 percent. Right. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1037.08s)]
*  And then that's where it usually hurts you. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1041.1599999999999s)]
*  But yeah, he could not he could not get it. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1043.04s)]
*  I didn't know what I was looking at. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1045.48s)]
*  I was like, is it raining in there? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1046.92s)]
*  Is it like it looked like a bad weather game, too? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1048.8s)]
*  I just hadn't seen him like that. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1051.36s)]
*  I don't know. I don't count that Tampa Bay game like when they lost [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1053.24s)]
*  in the Super Bowl to Tampa Bay, you were like, oh, well, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1056.32s)]
*  that game was ugly for a couple of quarters. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1058.84s)]
*  And yeah, they had the Andy Reid thing that happened a couple of days [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1061.2s)]
*  for this family. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1063.96s)]
*  And it's just the whole vibe of that game was off. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1064.96s)]
*  This was different. This was he was specifically missing guys. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1066.8799999999999s)]
*  Like there was that one when he rolled out and he had Hopkins on the third down. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1071.6s)]
*  And I felt like he could have scrambled for 20 yards or just thrown Hopkins [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1075.44s)]
*  a good pass and he did neither and Hopkins dropped it. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1079.84s)]
*  But it was like over and over again. He just sucked. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1082.08s)]
*  Yeah, bizarre. It was like you're like incredulous in the stadium. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1085.04s)]
*  Everyone was like, what's going on? Is he sick? What's happening? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1088.36s)]
*  Your boy was giddy, too. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1091.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I don't think he I think he went like three minutes without talking. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1092.8799999999999s)]
*  Brady, he's just like giggling in the corner. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1096.2s)]
*  Good for him. Well, that's the thing. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1098.6s)]
*  If it had been on my home's his version of 28 to three with Brady announcing, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1099.72s)]
*  that would have been great. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1104.3600000000001s)]
*  Instead, this is probably the best moment of Brady's career since he retired [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1105.16s)]
*  because it was a lot of my home's my home's my home's. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1109.88s)]
*  Is he the GOAT? I don't know. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1112.64s)]
*  If he gets his three P, Brady's never done that. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1114.0s)]
*  And now he goes down with two Super Bowl blowout losses. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1116.64s)]
*  Brady said zero. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1120.96s)]
*  Brady lost three times in the Super Bowl. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1122.8s)]
*  All one score games where he had the ball on the last drive [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1124.72s)]
*  with a chance to like steal the game. Never got blown out. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1128.44s)]
*  And then and then he beat my home's twice. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1131.28s)]
*  That's it. You know, in the playoffs. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1134.68s)]
*  And it's like, can we fucking settle down now for five years [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1136.2s)]
*  with the my home's GOAT stuff, please? Thank you. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1138.96s)]
*  I think you did by yourself at least three years. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1141.28s)]
*  Five. Yeah. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1144.72s)]
*  Yes. But because I thought like it'd be wins for next year. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1146.2s)]
*  You could make a good case for it. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1150.28s)]
*  But you're not going to like this. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1151.9199999999998s)]
*  I still think his best Super Bowl in terms of grading this legacy [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1153.72s)]
*  versus my home's is the one where he beat my home's. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1157.96s)]
*  Now, that wasn't what the Patriots, I'm sorry to say. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1160.8s)]
*  But I feel like that's his greatest claim. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1163.1599999999999s)]
*  That's his greatest claim to him being better than my home's. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1165.28s)]
*  Is him crushing my home courses. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1168.2s)]
*  His best Super Bowls were the Seahawks one and the Falcons. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1170.24s)]
*  Those were those are the ones that come back. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1174.68s)]
*  But then that Seahawks game being down 10, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1177.6399999999999s)]
*  those two drives that he had against Seattle, that was outrageous. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1179.72s)]
*  Well, I'm saying in terms of comparing them to my home's, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1182.6399999999999s)]
*  I think you have to do the head to head. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1185.2s)]
*  But I know he's beat him in the three. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1186.72s)]
*  Pete was the only thing my home's could have done. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1188.32s)]
*  That surpassed anything Brady did. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1191.44s)]
*  So now, you know, my home's is going to it's about to hit his 30s. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1193.96s)]
*  Yeah, he's got he's three and two in the Super Bowl. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1197.48s)]
*  And the thing about the Super Bowl is it's really hard to actually win the Super Bowl. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1199.6s)]
*  Yeah, Brady made it 10 times. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1203.32s)]
*  He went seven and three easily could have been three and seven. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1204.52s)]
*  He's they could have been 10 and oh, you know, but but my home's three and two. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1207.44s)]
*  So we'll see, because Kelsey, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1211.24s)]
*  I think, you know, if they had won the Super Bowl, would Kelsey have retired? [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1214.12s)]
*  I would have bet yes. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1217.56s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what happens with that now. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1218.92s)]
*  Chris Jones getting older. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1220.88s)]
*  When we talked about hitting the drafts, they hit that McDuffie, Carlisle, this draft [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1223.16s)]
*  looks like they hit the worthy pick, but the offensive line is like really rough. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1226.92s)]
*  There's other teams coming. The Chargers are going to be better. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1231.8000000000002s)]
*  We saw Tyreek Hill on Friday. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1234.72s)]
*  I was trying to get him to come to the Pats wasn't happening, but it [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1237.2s)]
*  there was there was a. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1240.92s)]
*  Are you going to tell him what he said afterwards? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1241.96s)]
*  What do you say after? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1244.0800000000002s)]
*  I said, come to the Cowboys. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1245.1200000000001s)]
*  And then he did the eyes thing like I'm looking at you. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1246.84s)]
*  I said, you may have to be all running back to. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1249.32s)]
*  He's like, that's all right. I'm ready. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1251.12s)]
*  So here we go. That is good news for Dallas. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1252.6s)]
*  Well, and then somebody that was with them was like, watch out for the Chargers [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1254.6s)]
*  and walked off. I said, what do you mean? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1257.6s)]
*  Can we bet this? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1259.6799999999998s)]
*  I will say, though, but everyone's going to call the division. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1261.8s)]
*  The coaches are so great in the division, you know, for the in the West look out. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1265.04s)]
*  There's still four games better than any of those team. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1269.6s)]
*  There's still a month better than the Chargers. Right. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1271.8s)]
*  So, you know, they're not going away anytime soon. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1274.52s)]
*  I don't think the Chiefs, as far as Brady goes, if you were in a coma for a year [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1277.52s)]
*  and you came out of it and you said, how is Brady? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1281.32s)]
*  And I would have told you, oh, my God, he had his best year ever. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1284.72s)]
*  He he he took a gigantic leap ahead of Patrick Mahomes. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1287.32s)]
*  You like it. What do you mean by doing nothing? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1291.88s)]
*  So, yeah, he was a C plus in the booth, but this was his best year ever. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1294.24s)]
*  He somehow bought a majority stake of the [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1297.64s)]
*  bought a majority of Vegas for 10 million bucks. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1300.04s)]
*  He owns a team. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1303.24s)]
*  The goat again. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1304.4s)]
*  The goat almost got taken over. Now he's back. Right. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1305.48s)]
*  I thank you for calling him a C plus in the booth, by the way. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1308.84s)]
*  Is that generous? Yeah. Yeah. That's a good teacher. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1311.96s)]
*  I didn't. So tell me about this broadcast and Brady and how he was talking [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1314.72s)]
*  about Mahomes and was there anything interesting? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1319.32s)]
*  Because I was just laughing the whole time. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1322.0s)]
*  I thought it was embarrassing. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1324.08s)]
*  It was like pointing and laughing. They cut away to him. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1325.2s)]
*  Now, I thought he was just fine. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1327.88s)]
*  You know, I'm not one to watch a lot, but there are no I have like 44 beds. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1330.48s)]
*  I'm not kidding. I like 44 beds and I'm constantly checking on them throughout. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1335.44s)]
*  But he was fine. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1339.2s)]
*  And he was like, sometimes this happens. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1340.2s)]
*  And it seemed like he blamed the line and praised the Eagles, which he should have [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1342.08s)]
*  defensively more than getting on the home's case. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1347.24s)]
*  Their defense was their D backs were great. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1350.32s)]
*  They broke up that fourth and three that that guy broke on him perfectly. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1353.32s)]
*  Yeah, I was I was thinking about it from a Pats perspective, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1357.12s)]
*  because just trying to figure out because they must have this blank slate [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1360.72s)]
*  for how to put together a team now, right? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1363.2s)]
*  Because they have the coach and the QB. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1364.8799999999999s)]
*  They have basically nothing else except Christian Gonzalez. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1366.2s)]
*  Barmorf comes back and it's like, how would you build this team? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1369.24s)]
*  And it really feels like you just spend everything on the lines. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1372.76s)]
*  You can figure out everything else after. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1376.36s)]
*  So there's that that Mason Graham, the Michigan defensive tackle. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1378.2s)]
*  And it's like, let's just get that guy. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1381.48s)]
*  Maybe he can be Jalen Carter and just push the line like that. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1382.68s)]
*  But it would seem like the sweet spot would just be having these four guys [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1385.32s)]
*  that can just push the pocket and then you don't have to blitz. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1389.8s)]
*  You don't have to do any of this gimmick shit. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1393.04s)]
*  And then you can kind of patch together. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1395.08s)]
*  Everything else would be one. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1396.72s)]
*  How about the other part of the line? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1398.12s)]
*  The one that Saquon ran for over 2000 yards. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1399.56s)]
*  Right. They have that going with the Giants. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1401.8799999999999s)]
*  Like it's just it makes a world of difference. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1404.04s)]
*  If you could figure it out, you know, you don't turn the ball over as much [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1406.32s)]
*  when you own both lines. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1409.24s)]
*  You win time of possession by 13, 14 minutes in the Super Bowl. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1410.48s)]
*  That's a pretty good thing. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1414.4s)]
*  When the Dolphins, they spend half of their salary cap on two and the two receivers. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1415.76s)]
*  That's like, what do you how's this going to play out? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1420.72s)]
*  I thought the Chiefs fan base, I got to be honest and I'm sure [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1424.48s)]
*  I say this knowing this will immediately be thrown back at my face [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1428.24s)]
*  with because the Patriots fans did the same thing. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1431.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, just needed a maybe a 16 ounce cup of settled down juice. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1434.1200000000001s)]
*  Oh, there is the chess were out. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1439.24s)]
*  The chess were out this weekend. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1441.2s)]
*  I'll just there's a there was a lot of confidence, rightly so, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1442.68s)]
*  because they had the best guy in the league and they win every one of these [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1445.24s)]
*  games down the stretch. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1448.24s)]
*  And it was a fan base that maybe needed their version of what happened [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1449.48s)]
*  to the Pats and 07 and what happened to the Pats and the Nick Foles, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1454.0800000000002s)]
*  Doug Peterson, Super Bowl and some other great teams where sometimes you [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1457.2s)]
*  should tell John, you should have told him to calm down. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1461.0800000000002s)]
*  So he was introducing the starters before the game. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1463.68s)]
*  I'm saying it's like, yeah, relax. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1466.3200000000002s)]
*  I'll never do that again. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1468.24s)]
*  They can't have him back. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1469.64s)]
*  I'm a Rams fan for like 40 years. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1471.04s)]
*  He says he hasn't got that St. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1473.6399999999999s)]
*  Louis, Kansas City thing. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1475.28s)]
*  No, he's he was with the Rams when they moved. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1476.6399999999999s)]
*  He jumped to the Chiefs. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1478.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1480.76s)]
*  Has anyone have we litigated that? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1481.8s)]
*  Do we need to have him on the podcast or really like what's going on here? [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1483.32s)]
*  I'm sure, you know, come on, you'll get lost in his eyes and you'll be like, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1487.12s)]
*  all right, that's good enough. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1491.08s)]
*  Excuse. So handsome. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1492.24s)]
*  Yeah. Can we talk about. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1493.68s)]
*  Have you ever seen anything like how bad my homes was in this game [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1497.2s)]
*  from a great player standpoint? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1501.0s)]
*  I was rocking my brain because there was so much dead time during this game. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1502.92s)]
*  I was like taking notes of my it wasn't expected to take this many notes. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1505.96s)]
*  But like I was thinking like magic in the 1984 NBA final. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1509.48s)]
*  Sorry, I had to work the NBA in. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1513.28s)]
*  But magic like just sucked in the finals. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1514.8400000000001s)]
*  Like he cost them a couple of games. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1516.8s)]
*  He wasn't quite magic yet, though. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1518.0800000000002s)]
*  They won the 80 and 82 titles. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1519.44s)]
*  But he wasn't like he's the best player in the league. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1521.88s)]
*  Peyton Manning had that New Orleans Super Bowl where he threw the pick six. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1525.0400000000002s)]
*  And he was kind of the he was either the best player in the league [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1528.92s)]
*  or one of the best players. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1531.72s)]
*  Yeah. But I can't really remember somebody who was like this guy. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1533.44s)]
*  Everyone agrees is the best player in the league and he's in his prime. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1536.8400000000001s)]
*  Sucking this badly. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1541.68s)]
*  It was almost like it was like a Greg Norman golf major type of type of performance. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1543.48s)]
*  Like the amount of throws that he missed and how frazzled he seemed. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1548.72s)]
*  And then they're doing the stats at halftime. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1552.72s)]
*  And this is the one of the 10 worst EPA's of the last 50. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1554.84s)]
*  All that shit. It's like, oh, my God, this is the best guy in the league. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1558.44s)]
*  This doesn't happen ever. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1561.12s)]
*  Well, I'm trying to think what we're I mean, you know, you can go like [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1563.28s)]
*  Clayton Kershaw and everything, but I'm not about sure about the one game. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1566.04s)]
*  I mean, I was thinking Kobe's six by 24, the first three quarters of that Celtic game [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1570.48s)]
*  when it just seemed like he couldn't hit anything. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1575.36s)]
*  And it was like they won. He came back. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1577.84s)]
*  You want to tell everybody they want? [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1580.48s)]
*  Yeah, they did win. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1581.84s)]
*  I'm trying. Cam Newton won MVP that year. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1583.24s)]
*  Denver, we never thought Cam Newton was the best guy. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1586.28s)]
*  He was MVP. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1589.32s)]
*  I know. But nobody was like Cam Newton is the road ghost or Cam Newton. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1590.84s)]
*  It was like he had a great season. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1594.28s)]
*  No, I get it. I get it. Yeah. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1595.56s)]
*  I don't know. I guess like Montana against the Giants one year [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1597.56s)]
*  when they knocked him out, but he got knocked out. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1601.48s)]
*  If you count the Super Bowls, I think you're I think this is the best case. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1604.32s)]
*  I mean, in the 70s, everyone threw for 125 yards, either one or lost. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1608.88s)]
*  So Elway had some bad ones right before he won. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1613.04s)]
*  He did, but it always felt like his teams were so overmatched. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1617.84s)]
*  This was one where I felt like the plays were there. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1621.44s)]
*  I know their pass rush was good, but he was also missing everything he did. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1623.68s)]
*  He's missing open guys. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1627.48s)]
*  And it was one of those things that almost became like the Luka trade [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1630.0s)]
*  where you start texting people in the second quarter like, is he hurt? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1633.4s)]
*  What's going on with my homes? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1637.56s)]
*  Is there something wrong? Is he sick? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1639.2s)]
*  What does he have? I've never seen anything like this. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1641.68s)]
*  So yeah, I'm looking at all of them now. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1643.4s)]
*  I really don't think Carolina scored 10. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1646.0s)]
*  When you say Manning against Seattle, is that what you're saying? [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1649.6s)]
*  No, Manning against Pate Manning against New Orleans [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1652.04s)]
*  when he threw the pick six to lose the game. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1654.24s)]
*  But it wasn't like he was like horrific the entire game. Right. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1656.12s)]
*  You know, Brady's had Brady had some bad [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1659.64s)]
*  playoff losses, like we had a bad loss to the Ravens. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1662.44s)]
*  There was a weird Denver Broncos game after the third Super Bowl [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1666.76s)]
*  they won when he wasn't great, but never anything like this. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1669.72s)]
*  Where you go playoff, maybe pick some off. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1672.44s)]
*  But Super Bowl is like the big game. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1675.28s)]
*  If it's down to one game, this is tough. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1676.84s)]
*  I mean, Jim Kelly was great and had some bad ones, but this was a class by itself. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1679.16s)]
*  I'm shocked at this. I really am. I'm like, you know, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1684.32s)]
*  I know we were due for a bad one. Right. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1687.48s)]
*  We had we had three three point games in a row. Is that right? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1689.68s)]
*  Yeah. And then the Tampa, Kansas City was the last bad one. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1692.92s)]
*  Four years ago. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1696.6000000000001s)]
*  But it just makes me sadder because the season's ending [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1697.64s)]
*  and it ends on a when it ends on a dud like that. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1700.88s)]
*  I know it's harder to take. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1703.16s)]
*  Well, I'm sure there's going to be a bunch of pieces [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1705.2s)]
*  the next two days trying to put this performance in perspective. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1707.3200000000002s)]
*  Historically. Yeah. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1711.16s)]
*  At least from a football standpoint, they'll have stats. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1712.72s)]
*  So and what he did in the last two drives will kind of fuck it up a little bit [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1715.24s)]
*  because it'll make it seem like it was better than it is. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1719.64s)]
*  So you almost have to do like the first three quarters. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1721.5600000000002s)]
*  Guys, what is the equivalent in other sports of somebody who's fallen behind? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1725.28s)]
*  Forty Tom Brady, Tom, you're going to compare him to Tom Brady. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1729.52s)]
*  He you start calling compare him to Marsha Brady. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1733.24s)]
*  How about that? How about we start there? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1736.24s)]
*  And flying. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1739.08s)]
*  I don't want to hear about Patrick Bones again. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1740.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't want to hear about it again. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1743.32s)]
*  That's it. We're done with the gold. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1745.56s)]
*  That's it. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1747.92s)]
*  I don't want to hear it. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1749.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm done. Get it out. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1750.92s)]
*  OK, OK, Stephen, we're done. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1752.6s)]
*  We're done. I'm sorry. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1755.1999999999998s)]
*  I wasn't even doing Stephen, a generic network network [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1756.1999999999998s)]
*  ex athlete guy. All right. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1759.9199999999998s)]
*  I was doing 20 of them. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1761.1999999999998s)]
*  Now, I'm sure Stephen Aile would not be kind of mobs. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1763.36s)]
*  I have some silver linings for the chiefs now. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1766.56s)]
*  Hey, real quick, what was it when I left New Orleans, I left on Saturday. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1768.8799999999999s)]
*  We were sad to see you go. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1773.56s)]
*  Felt like 7030 Eagles fans. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1774.9599999999998s)]
*  What was it in the building? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1777.56s)]
*  Half and half. Really? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1778.9599999999998s)]
*  A lot of chiefs fans. Yeah, a lot. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1780.52s)]
*  Oh, it didn't sound that way. Wow. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1782.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it was the Eagles fans were just louder. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1784.48s)]
*  Silver linings for the chiefs. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1788.44s)]
*  I think Kelsey comes back now. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1791.1599999999999s)]
*  I don't think he retires on that game. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1792.8799999999999s)]
*  One more year for him. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1794.72s)]
*  Another dumb narrative that we got killed on. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1796.32s)]
*  What did he have to for 24? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1798.28s)]
*  We had some I think he might add a third catch in there. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1800.12s)]
*  Another silver lining. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1803.52s)]
*  We could talk about them normally again. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1805.56s)]
*  Yeah, they're not Michael Myers anymore. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1808.04s)]
*  You can't do it anymore. We can't do the. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1809.72s)]
*  I know there's 17 reasons to pick this other team, but it's the chiefs. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1812.24s)]
*  Like that's done. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1816.28s)]
*  We can now talk about football games rationally normally without these [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1817.64s)]
*  fucking weird fear of this team. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1821.36s)]
*  Pat Riley doesn't make any money. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1824.28s)]
*  I think that's great. Terrible 2025 Pat Riley. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1825.72s)]
*  Brady wasn't that popular as an announcer. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1830.24s)]
*  I think that was a win for the chiefs. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1832.76s)]
*  Wait, what? Why? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1835.92s)]
*  I don't know. I'm just throwing that in there. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1836.96s)]
*  These are silver linings. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1839.0s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1840.24s)]
*  They didn't trade Luca Donchich in the last 10 days. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1841.84s)]
*  They didn't trade my homes for Anthony Davis at a number one [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1845.88s)]
*  and then have Davis get in his first game right after they gave an interview [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1848.56s)]
*  about how smart they were because they want guys who were in shape. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1853.4s)]
*  But then mentioned Shaq is one of the guys, the great guys historically [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1856.0s)]
*  who stayed in shape Shaq, like famously never in shape ever. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1859.56s)]
*  At any point in his career, that was hilarious. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1863.32s)]
*  I have no more silver linings unless you can think of any. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1866.0s)]
*  I don't think there are any for the chiefs. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1868.24s)]
*  Yeah, not too many, except that maybe they could stun us again. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1870.76s)]
*  Right. So it wasn't even this year. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1874.6000000000001s)]
*  It was last year when they did it all on the road that we were like, right. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1876.24s)]
*  Oh, crap. Oh, they're back and they're a beast and they're better than ever. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1879.56s)]
*  I don't know if you want to look at next year's lines yet, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1884.88s)]
*  or if we say that to the end or. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1887.24s)]
*  No, I want to. I want to do that next segment. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1889.04s)]
*  I know. So if I'm the chiefs, if I'm the PR, if I'm the Lewis K of the chiefs. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1890.8s)]
*  Oh, and, you know, in my spare time when I'm not just focused on. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1895.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, my three clients that I care about and I spend [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1902.36s)]
*  barely any time with the other ones. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1905.16s)]
*  Wait, if you're the Lewis, that means the chiefs are going to get canceled [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1907.2s)]
*  in like three weeks. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1910.08s)]
*  No, the Lewis K of the chiefs. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1911.04s)]
*  So this is so Jimmy would be the chiefs of this scenario, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1913.68s)]
*  because that'd be a client who would actually care about unlike some of the others. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1917.24s)]
*  I'm spinning it. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1922.28s)]
*  We were never that good the whole time. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1924.12s)]
*  It was amazing. We got there. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1926.1999999999998s)]
*  Like, look at our record. You saw us in the Super Bowl. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1928.4399999999998s)]
*  We played an awesome team. We couldn't hold that. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1931.6399999999999s)]
*  We had no offensive line. We had no explosive playmakers. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1934.36s)]
*  Our coaching staff is old. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1938.84s)]
*  Like, it's a fucking miracle we made the Super Bowl. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1940.36s)]
*  We should be getting kudos for that. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1942.6399999999999s)]
*  Interesting. That would be my spin. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1945.1999999999998s)]
*  That's what that's what a publicist is supposed to say. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1946.4399999999998s)]
*  My client actually sucks. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1948.56s)]
*  No, it's just be like, no, maybe you should spin it the other way. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1950.6399999999999s)]
*  We were pretty good. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1953.08s)]
*  We're proud of the season we had just making the Super Bowl as an achievement. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1954.28s)]
*  Yeah. We made five Super Bowls. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1957.8s)]
*  Your Patriots won like the first three Super Bowls by a field goal, right? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1960.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1964.56s)]
*  So that's what we were thinking. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1965.9199999999998s)]
*  But then they came back. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1967.52s)]
*  Tom Brady showed up for Super Bowl. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1968.12s)]
*  So unlike Magic Mahomes, he hasn't shown up for two. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1969.28s)]
*  We are fucking back. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1971.6399999999999s)]
*  Drake May, Mike Brayboy, Tom Brady is the goat. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1973.4399999999998s)]
*  We're back. Fuck you, chiefs. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1975.8s)]
*  Don't you dare call Mahomes the goat. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1978.32s)]
*  He's not the goat. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1981.3999999999999s)]
*  Take it back. Go to Allen. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1983.12s)]
*  All right. So some gambling stuff from this game. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1985.84s)]
*  We mentioned the Hertz Anytime TD first touchdown scorer. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1987.88s)]
*  We had a. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1991.08s)]
*  Coop had a pick six. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1992.72s)]
*  Yeah. What were the odds on the pick six? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1995.36s)]
*  Do we know that we had like 30 to one right? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=1997.48s)]
*  For those 15 for I saw 15 that there was a pick six [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2000.8s)]
*  and then it was like 30 or 35 for the Eagles. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2005.52s)]
*  I think I saw that. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2008.48s)]
*  So, yeah, that was amazing. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2009.72s)]
*  Although we saw a few in the playoffs. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2012.0s)]
*  Was that the greatest moment ever for a white defensive back? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2014.32s)]
*  Or do we have to go to the 60s? [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2018.56s)]
*  Do we have to go to Paul Krause? [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2020.9599999999998s)]
*  Paul Krause of the Minnesota Vikings? [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2022.6399999999999s)]
*  Did he do anything? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2024.3999999999999s)]
*  Cowboys had a guy named Charlie Waters who did well. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2025.56s)]
*  Oh, Charlie Waters. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2028.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's it, though. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2029.8s)]
*  I think that really is. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2031.76s)]
*  Don't worry about comparing Mahomes to their bad performances ever. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2033.1999999999998s)]
*  We would need the white defensive back. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2037.0s)]
*  White guys in Black History Month. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2038.8s)]
*  Did Jason Zihour never do this? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2041.24s)]
*  No, he was in that good team, right? [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2043.24s)]
*  That couple on the Ravens. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2046.84s)]
*  Yeah, that was it. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2048.84s)]
*  Yeah. So at one point in this game. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2050.84s)]
*  Mahomes was this was a. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2054.52s)]
*  Four forty nine left in the second quarter. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2057.24s)]
*  And it's 17 nothing. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2060.68s)]
*  And the Chiefs go two terrible runs, Mahomes sacked. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2062.48s)]
*  And now they're giving the ball back to the Eagles again. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2065.56s)]
*  Mahomes was five for 10 for 24 yards. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2067.88s)]
*  A pick six and three sacks. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2070.6s)]
*  And this is 25 minutes into the game. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2073.44s)]
*  It was just shocking. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2075.4s)]
*  Yeah. So we were looking. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2077.4s)]
*  How many over the years? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2079.7999999999997s)]
*  How many times when the Chiefs are losing, do we text each other? [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2080.8399999999997s)]
*  The Chiefs live line, right? [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2083.44s)]
*  Stays are dead. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2085.6s)]
*  We needed them to get a first down in the end of the second quarter. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2086.4s)]
*  Like, we are going to see some life out of them before we even consider it. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2089.0s)]
*  Thank God they didn't give us that opportunity. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2092.4s)]
*  Well, so. Five for 10 for 24 yards. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2095.3199999999997s)]
*  And then we get to halftime and it's not much better. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2099.8s)]
*  He misses Hopkins on that third and 11. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2102.52s)]
*  So he ended 21 for 32 for 257 with three touchdowns. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2104.8s)]
*  He hit every over and I'm sitting there. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2110.52s)]
*  So this is my bad beat gambling story. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2113.16s)]
*  So a million dollar picks. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2115.6s)]
*  My biggest bet was Chiefs minus one and a half. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2116.6s)]
*  That was for 500 fake. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2118.8s)]
*  And then the second bet was a par. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2121.04s)]
*  Yeah. Well, it's fake. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2123.64s)]
*  I don't even know. OK. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2124.76s)]
*  Second bet was this 250 K parlay. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2125.92s)]
*  Eagles, eight and a half. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2129.7200000000003s)]
*  Mahomes, 200 plus passing yards. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2131.7200000000003s)]
*  And I'm rude. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2135.16s)]
*  And there's a third leg that I'll get to. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2135.8s)]
*  So the 200 plus passing yards seem inconceivable. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2137.8s)]
*  And then they start having these garbage time drives. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2141.0s)]
*  And when they scored the second touchdown and he had like 187, 193, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2143.76s)]
*  they're inside the 15 yard line. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2149.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm going nuts in the suite. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2151.28s)]
*  Like, oh, he's going to get it. He's going to get it. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2153.64s)]
*  He gets it. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2155.12s)]
*  The Eagles go three and out and the Chiefs. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2156.3199999999997s)]
*  And now I'm hustling back to the pod. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2159.2s)]
*  The Chiefs get the all time garbage time touchdown to worthy. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2161.12s)]
*  And it gets to 62. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2165.12s)]
*  The third leg of my parlay was under 60 and a half. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2166.3199999999997s)]
*  And the final score is 40 and 22. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2170.2799999999997s)]
*  They scored two touchdowns in the last four minutes to fucking beat. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2172.56s)]
*  So I lost that one, too. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2176.2799999999997s)]
*  I think I had a losing year for a billion dollar picks [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2177.56s)]
*  because of that last touchdown. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2179.68s)]
*  So the Chiefs just sticking it to me every way. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2181.4s)]
*  I love that these you're with these vandal executives. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2183.84s)]
*  They're watching through their fingers because the hurts touchdown. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2187.2400000000002s)]
*  They're losing tens of millions of dollars. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2190.4s)]
*  I'm losing 500,000 fake dollars. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2193.7200000000003s)]
*  But yeah, here. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2197.36s)]
*  Well, you know, House took a shot. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2199.76s)]

*  And I'm proud of you for making us get out. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2243.84s)]

*  Oh, my God. Three of us. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2253.2400000000002s)]
*  I think I think I was like three out of 15 and but House [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2254.8s)]
*  lost like almost every hand. I don't know how he did. Yeah. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2258.68s)]
*  He was like, you're letting us leave. This is great. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2261.2400000000002s)]
*  Like a lot of times I would go to the ATM. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2263.72s)]
*  I'm like, how many times I have to go to the ATMs? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2265.4s)]
*  Am I is Bill? [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2267.84s)]
*  Am I going to lose his friendship if I don't sit and lose more money with him? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2268.76s)]
*  But anyway, so we lose the leave the Blackjack table. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2271.6800000000003s)]
*  House goes to the ATM. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2274.6000000000004s)]
*  He's got like a new card or something. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2276.76s)]
*  It doesn't let him take money out. So he has to cash advance. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2278.6800000000003s)]
*  So he's not getting the twelve dollar VIG that you would normally get on [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2281.36s)]
*  three hundred dollars to take out. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2284.84s)]
*  It was three hundred and forty four dollars. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2286.2400000000002s)]
*  He had to take it and he had to wait on the long cashier line [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2288.0800000000004s)]
*  to get that money out. Now he had to show his slip. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2291.2000000000003s)]
*  And then he doesn't even gamble with us. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2293.96s)]
*  He didn't gamble. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2297.68s)]
*  Never. So we end up at a craps table with the fantasy football guys. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2299.08s)]
*  He got VIG'd out. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2304.2s)]
*  He said no. After he lost to the ATM, he said no. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2305.16s)]
*  Like that's responsible gambling. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2308.2s)]
*  I can't even beat the ATM. I'm out. I'm not playing. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2310.0s)]
*  But for some reason, paid them 40 extra dollars. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2313.8799999999997s)]
*  Right. Not to gamble. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2316.56s)]
*  Yeah. So he ended up at a craps table with Craig and Danny [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2318.6s)]
*  Danny from the Ringer Fantasy Football Show, who were having a great time playing craps. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2323.24s)]
*  And JJ is there. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2327.4799999999996s)]
*  JJ Jadziszewski, host of New York, New York, who's had a couple [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2328.9599999999996s)]
*  and is dialed up to ten. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2333.7999999999997s)]
*  And he was locked in. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2336.72s)]
*  He's yelling at dealers. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2339.08s)]
*  He's he's hitting points going, pay it, pay it. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2341.2s)]
*  Screaming, screaming. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2344.9199999999996s)]
*  And then Raheem comes in also from the Ringer Sunday pregame. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2347.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. And he's not really doing anything. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2351.3199999999997s)]
*  And then all of a sudden he just bets on the don't come line [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2353.72s)]
*  for the shooter across the table because he thinks the guy looks like a bad bet. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2356.6s)]
*  And we're all on the come line, which is like in the poker table [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2360.8s)]
*  for other craps, people listening like y'all want the craps table to be a line [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2363.88s)]
*  betting on the shooter rooting for them. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2367.96s)]
*  Like there's a sweet dynamic that the bops Raheem's just shorting it. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2369.84s)]
*  Basically, guy hits and JJ just gets mad at Raheem, which he should have. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2373.1200000000003s)]
*  Say, don't take sides against the family, Raheem. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2378.36s)]
*  This is indefensible, indefensible, Raheem. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2382.56s)]
*  He's yelling at it. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2386.2s)]
*  And I was like, it is. It's indefensible. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2387.08s)]
*  So Raheem, it's not doing it. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2388.8399999999997s)]
*  So anyway, Raheem became the don't come guy. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2390.3199999999997s)]
*  But we were there. House is there. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2393.24s)]
*  Van is behind us. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2395.12s)]
*  We're all pulling bets together because it's a 50 dollar craps table, which is absurd. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2396.24s)]
*  And we ended up we were there to almost four in the morning. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2400.64s)]
*  We were there. We were down to we started like 600. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2402.7999999999997s)]
*  Right. We were down to 40 bucks in the tin. Right. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2406.56s)]
*  Yeah. Just couldn't get momentum. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2409.7999999999997s)]
*  Built it back up to 1400. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2411.64s)]
*  So that was nice for us. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2413.12s)]
*  And that's really like a million dollar. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2414.32s)]
*  That's real money. Yeah. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2416.0s)]
*  Craig had a nice little run. Yeah. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2417.4s)]
*  And then at the end of the night, I had like I just got on a heater [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2420.04s)]
*  and I just wasn't throwing a seven for like 30 minutes. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2423.28s)]
*  Yeah. Right. But what happens is when you when you start doing one like that [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2426.36s)]
*  and more and more people come over the table and people start betting [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2430.2400000000002s)]
*  and everyone's betting points. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2432.76s)]
*  And it's like three minutes between throws. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2434.28s)]
*  I know that. And he's like, I'm hot. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2437.04s)]
*  Get me the dice back. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2439.04s)]
*  And this guy's like, give me a hard 10, no hard six. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2440.1200000000003s)]
*  Give me two on this. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2442.7999999999997s)]
*  And it's by the time it's so I could I blame the guy at the other side of the table. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2443.7599999999998s)]
*  You know what? I don't. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2448.88s)]
*  I think it's I think it's intentional. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2449.7599999999998s)]
*  I think they slow play it because we were pretty conservative. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2452.04s)]
*  We were playing the pass line. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2455.0s)]
*  Then we were playing behind it and we're playing the cup. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2456.44s)]
*  But if you get bored and they take forever, that's when you're like, shit, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2459.24s)]
*  if I have to wait three minutes between each role, I'm going to play the field. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2462.72s)]
*  I'm going to play a couple more numbers. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2465.6s)]
*  I think that's where they break out. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2467.16s)]
*  You were getting mad because there was a guy on the other end of the table [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2468.4s)]
*  who was pumping his fist because you were hitting every number except ours. Right. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2471.72s)]
*  Right. I probably make 15 grand off of me. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2476.08s)]
*  You know, it's like it's getting crazy. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2478.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Motherfucker, you're icing me and making money for me at the same time. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2480.52s)]
*  Then we finally hit the number. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2484.16s)]
*  And then the best part was there's some bet that the fantasy guys were doing, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2485.8399999999997s)]
*  which is like you can bet eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2489.92s)]
*  And somebody has to hit all five of those numbers before they throw seven. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2493.8399999999997s)]
*  And it's 30 to one odds. It seems inconceivable. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2497.24s)]
*  And I was throwing it for so long, only the 11 was left. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2500.24s)]
*  And then I finally hit the 11 and I've never seen those guys happier. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2503.3999999999996s)]
*  They were like, first of all, they were arm and arm. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2506.7599999999998s)]
*  You should post that. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2510.12s)]
*  I should post that picture on Instagram for like 40 minutes. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2511.72s)]
*  Whenever they weren't rolling, they were like, come on, we could do this. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2514.52s)]
*  They were locked arms together. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2517.0s)]
*  They were like, like when the defensive line is watching somebody [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2519.2799999999997s)]
*  about to attempt the game winning field goal, they had their arms around each other. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2522.72s)]
*  But but literally for an hour. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2526.0s)]
*  Yeah, I love it. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2528.12s)]
*  It was a day. Right. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2529.24s)]
*  That when they were they had a bet. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2530.56s)]
*  I don't know what the bet was, but between the three of them, whoever lost, [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2533.2s)]
*  I think it was like a season long bet, whoever lost had to sit in the middle seat [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2536.9599999999996s)]
*  coming home and they were on my flight and couldn't be entertained, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2539.7599999999998s)]
*  couldn't listen to music, couldn't watch TV, couldn't read a book the whole time. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2543.7599999999998s)]
*  And if they fell asleep, they would just wake them up. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2547.2s)]
*  And Danny was in the middle. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2549.3599999999997s)]
*  They let him watch the map. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2551.04s)]
*  They let him watch the map on the belt. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2552.4799999999996s)]
*  I was like, these guys are good. This is it. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2554.7599999999998s)]
*  That's hilarious. Yeah, it was great. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2556.7999999999997s)]
*  It was a good hang. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2558.68s)]
*  Everybody was in rare form, including Rahim, who was trying to short the table for some reason. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2559.6s)]
*  I'm going to talk to HR about Rahim. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2565.68s)]
*  I might have been an HR violation. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2567.56s)]
*  Yeah, it might have been a little bit. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2569.56s)]
*  JJ was the MVP, though, and he blew out my right ear drum. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2570.92s)]
*  And I was covered in spit by the end of the night. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2574.8399999999997s)]
*  But I loved it. It was great. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2577.3599999999997s)]
*  When he showed up, you turned around to greet him and you were about to roll. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2578.68s)]
*  And so you took the dice over the table. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2582.7999999999997s)]
*  I know, I know, because I got excited. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2585.24s)]
*  I know he was there. That's a dice violation. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2586.72s)]
*  I'm like, oh, and then I'm calling it like an announcer. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2588.4s)]
*  He's got one more dice violation and he's out of here. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2590.32s)]
*  He's going to have to go back to the [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2593.12s)]
*  He'd yell at the dealer and the dealer's like, it's not you're not even rolling. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2600.62s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2606.4s)]
*  I know he had the superstition about same dice. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2607.12s)]
*  I got to say, he really did get the energy going. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2610.2400000000002s)]
*  Screaming, pay it at the dealer. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2613.32s)]
*  You're not going to believe it, but the dealers, they don't they don't love [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2614.96s)]
*  it. Right. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2619.04s)]
*  It's kind of you hit the it's pay it. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2620.12s)]
*  And I have for you, bro. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2623.84s)]
*  Do what you want with this is a dollar. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2625.36s)]
*  So that casino used to be called Harris. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2627.6800000000003s)]
*  And I guess technically still is. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2630.28s)]
*  But now it's the Caesars. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2631.6800000000003s)]
*  But I've had I think of the most fun gambling moments of my life. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2632.76s)]
*  I for some reason, at least five or six of them have been. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2637.92s)]
*  It's just my favorite place to probably play blackjack or craps. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2640.8s)]
*  The dealers are all nice. They're all they're all from here. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2644.76s)]
*  They seem like they are. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2647.16s)]
*  And they're just like they move at a pace that you feel like they're not just [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2648.04s)]
*  trying to rush you out. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2651.48s)]
*  It seems like they're rooting for you. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2653.3999999999996s)]
*  Like when you bet for them, they really appreciate it. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2654.64s)]
*  And I always really enjoyed it. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2656.7999999999997s)]
*  It's right in the middle of downtown. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2659.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't even like just walk to where you're going. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2661.2s)]
*  I thought it would be packed, by the way. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2663.92s)]
*  I was there the night before. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2665.64s)]
*  We could have sat any blackjack table on Thursday night. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2667.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, they jacked the prices up. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2671.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, but $50 is, you know, in Vegas. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2673.8799999999997s)]
*  That's any Saturday night, right? [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2676.72s)]
*  I guess. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2679.56s)]
*  But it seemed like everything was 50, 100. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2680.96s)]
*  So I think it was it was scaring off people a little bit. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2682.92s)]
*  Any other any other gambling stuff? [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2686.04s)]
*  Jake Elliott was way over on on all his way over points. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2688.96s)]
*  I thought he had a shot at MVP for a minute. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2692.48s)]
*  I mean, he had four extra points and four field goals. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2694.48s)]
*  Wasn't he? He actually had to kick seven field goals, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2697.12s)]
*  but with all the false starts and everything. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2699.64s)]
*  Herd said he was what? [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2703.16s)]
*  Two plus 280. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2704.84s)]
*  Yeah, plus 280. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2706.16s)]
*  But hurts most rushing yards was like six to one, I think. Right. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2707.3599999999997s)]
*  Oh, did that hit? [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2711.92s)]
*  Yeah, he had 72. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2713.16s)]
*  Barkley had 57. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2715.24s)]
*  And then Mahomes at 25, like that was the highest on the Chiefs. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2716.8799999999997s)]
*  So that triple crown bet that I stayed away from because it seemed [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2720.8399999999997s)]
*  like just a trap, it seemed like impossible to hit all three. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2725.0s)]
*  It ended up being Mahomes passing [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2728.48s)]
*  Xavier worthy receiving and hurts rushing. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2732.24s)]
*  So I wonder what that must have been like 20 to one. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2736.24s)]
*  I have no idea. What are the odds of that? [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2738.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, at least. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2740.72s)]
*  Yeah. Where they had probably like the sixth or seventh best thoughts. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2742.52s)]
*  Triple crown bet. That was bizarre. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2745.3599999999997s)]
*  I can't recommend it. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2747.3199999999997s)]
*  We both had hurts touchdown, right? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2748.3999999999996s)]
*  I mean, I guess that's good that we did that. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2750.3599999999997s)]
*  I don't want to talk out of school, but [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2753.3999999999996s)]
*  I wouldn't call the fan duo guys elated that the game went over. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2756.3599999999997s)]
*  No. I wouldn't say there was high fiving in the suite. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2760.3199999999997s)]
*  And the Mahomes yardage props going up, I wouldn't. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2763.12s)]
*  I wouldn't say that was a high five special either. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2765.64s)]
*  No way. The Kelsey and Barkley stuff. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2768.08s)]
*  They told me and I said this a million dollar picks that the [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2770.96s)]
*  the most one sided bet of the week from a prop standpoint was Barkley [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2774.08s)]
*  to score a touchdown. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2778.04s)]
*  Oh, really? All right. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2779.04s)]
*  Ninety nine point nine percent of the bets were on it. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2780.04s)]
*  And the no TD was plus 150. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2783.04s)]
*  And they were like it was like zero dollars on it or like seven dollars [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2785.56s)]
*  or something. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2788.56s)]
*  It was like zero dollars on it or like seven dollars or something. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2789.68s)]
*  You know, the end up getting it. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2792.88s)]
*  It's his birthday on Sunday thing. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2795.04s)]
*  Picked up steam like somewhere around Friday. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2797.24s)]
*  I was like, I don't think that matters. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2799.92s)]
*  I really don't. I think if he scores three touchdowns, I don't think [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2802.16s)]
*  we have to say it's because he turned 28 today. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2805.2s)]
*  There's nothing to do with it. I think that's fair, especially it's not [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2808.08s)]
*  like it's like a major birthday. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2810.72s)]
*  It's like, oh, cool. 28. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2812.12s)]
*  How do we feel about any other betting stuff that you wanted to hit? [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2814.48s)]
*  What was going on at the Super Bowl party? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2817.2s)]
*  Yellow was plus 280. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2819.08s)]
*  Tales for the coin toss. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2821.88s)]
*  Tales for the coin toss. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2824.44s)]
*  Let's get rid of the anthem betting because it went over, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2826.36s)]
*  but they're grading it under, I think, because because he said [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2830.56s)]
*  he repeated a line three times. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2836.6800000000003s)]
*  Like just for flair, just to show off, he said the land of the free [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2840.28s)]
*  because he bet the over at the end of the land, the land of the whatever [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2843.12s)]
*  was he did. Why didn't that count? [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2847.48s)]
*  That was his performance. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2848.96s)]
*  I don't know. You can't do that. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2849.84s)]
*  Well, you can't like sing the song and then add where you can't launch [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2851.16s)]
*  into American pie like halfway through the song. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2854.2000000000003s)]
*  It's how long the performances was two hours, two minutes and whatever. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2856.28s)]
*  You can't pay. And then, of course, it was closed and they cut to the fighter [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2860.36s)]
*  jets and you never know when the word brave ends because it's loud. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2863.2000000000003s)]
*  But I don't want to hear ever again that John Batiste is the national anthem [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2866.2000000000003s)]
*  goat. Get that shit out of here. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2870.12s)]
*  Was Mahomes listening to the anthem? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2872.88s)]
*  I don't know. I don't think so. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2875.04s)]
*  Was he thrown up by the anthem? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2877.2799999999997s)]
*  Because there's no other excuse. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2879.12s)]
*  John Batiste held the ball, would hold the note longer than Mahomes [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2882.12s)]
*  could hold the ball. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2886.72s)]
*  I have that Patrick Mahomes. Get out of here. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2888.0s)]
*  Just get out. You got to leave the nightclub. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2890.4799999999996s)]
*  You're out. Oh, shit. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2893.08s)]
*  Well, Mahomes hit all the overs. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2896.24s)]
*  He hit his touchdown over. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2897.7999999999997s)]
*  Did he hit? How many rushes did he have? [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2900.04s)]
*  Because that was another one. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2902.7599999999998s)]
*  He needed five and a half. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2903.9199999999996s)]
*  Shit. So he didn't hit any of the rushing stuff. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2905.48s)]
*  I know we were counting on the kneel downs. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2908.56s)]
*  You know, that's that's an underrated aspect of the game that we didn't talk about. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2911.08s)]
*  Like we could we could kill Mahomes, but they had 24 yards rushing outside [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2914.6s)]
*  of what he did. You could get him a running back at some point. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2919.04s)]
*  Hunt three for nine, Pacheco three for seven. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2922.92s)]
*  That was like one of the reasons I loved all the Mahomes overs [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2925.56s)]
*  when I was playing in the game out of my head was I didn't think the chiefs [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2928.48s)]
*  are going to be able to run the ball. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2931.2400000000002s)]
*  And it turned out they didn't think so either because they they started [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2932.36s)]
*  the game and they basically threw the ball every down, it seemed like. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2935.32s)]
*  And they were trying to keep the seven carries outside of Mahomes. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2937.96s)]
*  Yeah, didn't work. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2942.44s)]
*  Did you have Matt Arisa punting for over three hundred and ten yards? [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2943.6400000000003s)]
*  No, no, I did not. Was that even a bet? [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2948.56s)]
*  They had a total number of. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2952.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think they did. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2954.32s)]
*  I think they did. So it's a pretty good one. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2955.56s)]
*  Wait, how many did he have? He had six points. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2958.36s)]
*  Yeah, three, six months for three. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2960.1600000000003s)]
*  Eleven. Yeah. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2961.52s)]
*  And then your game, man. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2963.2400000000002s)]
*  Ellie, it's 50 yard field goal. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2965.2s)]
*  Oh, you had people in the suite were congratulating me on your behalf [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2968.3999999999996s)]
*  that you the Devante Smith, that long. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2972.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2974.48s)]
*  That was one of your favorite props. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2975.56s)]
*  Twenty half. Yeah. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2976.9199999999996s)]
*  I mean, he had killed them. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2977.96s)]
*  He had killed this defense, Spagnola's defense. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2979.24s)]
*  I mean, that's another thing. Spagnola's got to take a hit, too. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2981.9199999999996s)]
*  But yeah, his last three games were average, like ninety five yards against Casey. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2984.24s)]
*  It's tough, though, when when your offense is such dogshit, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2989.3599999999997s)]
*  I think it has to start affecting the defense at some point, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2993.48s)]
*  because the defense did get a couple of stops and, you know, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2996.44s)]
*  they got the interception when it seemed like the Eagles might be going up 14, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=2999.7999999999997s)]
*  nothing. They got the ball back and then just over and over again. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3003.24s)]
*  They were just getting kicked in the nuts by the offense. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3006.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's unusual. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3008.68s)]
*  Well, it's the saddest time of the season. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3009.96s)]
*  There's no football. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3012.04s)]
*  There's no guest alliance for next week. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3013.24s)]
*  You are guest alliance champion to two legends fell this season. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3014.7599999999998s)]
*  Me and guest alliance. That's right. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3018.3999999999996s)]
*  It was always like, well, Simmons, when it gets to the big moments, [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3021.2400000000002s)]
*  he'll win and Sal's going to lose again. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3024.2000000000003s)]
*  You beat me and then then my homes. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3025.8s)]
*  He got kicked off Goat Island and and the Chiefs are now mortal. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3028.6000000000004s)]
*  And now we can actually talk about them rationally again. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3032.7200000000003s)]
*  And we can talk about the refereeing. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3036.32s)]
*  I was like, it was really getting me mad. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3038.6400000000003s)]
*  You saw like me and Henschen going at it. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3040.0800000000004s)]
*  I'm like, you got mad at Hensch. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3041.84s)]
*  I know, but everybody's got to go crazy with the calls. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3043.2000000000003s)]
*  And it was like, you know, he got brown. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3045.84s)]
*  AJ Brown pass interference. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3048.8s)]
*  He like he hit the guy in the face mask three times. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3050.28s)]
*  Everyone's like that. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3053.84s)]
*  You know, when the boot says, oh, man, I don't know if I call that there. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3055.1600000000003s)]
*  That doesn't mean it was a terrible call. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3059.4s)]
*  Like, why do we have to make that leap from that could have gone either way to, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3061.6000000000004s)]
*  oh, my God, that was the worst call. Oh, it's fixed. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3065.0s)]
*  Calm the hell down, everybody. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3067.88s)]
*  Geez. But at least we don't have to worry about that for a minute. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3069.8s)]
*  I hope. I don't know. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3072.7200000000003s)]
*  It's nice to not have to talk about the referees. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3074.28s)]
*  So we have NFL next year. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3076.6s)]
*  I'm going on. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3079.44s)]
*  Going on Fandel right now. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3082.2799999999997s)]
*  Do you have the odds? [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3083.64s)]
*  I do. OK. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3084.6s)]
*  I want to see if I can. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3086.6s)]
*  Eagles and Chiefs favored. Wow. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3087.88s)]
*  That never happens. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3090.2s)]
*  What? Anything surprise you on those odds? [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3093.2s)]
*  I'm seeing 650 plus 650 for Chiefs and Eagles Raven 7 to 1, [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3095.6s)]
*  Bills 8 to 1, Lions 9. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3099.6s)]
*  Oh, I that Lions 9 and 8. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3102.2s)]
*  I that Lions 9 to 1 and. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3105.2s)]
*  Niners 14 to 1, I'd like to. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3108.64s)]
*  I'll book those bets from people if really they want. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3110.6s)]
*  Yeah, I think those are. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3114.08s)]
*  So we should talk about this with the Chiefs, too. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3115.56s)]
*  I don't think the Chiefs have missed their long term window, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3118.72s)]
*  but I wonder like how much rehab repair they have to do with this nucleus [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3120.8399999999997s)]
*  they have because they have a lot of stuff to fix, but they're also [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3125.16s)]
*  they have money going out in all these different directions. Right. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3127.56s)]
*  You know, it's not like, oh, we need a left tackle. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3130.96s)]
*  Cool. Fucking 12 teams need a left tackle. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3132.76s)]
*  You're not the only one you drafted a left tackle last year [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3135.44s)]
*  at the end of the second round. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3137.7200000000003s)]
*  If you missed on that pick, that's what gets into what we talked about earlier. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3139.28s)]
*  With if you start missing these drafts or missing picks, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3143.28s)]
*  starts to have this cumulative effect so that the stuff that they need, [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3146.5200000000004s)]
*  it's not it's not like you just go to the store and buy it. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3150.28s)]
*  Like everyone wants a left tackle. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3152.76s)]
*  But we talk about the what do we call it? The KCD? [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3154.44s)]
*  Like it's a CD plus 650. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3157.0800000000004s)]
*  You keep pounding it. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3159.48s)]
*  They'll win once in the next six and a half years. Right. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3160.48s)]
*  So that should that should be OK. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3163.32s)]
*  But I also think these other numbers are fair, too. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3165.4s)]
*  Like the Ravens have to be licking their chops a little to the bills at eight to one. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3168.1200000000003s)]
*  Your team. I got scared. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3172.36s)]
*  I thought my team and your team were the same Cowboys. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3174.6000000000004s)]
*  Fifty five. Want to guess the Patriots? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3176.88s)]
*  Don't look. I just looked. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3178.8s)]
*  But tell us anyway. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3180.8s)]
*  Hundred and fifty fourth from the bottom. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3182.4s)]
*  Is that fair? [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3185.2400000000002s)]
*  Ridiculous. I promise you, we won't be the fourth worst team. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3186.7599999999998s)]
*  I love this. I love it. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3189.7999999999997s)]
*  We're going to go 10 and seven next year. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3191.6s)]
*  Wow. Yeah, we're going 10 and seven next year. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3193.48s)]
*  I don't know that for a fact. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3196.12s)]
*  If we hit this is better than Mahomes conclusively, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3197.6s)]
*  it doesn't mean the twenty twenty six Patriots are going to be good. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3201.3199999999997s)]
*  It's not just that Brady's better than Mahomes. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3204.9599999999996s)]
*  Mahomes has to leave. Go Dallas. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3207.9599999999996s)]
*  Get off. Take a hike. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3210.12s)]
*  Get a suitcase and leave. Take your wife with you. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3212.64s)]
*  Take a dad. Take everybody. You're out. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3215.2799999999997s)]
*  You could take a ferry. You could swim back. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3217.56s)]
*  You could jump on a raft. I don't care. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3220.4s)]
*  Get off the island. You're off. Go to Allen. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3222.88s)]
*  You can take that. Kelsey, take her too. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3226.44s)]
*  But just looking at these blindly, Chargers, twenty nine to one jumped out of me. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3232.6s)]
*  Yeah. Commanders, twenty three to one have to be taken seriously [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3236.72s)]
*  because they laid a nice foundation, have a good QB and a good coaching staff [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3240.08s)]
*  and have some stuff that they could do in the off season. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3243.88s)]
*  And then what about the Rams at 30? [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3247.04s)]
*  And I would love what they're selling off guys, though, like they're trading. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3249.56s)]
*  Cooper Cup. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3253.52s)]
*  He got it. He do. He was he wasn't key to their success. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3254.6400000000003s)]

*  I feel like that would be an amazing show. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3600.7599999999998s)]
*  How does he gain steam at four in the morning? [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3602.68s)]
*  Like it's so crazy. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3605.24s)]
*  He, he's like, when you turn the TV up, the volume up and it's just going, and [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3606.4399999999996s)]
*  that's just the volume and never, there was no sign at all of him being tired. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3612.04s)]
*  He w I think he would, he'd still be there if we didn't want to leave. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3615.96s)]
*  The Fandel ring a party was great Friday night. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3618.96s)]
*  We had Megan the stallion and a blink one 82. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3621.24s)]
*  I guess they insist on touring together. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3623.68s)]
*  I don't know what that I know, but yeah, it was, I couldn't believe they played [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3625.52s)]
*  all those songs together too. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3628.12s)]
*  We had, we talked to some fun people. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3629.64s)]
*  We had, I'd never talked to Diana Rossini before. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3631.4s)]
*  And we, we, we talked for like a half hour and she's like seven of your cousins. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3634.28s)]
*  Yeah, she is. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3640.2s)]
*  So it's an honorary member of your family. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3640.88s)]
*  Almost the good ones. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3642.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3643.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3644.1600000000003s)]
*  That I thought she was great. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3644.56s)]
*  I thought the Tyreek Hill announcing his playing for the Cowboys was going to be [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3646.36s)]
*  the highlight, but she was up there too. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3649.2000000000003s)]
*  That was a fun, we talked to some fun people. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3651.2000000000003s)]
*  I got, you know, I've been to a bunch of different super bowlers. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3653.1200000000003s)]
*  I hadn't come in a while. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3655.44s)]
*  There was the one in LA that doesn't count. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3656.6800000000003s)]
*  That was the last, the last Superbowl that wasn't LA that I went to was [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3658.44s)]
*  ironically Raven's Niners. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3661.48s)]
*  I just kind of. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3663.1600000000003s)]
*  It's like, yeah, I hadn't gone, hadn't gone forever. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3664.2400000000002s)]
*  Um, liked watching the game. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3669.32s)]
*  I liked doing the pod with you after the game. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3670.92s)]
*  And I just kind of never, never went, never wanted to go for the Pats after [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3672.7200000000003s)]
*  the second Giants game, cause it was, it was just so emotionally, it's so bad to [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3675.88s)]
*  be there when your team, like I was feeling for the Chiefs fans when you're limping [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3679.96s)]
*  out of, out of the stadium, it's the worst. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3684.44s)]
*  It's and the other half of the people are the happiest and you're just like [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3688.12s)]
*  in fucking sports hell, it's the worst. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3691.88s)]
*  So last time it was in New Orleans, I, you remember I had to do a bit. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3694.1600000000003s)]
*  You had to do the bit. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3698.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3699.1600000000003s)]
*  For a grant. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3699.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3700.36s)]
*  It was a Sal hugs fans of the losing team. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3700.6800000000003s)]
*  And I wasn't quite sure who the losing team was because we had to leave and set [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3703.52s)]
*  up in a good spot before the last drive. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3707.0s)]
*  It was Raven's. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3709.1600000000003s)]
*  Who was it? [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3711.28s)]
*  Raven's 49ers. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3711.6800000000003s)]
*  It was Raven's Niners. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3712.2400000000002s)]
*  That was the blackout game. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3713.48s)]
*  That was Kaepernick. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3714.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3715.76s)]
*  We were first down and goal from the four and they don't score the go ahead [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3715.92s)]
*  touchdown and that game was awesome. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3719.2400000000002s)]
*  Zombies walking out of there. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3720.76s)]
*  Like a lot of people get the fuck away from me. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3722.44s)]
*  I'm not hugging you. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3724.32s)]
*  I don't know who you are. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3725.28s)]
*  Get the cat. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3726.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3726.88s)]
*  So it's a, it's a, it's a big risk going down there. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3727.12s)]
*  Uh, if your team's playing, I mean, chiefs fans must be demoralized tonight. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3730.0s)]
*  Well, the other, so I saw Pat's Rams was the first Superbowl I ever went to, [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3734.48s)]
*  which was like, honestly, one of like the 25 best moments of my life, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3738.48s)]
*  probably that whole day was amazing. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3742.6s)]
*  Um, and then the second game was the blackout game. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3744.68s)]
*  And so when I had a chance to go to this one, I was like, this is [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3747.7599999999998s)]
*  going to be an amazing game. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3751.08s)]
*  It's a super dome. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3752.24s)]
*  This is just going to be magical. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3754.12s)]
*  And, uh, and everything was great except for the game, but New Orleans is the [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3755.8399999999997s)]
*  funny thing about New Orleans is it just never changes. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3759.3599999999997s)]
*  Like you go to, you go to, and I mean that in a good way, it just feels [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3763.24s)]
*  exactly like it did 23 years ago. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3766.8399999999997s)]
*  All the streets are the same. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3768.8799999999997s)]
*  All the lot of the hotels are the same. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3770.68s)]
*  They don't really, it's not one of those places where there's like 17. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3772.8799999999997s)]
*  Crazy new things that are up. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3776.4s)]
*  Um, they just really keep the soul of the place intact. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3778.12s)]
*  It's really a special place. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3781.04s)]
*  It's really fun to come visit. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3782.6s)]
*  It was especially like, I don't want to bum everyone out, but you know, there was [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3783.72s)]
*  a, you know, it was a national guard presence in the streets because of that [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3787.48s)]
*  asshole last month, um, you know, that, that attack. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3790.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3794.52s)]
*  Um, so that, like, that was a bummer, but the spirit of the city, I mean, it's one [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3794.9199999999996s)]
*  of, would you keep it if they said build three or four cities rotating, or do you [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3798.8399999999997s)]
*  just do New Orleans? [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3804.6s)]
*  Do you, do you, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3805.3999999999996s)]
*  said this for 20 years? [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3805.9199999999996s)]
*  No, to me it's Miami, New Orleans, Vegas. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3807.3199999999997s)]
*  That's it. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3813.36s)]
*  And I think you could make a case for LA because of, uh, cause of, but it's like, [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3813.76s)]
*  you know, it's a little spread out. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3818.0s)]
*  I think if you're just, I was watching the Rose bowl highlight. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3819.12s)]
*  I mean, that's my favorite game of all time anyway, 52 17 Cowboys over bills, [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3821.4s)]
*  but it just looked beautiful, right? [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3825.48s)]
*  With the sun setting and everything. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3827.12s)]
*  Like it's a nice to have an outdoor, uh, option too. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3828.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3831.6800000000003s)]
*  I think New Orleans, Miami and Vegas for the way the city kind of blends in with [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3831.88s)]
*  the game when it gets like they've, they love to have it in like Glendale, but [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3837.1600000000003s)]
*  Glendale people are staying in Phoenix. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3841.72s)]
*  They're staying in Scottsdale. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3843.3199999999997s)]
*  It's all over the map. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3844.6s)]
*  Um, it seems like they're getting out of the habit of putting it in cities just [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3846.08s)]
*  cause they built the stadium. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3849.24s)]
*  Like when they were doing that with Jackson, Atlanta, we don't need Atlanta. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3851.3599999999997s)]
*  We got no more. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3854.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3855.16s)]
*  I would go to New Orleans 10 times over Atlanta. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3855.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, the other thing with New Orleans is, um, it's really hard to get hotel [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3857.9199999999996s)]
*  rooms here, so the ticket demand, it's almost easier to get tickets than it is. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3861.24s)]
*  A hotel room anywhere near where the game is. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3867.7999999999997s)]
*  So a lot of tickets were down lower than face value, right? [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3869.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3873.32s)]
*  Tickets dropped. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3874.04s)]
*  Um, and you could get it on the market today for face value or lower, but we [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3875.44s)]
*  couldn't get was a hotel room because there was none and it's really hard to [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3880.2400000000002s)]
*  get in and out obviously, but, uh, it's really cool because if you get the, if [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3882.92s)]
*  you not going to get in a hotel, then the tickets drop it's a fascinating market. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3888.0800000000004s)]
*  Did we Superbowl in Dallas? [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3892.52s)]
*  Did we do that? [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3894.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, we did. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3895.2400000000002s)]
*  I went to that one. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3895.92s)]
*  That was kind of, I thought that was a pretty good one. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3897.6800000000003s)]
*  The weather was terrible, but it was, you know, that was okay. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3900.92s)]
*  But yeah, I would, wouldn't you say Vegas, New Orleans and Miami? [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3904.08s)]
*  Those are the four. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3907.1200000000003s)]
*  I would add LA back into it. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=3907.7200000000003s)]

*  Look at, I don't even know what the hell it was. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4212.68s)]
*  We were all staring at each other. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4214.8s)]
*  Like what the fuck, what is going on? [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4216.0s)]
*  He seemed to be in a dentist chair. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4218.04s)]
*  He was just saying gibberish and this is after an insane week on Twitter. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4220.08s)]
*  Um, yeah, I, you know, we don't have to get into it, but we live in a really [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4224.92s)]
*  messy, I mean, he went after everybody. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4228.68s)]
*  It's probably new after us. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4230.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4231.44s)]
*  I was like, and Fox let him kick him off. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4232.08s)]
*  Go down. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4233.64s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4235.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4235.84s)]
*  Kick him off the island too. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4236.08s)]
*  But that was the biggest shocker that and, uh, the chiefs lose my 35 points. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4237.36s)]
*  Whatever it was. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4241.76s)]
*  You know, it wasn't a great, wasn't a great year so far for the gambling. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4244.4400000000005s)]
*  Didn't do well on any of the chiefs beds. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4249.76s)]
*  The only dollar picks got killed in the playoffs. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4252.400000000001s)]
*  Just not, not great. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4254.320000000001s)]
*  But, um, my mom's text about what the hell is going on during the [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4255.6s)]
*  halftime show made up for 90% of it. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4259.88s)]
*  She didn't know what was happening. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4262.400000000001s)]
*  Is that it should almost be like its own social media channel of old people [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4264.2s)]
*  trying to understand the Superbowl halftime show act. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4268.16s)]
*  Which I think is part of the point of the halftime show act. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4271.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4273.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4274.04s)]
*  To just, to just make, make like at least one third of the country go [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4274.76s)]
*  like, what's going on? [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4278.28s)]
*  What's he saying? [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4279.96s)]
*  Um, yeah, that should be the ratings. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4281.52s)]
*  That should be like, Hey, how many mom texts were sent? [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4283.96s)]
*  Uh, what the hell is going on? [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4286.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4288.64s)]
*  This is terrible. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4288.84s)]
*  Nope. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4289.96s)]
*  I don't think anyone over 60 enjoyed it. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4290.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4292.44s)]
*  Um, I don't necessarily have a parent corner. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4292.88s)]
*  I have a wife corner and you kind of know this story, but I'm [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4297.44s)]
*  going to tell it again just for the pot. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4300.84s)]
*  So, uh, you guys are all here and house is here and house posts a picture [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4302.68s)]
*  of him and Paige Sparana on, on his Instagram. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4308.92s)]
*  It's him and van and Paige Sparana. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4313.0s)]
*  I took it. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4315.12s)]
*  Arms around them. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4315.8s)]
*  You took the picture. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4316.52s)]
*  So my wife that night is like, Hey, what's going on with house? [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4318.4800000000005s)]
*  And I'm like, what do you mean? [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4323.92s)]
*  And she's like, did you see his Instagram? [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4324.8s)]
*  I'm like, no, I didn't. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4326.52s)]
*  What happened? [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4327.4800000000005s)]
*  And, uh, she shows me and like, this is crazy. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4328.8s)]
*  Like his wife's like, what's his, his, his wife's going to like, like [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4331.0s)]
*  put all his stuff outside. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4335.599999999999s)]
*  Like, how do you do this? [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4336.84s)]
*  If you did this, I would fucking kill you. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4337.96s)]
*  Really? [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4339.72s)]
*  And I'm like, and I'm like, this that's Paige Sparana. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4340.24s)]
*  So now I have to walk her through the whole, this isn't just like, I took a [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4343.36s)]
*  picture with like an attractive blonde. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4348.16s)]
*  Like this is actually like somebody in the golf community. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4350.36s)]
*  She's got 4 million followers on Instagram. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4352.72s)]
*  You showing them the Instagram pictures? [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4355.08s)]
*  I w I brought her on Instagram. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4357.2s)]
*  I'm like, this is who it is. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4359.04s)]
*  It's a celebrity. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4360.08s)]
*  It's actually a very smart move by house for social media to take a picture with her. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4360.68s)]
*  Like this will probably be like the most looked at Instagram post. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4366.76s)]
*  Joe house, a man in his mid fifties is probably going to have this year. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4370.76s)]
*  So he has to do the post. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4374.12s)]
*  And so now I'm explaining to her this whole, you know, cottage industry of, of, uh, [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4375.400000000001s)]
*  of what, what Paige like leveraging social media. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4381.92s)]
*  Boy, I wouldn't think leading your wife to Paige's Instagram page would be the move, [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4385.719999999999s)]
*  but this work. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4391.0s)]
*  No, she, she was pro, she was like, oh, I get it now. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4392.0s)]
*  I get, I see it. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4395.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4396.2s)]
*  More power to her. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4396.639999999999s)]
*  She just didn't, she didn't understand why house was doing that. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4397.44s)]
*  She thought it was like some sort of like midlife crisis. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4399.879999999999s)]
*  My marriage is in the tank thing. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4404.36s)]
*  So I had to walk her through it and then also introduce her into the world of [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4405.839999999999s)]
*  social media and sports and how it takes some twists and turns. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4409.839999999999s)]
*  It was very exciting. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4414.04s)]
*  So when you, when you said later that your wife might not have been thrilled [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4415.5599999999995s)]
*  about the slim jam, like, you know what? [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4419.5199999999995s)]
*  We're all just trying to stay relevant here in the old sports media world. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4421.919999999999s)]
*  It's all about clicks. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4426.759999999999s)]
*  I could, I'm not going to end up probably with that woman. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4427.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4430.919999999999s)]
*  I don't think, you know, I'm not interested in her. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4431.24s)]
*  It's fine. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4433.28s)]
*  It's fine. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4433.959999999999s)]
*  But you know, Joe house, not a, not a polarizing guy. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4434.36s)]
*  I've never had a fight with them in 37 years. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4437.839999999999s)]
*  I'm one of the highest approval rating people of anybody who I'm friends with [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4441.28s)]
*  and beloved by my wife. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4445.639999999999s)]
*  And it was like the first time she's ever been mad at Joe house. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4447.28s)]
*  I didn't last, but it was like, for taking money out of an ATM and not gamble. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4450.4s)]
*  Like that to me is a worse offense than any of the page knocked him out of go to [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4455.36s)]
*  Island. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4459.84s)]
*  My wife today, um, the chiefs are down. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4460.48s)]
*  I don't even know what the hell score was. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4463.12s)]
*  And she comes up to me and I obviously have a lot of money on the chiefs. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4464.84s)]
*  And, um, and she's a, and she says, boy, chiefs are getting beat bad. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4467.5599999999995s)]
*  This is not what I expected. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4472.879999999999s)]
*  Is this what you expected? [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4474.5199999999995s)]
*  And I'm fucking hemorrhaging money at this point. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4475.879999999999s)]
*  And so I think I just, uh, I think I ran to the bathroom and cried. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4478.679999999999s)]
*  So you have no belt for your pants anymore. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4482.16s)]
*  You've lost everything. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4484.44s)]
*  It's still there. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4486.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4487.719999999999s)]
*  It's weird. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4487.919999999999s)]
*  Like dead wrong about the game. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4488.48s)]
*  Don't even feel that bad about it. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4491.32s)]
*  No, what are we going to do? [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4493.48s)]
*  Like the chiefs did this over and over again. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4494.44s)]
*  It was idiotic to go against them. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4496.04s)]
*  And I just didn't want to do it again after that Ravens game last year. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4498.4s)]
*  I just don't. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4501.6s)]
*  I didn't want it. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4502.24s)]
*  So now, now we can treat a football season normally. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4503.0s)]
*  Yep. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4506.96s)]
*  Now we can just bet against them. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4507.32s)]
*  Now we don't have to talk about this mystical thing that whatever, just have [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4508.72s)]
*  some opinions and now there's room on the Island. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4512.72s)]
*  Now the room, the Island is back. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4515.88s)]
*  The sweet, the penthouse suite has opened up on good Island. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4517.5199999999995s)]
*  Tom Brady's back. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4521.08s)]
*  Um, that's it. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4522.5199999999995s)]
*  All right, Sal. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4523.4s)]
*  So this is it for, uh, yet another football season for us. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4523.96s)]
*  This is season Oh seven to 16. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4527.72s)]
*  I think this is season 19 for us. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz16Ma-GBKY&t=4531.92s)]
