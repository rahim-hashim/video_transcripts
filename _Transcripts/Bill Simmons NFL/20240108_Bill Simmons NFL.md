# Predicting Bill Belichickâ€™s Next Team #shorts #billsimmons #billbelichick #patriots
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [January 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRnBb12x9ZQ)
*  Figured I was gonna have with Bill Belichick. So atlanta's gonna want them
*  They're gonna want them because Arthur blanks getting up in years
*  He lost to Belichick in the Super Bowl closest he's ever come to winning a title brings him in the architect of six Super Bowl
*  Champions will bring him in here. I have offensive weapons. Give him a QB
*  We'll go sign somebody or trade for somebody and he can rebuild the defense and we're gonna be competitive. I'm Arthur blank
*  Let's do this
*  The Patriots have been very careful about not firing Belichick kind of letting him say the first stuff
*  So he says that today says I'm still here. I'm under contract. Okay good to know this leads me to think the Falcons
*  Are gonna be granted permission to talk to Bill Belichick. Sure. We'll give you a permission. Go talk to them
*  They have the eighth pick in the draft
*  The Patriots second round pick is number 35
*  I think this leads to the Patriots release Belichick from his contract the Falcons give them the eighth pick the Patriots give them
*  Belichick and number 35 which would give the Patriots the third date picks in the draft
*  Everybody's happy. That's my prediction
