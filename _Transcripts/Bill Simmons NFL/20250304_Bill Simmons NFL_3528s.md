# Bleakest NFL Teams, QB Draft Drama, and Sunny Washington Times | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0)
*  Peter Schragger is here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=0.0s)]
*  Haven't talked to him in a while. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=0.84s)]
*  He was just at the combine. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1.8800000000000001s)]
*  Um, a lot of people are saying he was the one that broke up the Starbucks fight. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3.4s)]
*  I don't think he got a lot of credit for that. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=6.76s)]
*  You were like third man in just trying, trying to keep peace at an [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=8.08s)]
*  Indianapolis Starbucks combine crazy place. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=11.0s)]
*  You love it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  Is this like, is that your favorite week of the year? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=14.84s)]
*  It's the best. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  It's the best because you see something on TV and you're like, all right, it's a [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=18.16s)]
*  bunch of people in their underwear working out and like, it's not even 1% of [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=21.44s)]
*  what combine week is. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=25.52s)]
*  And I would advise any young aspiring NFL journalist, any NFL fan to like, go, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=26.96s)]
*  go for a couple of days because as much as it's about the on-field drills, like [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  you will bump into Mike Tomlin at a restaurant. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=37.28s)]
*  You will see, you know, Sean Payton, just, you know, having a private meeting with [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=40.08s)]
*  an agent out in the open, um, in front of that JW, uh, Marriott Starbucks, which [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=44.2s)]
*  by the way is it's like literally going to like Times Square and starting a fight [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=49.08s)]
*  when it's at combine. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  That's like the hub of everything. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=55.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=57.36s)]
*  J W. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=57.68s)]
*  So like 10 teams are at the JW, every media members at the JW. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=58.72s)]
*  And for that interaction or that altercation or whatever it means to happen [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=63.6s)]
*  at that Starbucks, you know, obviously the irony of Jordan Schultz, his father [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=67.56s)]
*  being the longtime CEO of Starbucks is one thing, but to do it there in that [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=71.56s)]
*  public of a forum, like I got texts from, you know, NFL coach, NFL GM, three agents, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=75.48s)]
*  four different media members that like, Oh, there was just something. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=81.88s)]
*  So, uh, that is the crossroads of all things. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=84.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=87.56s)]
*  So it was Jordan Schultz and Ian Rapoport to, uh, to NFL insiders for lack of a [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=87.8s)]
*  better word, and it would have been funnier if it was cause Rapoport made some sort [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=92.64s)]
*  of crack about your dad cost Seattle the Sonics. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=97.24s)]
*  And that was like, it was like way more deep seated, but it just seemed [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=100.72s)]
*  like some insider kerfuffle. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=103.6s)]
*  Um, the big thing I'm looking at, and there's already been some buzz about [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  the giants trading up. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=109.47999999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=111.16s)]
*  Do you feel like it was true that the giants could have had Stafford and they [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  had the draft pick compensation? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  Rich Eisen reported that yesterday. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=116.72s)]
*  Do we feel like that is a hundred percent accurate that the Rams were just ready [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=118.16s)]
*  to trade Stafford to the giants or no? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=122.28s)]
*  No, I think that the giants had the parameters in place and were willing to [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=124.56s)]
*  engage, but the Rams never went down that road in such a formal fashion. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=128.35999999999999s)]
*  So they had conversations essentially. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=131.6s)]
*  Stafford couldn't shop himself to any of these teams, not a free agent. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=134.2s)]
*  So what the Rams did was they gave Jimmy Sexton, his agent, who's, you know, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=137.23999999999998s)]
*  big power, Nick Saban's agent, he's Parcells' agent, like a big agent, the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=141.39999999999998s)]
*  ability to go look at what the market would be and the giants were obviously [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=145.44s)]
*  interested and the trade. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=150.6s)]
*  Not for the first round pick though. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=152.92s)]
*  No, no, it was likely. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  And I know it from all angles because of my relationship with McVeigh, but [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=157.0s)]
*  also my relationship with Stafford. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=159.92s)]
*  So it was, you know, go see what's out there and what destinations could be [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=161.48s)]
*  possible. And it came down to basically the Raiders being very interested in [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=166.12s)]
*  the giants. And what I think the trade compensation would have been would have [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=169.84s)]
*  been giants give up their second round pick, which is the 34th pick. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  And then the Rams give back a third round and Stafford, but then Stafford [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=177.0s)]
*  would need to tear up the contract and have a massive contract, which would [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=181.0s)]
*  have been paying him close to $15 million more per year than what he's [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=183.88s)]
*  essentially going to play for with the Rams. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=187.52s)]
*  And at the end of the day, like they went down this road and as it dragged on [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=189.68s)]
*  day by day by day, I think at one point, like on Wednesday, I was like, wow, it [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=193.48s)]
*  might actually happen. And it might actually be the Raiders or the giants. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  But then by Thursday, when I got word that like Stafford and McVeigh were having [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=199.92s)]
*  breakfast at six 30 in the morning in L.A., I'm like, it's done. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=203.6s)]
*  Like, and this conversation started back at Super Bowl, whether that was like [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=206.72s)]
*  some of the rumors. And I got caught in a little bit of shit because I was [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=211.39999999999998s)]
*  interviewed and caught off guard. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=214.12s)]
*  And it was like, what do you think about Stafford and the Rams? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=215.28s)]
*  And I'm like, I just know this, that they're going to have to have [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=218.44s)]
*  conversations and figure out a new contract. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=220.6s)]
*  But also, I know that McVeigh loves Jimmy G and that set off like an entire [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=222.4s)]
*  like, like, you got aggregated, got aggregated. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  But if they were to move on from Stafford, which cooler heads prevailed, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=230.12s)]
*  like they had backup plans, they had Jimmy G. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=234.76s)]
*  And then all the reports are accurate that Rogers could have very well been the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=237.16s)]
*  next quarterback of Los Angeles Rams. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=241.12s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, the Giants are so stupid. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=243.07999999999998s)]
*  What's the point in trading for Stafford? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=245.76s)]
*  We're going to win the Super Bowl in the next three years. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=247.4s)]
*  Like that's there's nothing. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  You're going to give up a possible starter slash all pro in the second round [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=250.36s)]
*  because you want to go seven and ten. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  What was the alternative? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=256.72s)]
*  They think they're a quarterback away from being relevant. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=258.12s)]
*  And I don't think it's that far off. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=261.0s)]
*  I look at their team. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=262.2s)]
*  I mean, they get Andrew Thomas back at offensive tackle. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  And then last year, neighbors. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=266.68s)]
*  I didn't realize bumping them up to 11 wins. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=267.88s)]
*  Are they in the same division with Washington and Philly? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=271.12s)]
*  They're confident that this team is not that far off and that the quarterback [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=273.52000000000004s)]
*  play was abysmal last year. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=276.8s)]
*  Come on. You can't believe that. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=277.92s)]
*  Why not? You've got a first round picks all over the offensive line. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=280.44s)]
*  They've got Malik neighbors and they've got this. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=283.76s)]
*  One of those first round picks is Evan Neal, isn't it? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=285.56s)]
*  Sure. So that's a wash, right? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=287.8s)]
*  So like Neal's not the guy. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=289.16s)]
*  Come on. They have no chance. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=290.92s)]
*  I would be going the other way and trying to trade guys to get more picks [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=292.48s)]
*  and try to look at their front four. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=295.72s)]
*  You've got Dexter Lawrence, Tibbado and you got Brian Burns. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=297.2s)]
*  Like they're not. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=299.92s)]
*  This is this is a team that everyone's like, oh, I can't believe they got rid of Saquon. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=301.0s)]
*  I can't believe Saquon wasn't going to do anything with the Giants last year. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=304.68s)]
*  Close to what he did with the Eagles. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=307.72s)]
*  So what they do instead, they invested in their offensive line and they have. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=309.4s)]
*  And they got a high pick. But this is the point. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=312.64s)]
*  Then then talk yourself into Cam Ward if you think he can be a top three pick. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=315.2s)]
*  I mean, so that this is why I brought up Stafford, because the stuff [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=319.32s)]
*  has started today about they're going to leapfrog to one. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=322.67999999999995s)]
*  They're going to take them one. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=325.15999999999997s)]
*  It just feels like Cam Ward's going first in this draft. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=326.23999999999995s)]
*  He very well. I very well. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=328.84s)]
*  It doesn't mean he's the best player. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=330.79999999999995s)]
*  It doesn't mean it makes sense. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=332.64s)]
*  But there's three teams right now [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=334.52s)]
*  who just have no idea who their quarterback is going to be. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=337.12s)]
*  The Raiders have the best chance to probably [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=339.0s)]
*  stumble into one because they have all the cap space. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=341.6s)]
*  The Giants, I don't know how they get one [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=344.48s)]
*  that actually make my case that I just laid out. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=347.56s)]
*  How are you going to make the playoffs? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=350.48s)]
*  Like, you're better off betting on a guy who maybe can become the guy. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=351.8s)]
*  Here. Here's the case for bringing in a Rogers at 41. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=356.88s)]
*  For the Giants? Yes, here's the case. Hear me out. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=361.64s)]
*  Motivated, cheap compared to what. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=365.68s)]
*  Motivated. Yes. Embarrassed. Embarrassed. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=368.79999999999995s)]
*  That the Jets said we're good without you. Motivated. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=371.15999999999997s)]
*  Cheap comparable to a Stafford or to one of these, you know, bigger. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=375.35999999999996s)]
*  Definitely be cheap. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=380.12s)]
*  And then and you've got Brian Dable, who has had his name [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  from being coach of the year to now being the clown of New York [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=385.96s)]
*  and being considered a joke like two guys that know football inside and out. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=388.59999999999997s)]
*  And let's let's say screw it and let's get over the giant [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=393.15999999999997s)]
*  chip of our shoulder and see now look. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=395.52s)]
*  Well, that was the case. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=397.71999999999997s)]
*  They love to get to one. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=399.76s)]
*  Sure, they would love to get one. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=401.44s)]
*  But here's the deal. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=402.68s)]
*  Rogers, as much as you don't like them, as much as Kimmel doesn't like them, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=404.0s)]
*  as much as Cousins, Sal doesn't like them. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=408.08s)]
*  Players like them. His teammates like the Jets. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=410.15999999999997s)]
*  Fans didn't like him. Can we throw them in? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=412.35999999999996s)]
*  Throw in how he looked last year. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=414.35999999999996s)]
*  We had no legs and didn't want to get hit and was terrible. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=415.88s)]
*  I think he had 28 touchdowns, 11 interceptions. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=418.35999999999996s)]
*  I'm pushing the boulder up the hill here. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=420.96s)]
*  I'm trying. But I would say this. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=423.08s)]
*  The alternatives of a we could roll out Rogers and still get a young quarterback. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=425.52000000000004s)]
*  And you have Rogers as your quarterback for this year [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=430.6s)]
*  and you're not throwing someone to the wolves and saying, hey, go out there [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=433.56s)]
*  and play for your first season right out of the gates. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=437.44s)]
*  That's the argument to make. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=440.04s)]
*  I would also add that, you know, the Titans have the first pick in the draft. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=442.28000000000003s)]
*  Will Levis will not be there starting quarterback week one. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=446.56s)]
*  I know that's not that necessarily out there. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=448.92s)]
*  I don't see it. A good run. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=451.20000000000005s)]
*  I don't think the Browns are going to start the Sean Watson because he can't physically. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=453.04s)]
*  But I don't think the Sean Watson is going to have any snaps, if any, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=456.32s)]
*  again, as a Cleveland Brown in his NFL career. I'll say that. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=458.56s)]
*  So that's a second team. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=461.56s)]
*  Then you got the Giants. Then you got the Jets. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=463.0s)]
*  Then you got the Raiders. So this whole. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=465.4s)]
*  So you have four teams in the top seven, basically, that desperately need a quarterback. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=467.28s)]
*  Yes. So Kim Ward has to go first. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=471.36s)]
*  And it's not even going to matter whether he should be the first pick. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=474.04s)]
*  And usually, what is it? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=477.04s)]
*  It's 50-50 with a quarterback that high. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=478.56s)]
*  Those are the guys from the last 25 years. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=480.72s)]
*  It might even be like 35-65 for him to be good. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=482.36s)]
*  Totally. But you still got to do it. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=485.8s)]
*  And look, if you're the Titans and you can, you know, maybe trade back and still get [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=487.40000000000003s)]
*  Abdul Carter and Travis Hunter at three or at five or at two. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=492.44s)]
*  That's fine. But you still don't have a quarterback. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=497.6s)]
*  So so to me, the Titans and I've done a lot of work and talk to everybody this week, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=499.72s)]
*  like everyone assumes they're going to go Carter one or Hunter one. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=504.44s)]
*  And they're or they're going to let someone trade up. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=509.16s)]
*  No, like I wouldn't I wouldn't dismiss Kim Ward at one. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=511.6s)]
*  Get us the quarterback and then we can figure it out and get a bridge quarterback if we need. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=515.2s)]
*  And by bridge quarterback, I'm not talking Sam Darnold. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=520.0s)]
*  I'm talking like a Jared Stidham or a Taylor Heinecky or like one of those guys. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=522.76s)]
*  Because last year talking to now, but those are the guys that start off like a Jacobi [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=526.5600000000001s)]
*  Berset last year or a Marcus Mariota in the room. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=530.6800000000001s)]
*  I know. But this is the Raiders last year. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=534.5600000000001s)]
*  Right. Well, Minshew will be a stopgap. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=536.8000000000001s)]
*  And then you get him ward. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=539.24s)]
*  Yeah, you're good. And you've got your guy. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=541.52s)]
*  So I talked to Cliff and Adam Peters a bunch. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=543.28s)]
*  And it's like the underrated guy in this whole process for Jaden Daniels was having Mariota [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=546.84s)]
*  there because he had a veteran to learn from who had like that's almost as key as drafting. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=551.88s)]
*  The right quarterback is getting the right room. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=556.32s)]
*  And last year, Caleb had Tyson Bajan and a couple of undrafted guys and in like a bunch of [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=558.08s)]
*  like second, third options as quarterback. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=564.76s)]
*  Drake may had Berset, which I think was a bonus, considering you don't have a coaching [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=567.4s)]
*  staff, but at least he had Jacobi Berset. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=571.3199999999999s)]
*  And look at what Drake May's got this year. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=573.52s)]
*  You now add in Josh McDaniels, you add in Todd Downing. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=575.76s)]
*  You suddenly have like a real staff around him and guys that have been there and done [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=580.04s)]
*  that. And of course, Vrabel is a is an upgrade I had coach as well. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=583.8s)]
*  Is there I was texting with Todd McShea about this this morning. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=588.4399999999999s)]
*  Isn't is it a likely scenario that quarterbacks go one to even if it makes no sense [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=591.4399999999999s)]
*  whatsoever? Because nobody's been able to explain to me why the Browns wouldn't take [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=596.72s)]
*  a quarterback. When the Sean Watson isn't playing again, they're absolutely screwed [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=600.4s)]
*  with the cap. There is no possible way they can acquire anybody. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=605.96s)]
*  And this is their one chance to actually add somebody. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=609.44s)]
*  So I don't what was the I mean, there's been the Sanders stuff and the stories about the [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=612.9200000000001s)]
*  stories and the narratives behind the narratives. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=617.9200000000001s)]
*  We've gone in nine different directions. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=620.48s)]
*  And anonymous QB coaches. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=622.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's going to get worse and worse. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=625.0s)]
*  And it's also he's got a famous father who might decide I want to nudge him toward a [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=626.88s)]
*  certain team and is going to know some tricks. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=632.36s)]
*  Some other families don't. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=634.04s)]
*  Which if by the way, I think that should happen more often. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=635.52s)]
*  I think that should happen with Cooper Flagg and the NBA. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=638.52s)]
*  Like you have the leverage. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=641.0s)]
*  Like we always talk about player empowerment with the NBA and pick a winner. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=642.8000000000001s)]
*  Like it's never with the rookie. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=647.04s)]
*  We saw it with Eli Manning when you want to go to San Diego. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=648.88s)]
*  Ended up with the Giants. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=651.5600000000001s)]
*  Like I'm always amazed that doesn't happen more often. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=652.52s)]
*  But if Deion is like, I want Sanders on Vegas. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=654.52s)]
*  That's just how this is going to play out. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=658.68s)]
*  It would be pretty hard for the rest of the league to stop that. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=660.92s)]
*  Anyway, I feel like there's a one, two scenario with the QBs, right? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=663.0799999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=665.96s)]
*  And Cleveland very interested in quarterbacks. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=667.04s)]
*  And you look at the free agent crop right now. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=670.3199999999999s)]
*  I don't have a team for Sam Darnold that's given him 40 million dollars. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=673.48s)]
*  I think Sam Darnold, who had arguably the best 17 weeks of his life, had maybe the [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=677.64s)]
*  most disastrous and financially prohibitive eight days any quarterbacks ever had in NFL history. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=684.3199999999999s)]
*  Oh, shit, you're right. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=692.16s)]
*  It wasn't even two weeks. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=692.92s)]
*  It was eight days. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=693.92s)]
*  Eight days. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=694.8s)]
*  It was that Sunday night. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=695.4s)]
*  It's like a Hawaii trip. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=696.68s)]
*  It really is. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=698.0s)]
*  It's like White Lotus. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=698.48s)]
*  It was like... [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=699.12s)]
*  He had White Lotus season four. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=701.3199999999999s)]
*  I've lost $80 billion. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=703.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=704.6s)]
*  He was like Isaac's... [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=705.1600000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=707.4000000000001s)]
*  Saxon, what a name. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=709.2s)]
*  So you've got the Sunday night against the Lions, then you have an even worse disastrous [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=710.96s)]
*  performance against the Rams eight days later in Arizona. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=715.76s)]
*  And it went from being potentially lying around the block of teams to like this week at the [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=718.4000000000001s)]
*  combine, not a lot of Darnold love. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=723.1600000000001s)]
*  So can't go back to the Jets. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=726.0400000000001s)]
*  It doesn't sound like the Giants. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=727.88s)]
*  I don't think the Raiders are doing flips over Sam Darnold. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=729.8000000000001s)]
*  The Steelers seem to be pretty happy and going for Justin Fields is what the latest I've [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=732.28s)]
*  heard. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=736.16s)]
*  So now the teams are rather limited. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=736.88s)]
*  Are the Browns going to break the bank after already paying Dishonel and now pay for Sam [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=738.48s)]
*  Darnold? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=742.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=743.2s)]
*  So Darnold's number one on that list. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=743.6800000000001s)]
*  And then it's like very quickly gets to Kurt Cousins and Russell Wilson. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=746.2s)]
*  And I said Jared Stidham. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=750.16s)]
*  Like those are the names. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=752.44s)]
*  And it's not exactly previous years where there's this long list of, well, Baker Mayfield [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=753.96s)]
*  might be a possibility. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=760.16s)]
*  Or we could do like you might be looking at for the Browns like, all right, it's Daniel [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=761.36s)]
*  Jones, Carson Wentz. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=765.04s)]
*  Are we draft someone at two? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=766.16s)]
*  And then you're at that point, you're like, that's chilling. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=768.08s)]
*  Let's draft someone at two. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=770.5600000000001s)]
*  Which is why the Giants would have to leapfrog the Browns at two to get Ken Ward, which [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=772.8000000000001s)]
*  is why I think Ken Ward is going to be the first pick. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=777.6s)]
*  And I'm with you. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=779.84s)]
*  And I also think Giants beat the Colts in a non insignificant week 16 game and Lake [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=780.72s)]
*  neighbors had about 200 yards and it cost the Giants the top two picks. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=786.84s)]
*  And now we're talking about the drew lock game. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=790.0s)]
*  That's what it's called now. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=792.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=793.24s)]
*  We had the Pats had the Joe Milton game and there was the, but drew lock was [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=793.6s)]
*  incredible in that game. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=797.08s)]
*  Cause I bet on the Colts drew lock was lights out. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=798.08s)]
*  I mean, you can make a case like, yo, look at that drew lock tape. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=801.96s)]
*  Maybe we, maybe we have the solution in house. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=804.84s)]
*  Maybe he's a free agent himself. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=807.36s)]
*  So, uh, it's, it's, I think it's a very good possibility that despite the fact that [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=809.08s)]
*  this draft class at quarterback is nowhere near last year's. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=815.24s)]
*  Like those one, two, three picks last year, it, those guys, those guys have been [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=819.64s)]
*  talking about for 12 months and it was no brainer. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=824.3199999999999s)]
*  They're going one, two, three. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=827.3199999999999s)]
*  And it was like, if you can get in the top three, you're getting a franchise [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=828.4399999999999s)]
*  quarterback now, Bo Nicks was not viewed this way. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=830.6s)]
*  Michael Pennings wasn't seen as a top. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=834.04s)]
*  And McCarthy was like this wild card, which still is a wild card this year. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=836.48s)]
*  Cam Ward's got huge upside, but despite the great years he's had at Washington [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=841.4s)]
*  state and Miami, he's not viewed in that same category as those top three guys. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=846.88s)]
*  And then it's a giant drop off from what I gather. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=850.4399999999999s)]
*  And then just viewed as prospects, not necessarily how they turn out. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=853.28s)]
*  Shador Jackson, dart, and then a bunch of unknowns. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=856.72s)]
*  So you have Shador like next to Jackson dart potentially. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=860.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=863.88s)]
*  I've got, I think, I think Shador is viewed closer to Jackson dart than [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=864.04s)]
*  Shador is viewed. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=867.28s)]
*  Wow. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=868.04s)]
*  So he could be a drop ship on the shoulder guy. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=869.4s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=871.96s)]
*  And you're talking about leverage that Deonna, I don't, I don't know if they [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=873.08s)]
*  have leverage, unless they've gotten agreement from a team that's like, Hey, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=875.96s)]
*  no matter what we're taking them, don't worry. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=878.6s)]
*  You guys can like, he, I don't, can I zag? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=880.48s)]
*  I'm going to zag. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=883.64s)]
*  Son of a famous person. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=886.5600000000001s)]
*  Tough. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=889.36s)]
*  Seems like he's smart. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=890.96s)]
*  It seems like the thing that people are worried about with him is the [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=891.96s)]
*  athleticism more than anything, but he's got the toughness and the competitiveness [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=894.5600000000001s)]
*  that they like. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=898.6s)]
*  And I do feel like as we get closer to the team, start talking themselves [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=899.24s)]
*  into the pluses. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=902.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=904.36s)]
*  Cause the minuses aren't like, this guy's kind of a wuss. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=904.68s)]
*  This guy's not a leader of men. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=908.16s)]
*  You know, they're more like, don't read any of that shit. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=910.16s)]
*  He's not a diva. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=913.2399999999999s)]
*  This guy chose to go to Jackson state. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=913.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=916.1199999999999s)]
*  Also, I tweeted this yesterday and I'm sure it was the tweet that that [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=917.16s)]
*  signed off a million. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=921.8399999999999s)]
*  No, no one cared. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=923.0s)]
*  I tweeted this yesterday that the one thing a GM told me, don't sleep on [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=924.0s)]
*  Shador with this is he is tough as shit. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=928.0799999999999s)]
*  Got the shit kicked out of him the last few years and got up every single time. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=931.9599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=936.68s)]
*  And they love that. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=937.4s)]
*  That is tough. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=938.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=940.36s)]
*  You don't love the fact that he's been beaten around a bunch, but you do love [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=940.56s)]
*  the fact that he didn't cry about it. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=943.8399999999999s)]
*  Didn't whine about it. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=945.88s)]
*  Got up. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=946.68s)]
*  He was against an inferior off. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=947.12s)]
*  He was behind an inferior offensive line on a team that was really just like [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=948.24s)]
*  slapped together in the last couple of years and they put together some wins [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=952.7199999999999s)]
*  early, but this was not the same level of talent that necessarily a Jackson [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=955.52s)]
*  dart had at old miss or a Queenie worse had at Texas. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=960.6s)]
*  This was the Shador and his point at the combine and it rubbed people wrong. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=963.4s)]
*  The way he was had some bravado at it is that he changes places when he gets there. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=967.28s)]
*  So Jackson state obviously went from this HBCU that had no resources to [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=971.88s)]
*  suddenly being a national name. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=976.36s)]
*  And then he goes to Colorado and we had one week where big noon kickoff from [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=977.44s)]
*  Fox and game day were there a week to vying for real estate in Boulder. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=981.64s)]
*  It happens. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=986.0s)]
*  And the Dion thing is real, but there's also a lot of positives to that in that [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=987.16s)]
*  he's the son of one of the greatest football players ever, and he's seen how [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=991.7199999999999s)]
*  to handle yourself as a pro and he's seen how the business works and should [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=994.92s)]
*  door has never wavered in that he is a leader and those guys do do respect him. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=998.04s)]
*  There's the other piece of that. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1002.04s)]
*  When you think about quarterback prospects, cause there's two versions of it. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1003.56s)]
*  Right? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1006.4799999999999s)]
*  There's a quarterback who had the weight of the college on their shoulders. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1006.7199999999999s)]
*  And then there's the guy who was on an awesome team where the program was kind [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1010.92s)]
*  of the star and they were the quarterback of it. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1014.28s)]
*  And some of the guys that have succeeded, especially recently, you know, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1016.56s)]
*  Drake may just, he stayed in North Carolina. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1020.7199999999999s)]
*  He was the whole program. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1023.56s)]
*  He took all the leadership responsibilities and it was even though the record kind [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1024.96s)]
*  of came and went, but he was whatever. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1028.6s)]
*  Bo Nix was in the spotlight in real ways in different colleges. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1031.0s)]
*  And then Jayden Daniels, same thing. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1035.36s)]
*  And then he has that LSU year where I just wonder sometimes, is it better to. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1036.8799999999999s)]
*  In college, you're really the guy, at least for a year. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1042.56s)]
*  Does that prep you in a certain way to, whereas you look at like a [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1047.12s)]
*  Trubisky, like I would study if I was a team, have somebody study, like. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1051.32s)]
*  Like the ones that didn't work and like, what are the common denominators? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1059.76s)]
*  And one of them is like, not enough starts. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1062.84s)]
*  Like that was a Trey Lance thing too. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1064.6s)]
*  Um, how big was the spotlight? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1066.6399999999999s)]
*  How much pressure were they under on this limited level? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1068.72s)]
*  And how did that go to the, how is that going to transfer Sanders had like [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1071.28s)]
*  a giant spotlight on him for three years there, which I think is a positive. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1074.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1079.56s)]
*  I mean, the Colorado years, but also in Jackson state, they've really put a [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1079.92s)]
*  lot of resources into marketing that thing. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1083.2s)]
*  And like the fact he decided to go there and they brought Hunter there. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1084.96s)]
*  That was a major story for a lot of reasons. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1087.76s)]
*  They were in the limelight. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1089.68s)]
*  It was those two in Dion. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1090.56s)]
*  It was a real thing. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1091.84s)]
*  And Troy Aikman would show up at games and they had like, it became a thing. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1092.96s)]
*  Um, I think last year might've changed the narrative a little bit. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1097.44s)]
*  Bo Nix played 61 games in college. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1100.6000000000001s)]
*  He was older than every other prospect in that draft. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1103.24s)]
*  He shows up and he was immediately dismissed by a lot of teams because [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1106.8400000000001s)]
*  well, we've seen Bo Nix, like there's no upside. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1110.3600000000001s)]
*  Like, and Sean Payton, who, you know, I'm going to always talk about. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1112.56s)]
*  If I get an opportunity, it was like, I like the fact he's played 61 games [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1116.28s)]
*  and did it in the sec and then played at the senior bowl and then was in, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1120.3600000000001s)]
*  you know, major college games. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1124.44s)]
*  Like I liked that fact. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1126.0s)]
*  So this year you've got this guy, Tyler Shuck, who's not being discussed at all. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1126.72s)]
*  Watch. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1131.04s)]
*  He will re rising off draft boards. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1131.8s)]
*  He was at a Louisville, but was at Texas tech before that. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1133.88s)]
*  And somewhere else before that he's played a ton of college football is 25 years old. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1136.64s)]
*  And in the past, it'd be like, we don't want that Shuck stock is rising because [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1140.72s)]
*  of all the experience he's had. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1145.0s)]
*  Brock Purdy, same thing. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1147.64s)]
*  He played all those years at Iowa state. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1149.16s)]
*  Like we liked that because, you know, cam ward, we know he went from [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1150.96s)]
*  Washington state to Miami. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1155.2s)]
*  He started out incarnate word. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1156.68s)]
*  That was his first school zero, zero offers anywhere. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1158.72s)]
*  But he changed that program, went to Washington state and on a bad Washington [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1162.16s)]
*  state team competed with all of the pack 12 heavies and did well. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1166.0s)]
*  And then goes over to Miami and breaks every school record and ends up with the [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1169.56s)]
*  most touchdowns ever thrown in college football. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1174.56s)]
*  And it's like, that's, that's a, that's a, that's a resume. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1176.44s)]
*  That is a, that is life lessons. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1180.28s)]
*  That is, that is, that is adversity. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1181.8s)]
*  That is different offenses. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1183.8s)]
*  It's going into a new situation, having to meet a bunch of people. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1185.3600000000001s)]
*  And I'm going to be the alpha. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1188.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1189.8400000000001s)]
*  Um, I know we're a little bit all over the place, but like, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1190.1200000000001s)]
*  can we go back to the experience self for a second? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1193.28s)]
*  Cause yeah, I think this is actually the case for Darnold who I think is [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1195.24s)]
*  now an underrated asset. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1199.24s)]
*  He had watched 27 games at USC, right. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1200.56s)]
*  Where he started. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1204.44s)]
*  Yep. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1205.52s)]
*  And then if you go in as a pro, he started 73 games over the last eight years. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1205.92s)]
*  He's at a hundred career starts now and look great until those last two weeks. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1211.8s)]
*  Is that a Minnesota offensive line issue? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1218.8799999999999s)]
*  Was it a scheming issue? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1222.04s)]
*  Was it just that he played two great teams? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1223.16s)]
*  Like I feel as if we get closer to free agency, there's going to be teams. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1225.16s)]
*  Tilting it going glass half full because if you can get him for less than the [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1229.44s)]
*  Baker, let's say you can get him for 15 to 20, let's say you can get him to 15 [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1234.08s)]
*  to 20. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1238.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1238.92s)]
*  The question is, is someone doing that? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1239.4s)]
*  Like 30 to 40. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1241.76s)]
*  But you're telling me the Raiders wouldn't want to spend 20 million a year on Sam [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1243.24s)]
*  Darnold if they couldn't get the thing. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1246.2800000000002s)]
*  That would be Brady just being like, this guy doesn't have it. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1247.8000000000002s)]
*  I'm out. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1249.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1250.6000000000001s)]
*  That's what that would be. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1250.88s)]
*  I would, if that's his number and the Raiders aren't in that's Brady saying, I [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1251.48s)]
*  don't give my vote of approval on this. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1255.0400000000002s)]
*  Look, I, my, now that we're two months removed and I, I think this might've been [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1257.2s)]
*  the case and I'm gonna make an excuse for them. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1261.52s)]
*  I think that Sunday night game with so much buildup and so much on the line for [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1263.3600000000001s)]
*  the Vikings and the Lions killed both those teams that they, right. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1267.84s)]
*  They, it was like a regular season Superbowl. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1271.8799999999999s)]
*  It was a Superbowl. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1274.56s)]
*  They destroyed each other. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1275.36s)]
*  They got, they were all, they knew what was at stake. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1276.6799999999998s)]
*  You had a home field during the playoffs. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1278.9199999999998s)]
*  The number one seed was in the balance as well. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1281.6799999999998s)]
*  And like, it was the most significant football game in the regular season. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1283.6799999999998s)]
*  This league has ever seen for both teams and they both just destroyed each other [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1287.04s)]
*  and put everything into it that they were both completely flat. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1291.56s)]
*  The next time we saw them and the Lions, of course, they lose on the [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1294.56s)]
*  Saturday that follows, but then the Vikings lost the Monday that proceeded that. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1297.6s)]
*  So Darnold those eight days and everyone I speak to who's negative on Darnold is [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1301.76s)]
*  like, well, that's, that's what you hoped you never saw again that he erased it. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1306.56s)]
*  But like there it was. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1310.16s)]
*  That was the 35 and 12. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1311.28s)]
*  I mean, if it's Aaron Rogers versus Darnold, come on. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1312.56s)]
*  Kyle's going to turn the Tik TOK camera on because I have a very [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1315.6s)]
*  important Tom Brady point. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1318.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1319.52s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1319.76s)]
*  Tom Brady. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1320.96s)]
*  I love Tom Brady brought me six Superbowls. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1321.4s)]
*  One of my favorite athletes of all time. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1323.44s)]
*  This is a dangerous thing where you have him running a football team, thinking [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1326.2s)]
*  he knows what's best with quarterback because he was a great quarterback, because [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1331.72s)]
*  all of the evidence with the great players we've ever had named the sport. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1335.8s)]
*  Mostly they're not good at this. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1341.4s)]
*  They see that they think they're saying things that other people don't see. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1343.4s)]
*  And it's not actually rational. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1346.72s)]
*  Like Magic Johnson, Lonzo ball got hurt, obviously, but Magic Johnson took [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1348.0s)]
*  Lonzo ball over Jason Tatum. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1352.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1355.3600000000001s)]
*  You have, uh, like Wayne Gretzky ran a hockey team. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1356.2s)]
*  How did that go? [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1360.2s)]
*  Um, I'm trying to think, uh, who was, I don't have much on the coyotes. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1361.64s)]
*  Were they no good? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1364.68s)]
*  Was Shane Doe not good enough? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1365.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1366.5600000000002s)]
*  But Michael Jordan ran the Charlotte Hornet slash Bobcats for the big Sean [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1367.8400000000001s)]
*  May guy couldn't have been worse. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1374.1200000000001s)]
*  Like steered them toward Kwame Brown. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1375.76s)]
*  The wizard steered them toward Kwame Brown over Palgasol and those guys. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1378.52s)]
*  Cause he liked what he saw from Kwame Brown to workout. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1382.6s)]
*  Like, I don't know if I trust the greatest players ever on stuff like this. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1385.32s)]
*  That's an interesting take. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1389.12s)]
*  Are there, is there the argument against that? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1390.04s)]
*  Cause you don't want to argue with that. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1392.1999999999998s)]
*  Jerry West is the greatest evaluator the NBA has ever seen. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1393.76s)]
*  Jerry West. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1396.0s)]
*  So there's, so Jerry West is a positive. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1396.4399999999998s)]
*  There's some that wouldn't, I'm just saying it's not a slam dunk, but I [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1398.6s)]
*  think part of the problem is if you and I are in that room with Tom Brady and [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1401.1599999999999s)]
*  we're like, yo man, we think Darnold like look at these first 17 and Brady's like, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1405.48s)]
*  I'm out. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1410.28s)]
*  I watched that game. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1410.9599999999998s)]
*  He doesn't have it. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1411.96s)]
*  I'm out. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1412.72s)]
*  Why are we going to argue with Tom Brady? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1413.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1414.88s)]
*  So it's just you now you be, now it's like this one voice that just sees [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1415.1200000000001s)]
*  what he wants to see. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1418.8s)]
*  Fascinated by the Raiders set up and John Spytech is the new GM. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1420.16s)]
*  He was in Tampa for years and before that Denver and is really a good [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1424.28s)]
*  evaluator and I interviewed him at the combine on camera for NFL network. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1429.3600000000001s)]
*  And I said, all right, you got a lot of voices now because it's not just Brady. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1433.8s)]
*  Pete Carroll is going to have opinions. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1437.2s)]
*  Chip Kelly is the offensive coordinator. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1439.0s)]
*  And then you've got all these different voices that are now new ownership group. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1441.76s)]
*  You've got the Melman people. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1445.52s)]
*  It's like, okay, now we've got all this and whoever this quarterback is going to [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1447.32s)]
*  be is going to be their first big like unveiling of like, here's, here's our [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1451.8s)]
*  group decision. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1455.28s)]
*  That's a lot of pressure on that quarterback. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1456.6s)]
*  I don't think they're just going to go with a Minshew O'Connell thing. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1459.36s)]
*  I think they're going to try to find somebody. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1462.72s)]
*  Could there be some new owner syndrome with this? [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1464.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1467.36s)]
*  Where they're like, yeah, we make a splash. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1467.8799999999999s)]
*  Got to get somebody really good. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1471.12s)]
*  Got to get Chip Kelly's offense. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1472.72s)]
*  Got to find the right person. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1475.32s)]
*  Nice mobile. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1476.6399999999999s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1478.1599999999999s)]
*  And I would go through Brady's relationships with some of these guys. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1478.84s)]
*  What's his relationship with Rogers? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1481.32s)]
*  They've known each other 20 years. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1482.9199999999998s)]
*  They've been competitive. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1484.24s)]
*  What's his relationship with Russell? [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1484.96s)]
*  I can't believe they've played in a Superbowl together. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1486.04s)]
*  Is Russell Wilson going to be the quarterback of the Vegas Raiders? [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1488.68s)]
*  Like, Gino Smith. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1490.96s)]
*  Do you trade for Gino who has a great relationship with Pete Carroll? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1493.84s)]
*  If you're the Seahawks and you can get a high second round pick for Gino Smith, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1497.2s)]
*  and then spend 20 million a year on Sam Darnold for three years, and just invest [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1502.64s)]
*  in your offensive line and be like, if we can actually block for this guy with [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1507.3600000000001s)]
*  the guys we have, we can actually do, I would do that. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1511.44s)]
*  That's why this is fun. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1514.8s)]
*  It's such a weird class of quarterbacks because you have these, these potential [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1515.8s)]
*  Hall of Famers and Hall of Famers at the last stage of their career. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1520.16s)]
*  I mean, Cousins, we don't even know if he can move anymore, but he was going to be [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1523.1200000000001s)]
*  available if someone wants to trade for him. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1526.36s)]
*  He's more available for TV. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1527.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1530.28s)]
*  Russell Wilson. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1530.84s)]
*  You might be doing TV for him on network TBD in about six months. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1531.9599999999998s)]
*  Don't laugh. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1535.6399999999999s)]
*  Don't laugh. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1536.6s)]
*  Amy Poehler might have a pod right next to Russell Wilson's. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1537.04s)]
*  If we keep on going down, this is it. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1539.4799999999998s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1542.1599999999999s)]
*  No joke though. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1543.1999999999998s)]
*  Like this is the last stop on the tour and then you'd hope that you have a [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1543.84s)]
*  young guy that can come in as well. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1546.6s)]
*  And then there's like this middle tier. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1548.6399999999999s)]
*  I keep on saying Stidham's name. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1549.9199999999998s)]
*  I think Jared Stidham is going to make a ton of more money than anyone expects [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1551.28s)]
*  because he's this like 28 year old guy who's been in multiple systems. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1554.24s)]
*  And when he plays, plays well. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1557.44s)]
*  This is it. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1559.76s)]
*  Patriots fans. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1560.52s)]
*  If Jared Stidham makes more and more than any than Sam Darnold, what are we doing? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1561.64s)]
*  He won't make more than Sam Darnold, but he will be a coveted free agent more [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1565.4s)]
*  than you would imagine because of the dearth of quarterbacks available and how [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1568.96s)]
*  important the position is. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1573.24s)]
*  At this point, like go, go take a look at Joe Milton's week 18 game tape and talk [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1574.4s)]
*  yourself into that if we're going down to Jared Stidham. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1579.24s)]
*  Don't laugh. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1581.64s)]
*  I mean, Joe Milton went, what, what drown was he last year? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1582.28s)]
*  Fourth, fifth, sixth, Joe Milton could go for a fifth or fourth round pick. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1585.24s)]
*  Like he was, he was really good in that last game. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1588.88s)]
*  Let's take a break. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1590.92s)]

*  So quick tangent that I'm going to bring back to the NFL in the NBA, the [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1643.08s)]
*  bleakest situations right now are the sons and the Sixers and now the Mavericks [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1646.3999999999999s)]
*  who made this catastrophic Luca trade and then Kyrie's out for the year. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1651.36s)]
*  And it's just, you just look at those and you go, wow, this three, four year [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1655.4399999999998s)]
*  window here, pretty bleak who, in your opinion, like, especially like being [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1659.52s)]
*  around everybody last week, who are the bleak franchises other than the Browns? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1665.08s)]
*  We're just going to grandfather them in the Browns have to be number one bleak. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1670.68s)]
*  But who else is in that conversation? [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1673.72s)]
*  The Browns is bleak because their star player also is demanding a trade and they [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1675.68s)]
*  don't plan on trading them. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1679.76s)]
*  So you add on just, you know, terrible results in a question at quarterback. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1680.76s)]
*  And then you have the star player being unhappy. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1685.08s)]
*  So that's, that's the Browns. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1687.08s)]
*  That's would you, we say that's the gold standard of bleak right now. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1689.0s)]
*  It has to be. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1691.76s)]
*  Yeah, but they were in the playoffs two years ago and they do have young [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1692.72s)]
*  talent. So it's like, there's always this like, you know, hope Springs eternal. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1695.0s)]
*  We get the right quarterback. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1697.96s)]
*  Oh, the Browns fans feeling good all of a sudden. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1698.76s)]
*  They're like shrigs. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1701.24s)]
*  They're in on the Browns. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1702.2s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1703.72s)]
*  I'm in on all 32, as you know. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1704.12s)]
*  I think, I think the Jets situation is pretty bleak right now in that they got, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1706.12s)]
*  they feel like they got the right coach and they feel like they got the right GM. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1710.52s)]
*  But you've got a bunch of young players who are up for giant contract extensions [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1713.88s)]
*  in the next couple of years and you do not have a quarterback and you went down [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1718.6s)]
*  this road with Rogers. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1722.32s)]
*  And now it's like, we're sort of a good team with names on the roster, but we [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1723.48s)]
*  have nothing to show for it. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1728.0800000000002s)]
*  And we have a complete X factor at quarterback and we're just out of the top [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1729.24s)]
*  five to actually draft one that we could just pick. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1733.64s)]
*  We'd have to move and be, and be able to do that. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1736.56s)]
*  So to me, I think the Jets will be in on Justin Fields. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1738.56s)]
*  I don't know if Justin Fields would leave Pittsburgh to go to the Jets. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1742.68s)]
*  Now money talks, but even if you get Justin Fields and you like Justin Fields [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1745.56s)]
*  and you think you've seen things from Justin Fields, if you're a Jets fan, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1750.16s)]
*  are you, are you doing flips over? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1753.6000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1754.96s)]
*  We're now ready to take on Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes and Joe Burrow [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1755.24s)]
*  with Justin Fields and Drake May and Drake May. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1758.64s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1761.44s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1761.92s)]
*  Just feels so you'd have Jets. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1764.0800000000002s)]
*  Who else? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1766.24s)]
*  Cause I would say at least with the Jets, there's a lot of talent there. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1767.68s)]
*  There is, but you got moves. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1771.28s)]
*  You've got a pay sauce and Garrett and all these guys are going to be up for [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1773.44s)]
*  contracts and they had all these first, you know, Brice Hall, Jermaine Johnson, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1776.96s)]
*  uh, Garrett Wilson, you name it. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1781.72s)]
*  And then of course you mentioned, uh, they all gotta get paid if you want to keep them. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1784.12s)]
*  Well, they're already letting DJ Reid go, which I thought was kind of shocking. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1787.72s)]
*  He was good last year. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1791.28s)]
*  DJ Reid's a good player. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1792.6s)]
*  And he's going to be the pads. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1794.32s)]
*  DJ Reid. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1795.76s)]
*  Don't laugh. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1796.6399999999999s)]
*  I think the pats are going to be very aggressive and free agency. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1797.48s)]
*  And I think they're going to load up this year. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1799.76s)]
*  Wait, hold on. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1801.12s)]
*  I was going to end with the pats. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1801.6399999999999s)]
*  So Jets bleep Browns bleep. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1803.1599999999999s)]
*  Would you throw the saints in there? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1805.04s)]
*  Yes, because it looks like there's still a question with car, like his car, the [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1806.76s)]
*  quarterback, and they've got salary cap issues. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1810.72s)]
*  What's the question? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1812.8400000000001s)]
*  How much do we hate ourselves? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1814.16s)]
*  How much do we, do we keep them? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1815.64s)]
*  It sounds like they've, uh, you know, the comments that were made by, by Mickey [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1817.0400000000002s)]
*  Loomis at the, at the combine was that they're in on Derek Carr still. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1820.4s)]
*  And I thought he would be in that same boat as cousins and whatever. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1823.5600000000002s)]
*  And you could, if you're the Titans and you got Brian Callahan who coached [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1826.4s)]
*  Carr it with the, with the Raiders, it's like, all right, well, give us Derek [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1830.16s)]
*  Carr and we'll, we'll figure it out. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1834.4s)]
*  But it sounds like the saints are all in on Derek Carr and they still have these, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1836.0s)]
*  this bloated salary cap that they can't get out under. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1838.96s)]
*  So I think the saints is pretty bleak. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1841.0s)]
*  Wait, when you say he's in the same boat as Kurt Cousins, are you [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1843.24s)]
*  talking about the Titanic? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1846.1200000000001s)]
*  What boat is that? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1848.2s)]
*  Is that boat still floating? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1851.24s)]
*  We say this, we say this, and yet there are teams that are going to convince [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1852.6000000000001s)]
*  themselves that, oh, well, it's better than the alternative and we'll pay these [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1856.3600000000001s)]
*  guys real money. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1859.2s)]
*  Like that's where we're at. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1859.8400000000001s)]
*  What happened with the Raiders? [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1861.44s)]
*  Like, I mean, I think it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1862.5600000000002s)]
*  yeah. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1864.6799999999998s)]
*  It's not the whole point of physiotherapy to keep thinking about this. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1864.8s)]
*  And it's like, even things happen to Dusk September W mushrooms, like just [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1867.7s)]
*  a difference, just a, it's just an, you know, a, an edge that, you know, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1873.04s)]
*  someone had there because this isnt [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1879.6399999999999s)]
*  the CWD that time. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1886.48s)]
*  So everything that's been so super Would you say it is the Stri只是 [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1888.48s)]
*  that season, the team, the Raiders or avoids the Saims of them? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1892.2s)]
*  But, um, I would you go to cap situations? [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1894.0s)]
*  No good either. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1896.8s)]
*  Would you go bleak for the, for the Cowboys? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1898.0s)]
*  Semi bleak. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1901.88s)]
*  No medium bleak bleak in that. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1903.32s)]
*  It feels like the other two teams have surpassed them in their division and [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1906.8s)]
*  they're still going to have to pay Micah Parsons and they've got DAC on this [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1910.12s)]
*  contract and CD and like, I don't know how they're going to pay all these pending [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1913.48s)]
*  for agents that they have and that it's going in the wrong direction, but gosh, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1917.08s)]
*  you know, you hire, you don't even do a full search and it's like, we're just [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1921.1599999999999s)]
*  going to keep it going with Brian Schottenheimer. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1926.04s)]
*  It's hard to, it's hard to look at your fan base and say, well, it's totally [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1927.8799999999999s)]
*  going to be different. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1931.2399999999998s)]
*  Well, we just elevated the guy who was number two to Mike McCarthy and we're [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1932.0s)]
*  not going to have any new fresh talent besides what we already have. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1937.08s)]
*  And we missed the playoffs last year. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1940.0s)]
*  The question is how does DAC return from injury because he's the highest [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1941.2399999999998s)]
*  paid quarterback in the NFL. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1944.1599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1945.6799999999998s)]
*  Well, the off season, especially this part, and when we had an [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1946.3999999999999s)]
*  a free agency draft is all about how do I convince my fan base to, to be [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1949.24s)]
*  potentially excited about something and to pay out and the Cowboys can be like, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1955.3600000000001s)]
*  Hey, DAC's healthy. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1959.3600000000001s)]
*  We got Parsons. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1960.72s)]
*  We have three of the best players in the league. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1961.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1963.48s)]
*  We're the Cowboys. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1964.0800000000002s)]
*  I don't know what's the case for the Saints. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1965.68s)]
*  We have no, we have no cap space and Derek Carr's coming back and we hired the [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1968.52s)]
*  ninth coach who got hired and we're in the NFC South. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1974.6000000000001s)]
*  Never know. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1979.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1981.3600000000001s)]
*  And you're in a market that, you know, it's, it's a good team with a great [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1981.76s)]
*  tradition and a great city, but it's not like New Orleans is due to buy the NFL [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1986.68s)]
*  as like the Cowboys or the Giants or one of these premier franchises. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1990.68s)]
*  Do you feel like it's less bleak in Jacksonville or we just, it's better. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=1995.0800000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2000.68s)]
*  Give me, give me stuff on this. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2000.92s)]
*  It can go, this is like a social experiment in a lot of ways. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2002.12s)]
*  I went out of my way at the combine to meet a lot of these people that I'd never [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2006.08s)]
*  met before. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2009.24s)]
*  Um, that's always what I like to do. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2010.52s)]
*  I like to put a list down of like, here are 10 names. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2011.76s)]
*  They're all going to be in Indianapolis. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2014.08s)]
*  Get to know them. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2015.64s)]
*  They're young, they're up and coming. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2016.4s)]
*  And then you become friendly enough with them where over the years you bond a [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2017.56s)]
*  relationship and you form. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2020.76s)]
*  They, they hired a 28 year old offensive coordinator in Grant Udinski 28. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2022.52s)]
*  And I was doing the math in my head. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2028.88s)]
*  I'm like, all right, I know how old I am. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2030.2s)]
*  I know where I was like when, when OJ was on the chase and Ewing was playing a [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2031.8s)]
*  large one, he wasn't born yet. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2037.12s)]
*  And that's where I like, that's like, this is how young he is. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2038.56s)]
*  Josh McCown tells me he was with them in Minnesota. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2042.68s)]
*  This kid's brilliant, but that's your offensive coordinator. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2044.6399999999999s)]
*  Your head coach, Liam Cohen, who I've known, he was UMass quarterback. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2047.32s)]
*  And I wrote a book with Victor Cruz way back when in 2011. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2050.96s)]
*  And when Victor Cruz is like the sensation, his quarterback was, was [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2054.56s)]
*  Liam Cohen in college. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2058.2799999999997s)]
*  So I got to know Liam then when we were working on this book and I've seen [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2059.84s)]
*  Liam bounce, Liam is a young, really untested head coach, first time head coach. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2063.28s)]
*  So you got that too. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2067.7200000000003s)]
*  And then at GM, they hired a guy named James Gladstone who's 34 years old. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2068.92s)]
*  And he was with the, he was at the Rams and he was living in St. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2075.96s)]
*  Louis while the Rams were in LA. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2079.6800000000003s)]
*  And he kind of was doing the scouting from a satellite office, but he was less [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2081.2000000000003s)]
*  needs like number two and the Rams gave him a lot of credit for these recent [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2084.88s)]
*  drafts, including Puka Nakua and including some of these, the Braden Fisk [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2088.56s)]
*  and Jared verse that said, you're talking 34 year old GM, 28 year old offensive [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2093.72s)]
*  coordinator, first time head coach, and then a first time defensive coordinator [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2100.6s)]
*  and Anthony Campanile. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2105.2799999999997s)]
*  So to me, it's like, it's fun. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2106.6s)]
*  It's fresh. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2109.2s)]
*  It's different. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2109.92s)]
*  It's, it's not hiring urban Meyer or Doug Peterson. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2110.52s)]
*  It's a strategy. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2113.32s)]
*  We're young. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2114.36s)]
*  It is different. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2115.36s)]
*  And then, you know, Shad Khan, whatever. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2116.08s)]
*  And then like Tony Khan, I talked to at the, at the super bowl and it's like, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2118.24s)]
*  he's talking about wrestling to me. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2121.36s)]
*  And I think that's his priority is the AEW and he's like, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2122.52s)]
*  he writes every episode. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2126.44s)]
*  He runs it. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2127.64s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2128.04s)]
*  Shregs, his eyes are all darting all over the place. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2129.24s)]

*  MJF is going to knock you out with a Burberry scarf on. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2135.44s)]
*  He's probably trying to book Ian Rappaport and Schultz to have some sort of [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2139.68s)]
*  Starbucks match. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2143.16s)]

*  let's just do fresh eyes and young and hire guys. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2154.1600000000003s)]

*  worked for this guy and then we just hire him. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2163.88s)]

*  Okay. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2177.8s)]

*  Like I, I, and they're in intervision with the Bills. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2201.2000000000003s)]

*  Here, here's where I would say there's a possible turn in that. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2208.92s)]
*  Like, first of all, a lot of these teams, they show up at the combine, they do media [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2213.52s)]
*  maybe Tuesday, Wednesday, they fulfill that and they, they'll stay Thursday. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2219.28s)]
*  Then they're out of there. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2222.48s)]
*  Mike McDaniel, Chris Greer and Dan Marino were in that dolphin suite until the bitter, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2223.96s)]
*  bitter end when the offensive linemen were working out on Sunday. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2230.1200000000003s)]
*  Like, and they were locked in. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2233.32s)]
*  What's he doing? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2235.88s)]
*  Dan Marino's got an executive role right now with the dolphins working with the team. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2236.92s)]
*  And, and we're talking about former players and Tom Brady and all this stuff. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2241.0s)]
*  Now Dan Marino's he's present. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2244.52s)]
*  He's got a voice. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2246.76s)]
*  Um, they brought him back into the fold a couple of years ago and, and he was at [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2248.32s)]
*  the combine and fully engaged with all of it. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2251.6800000000003s)]
*  Now last year's draft, they, they, they hit with Chop Robinson. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2254.2400000000002s)]
*  He was really good for them as a rookie. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2258.92s)]
*  He was good. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2260.1600000000003s)]
*  I liked him. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2260.7200000000003s)]
*  Jalen Wright, the running back. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2261.4399999999996s)]
*  But to your point, when Tua went down, they weren't ready for that kind of [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2263.04s)]
*  adversity and things went off the rails. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2266.8399999999997s)]
*  And you saw Tyreek Hill and his comments in that final game about, you know, I, I, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2268.68s)]
*  it just was like desolate and it was the kind of thing you would never want to [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2273.08s)]
*  hear from a veteran leader. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2276.3599999999997s)]
*  That said, dolphins, they still have a ton of talent on that roster. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2278.0s)]
*  And I do think the players still respond to McDaniel. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2281.9199999999996s)]
*  So I'm not bleak on the dolphins. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2284.4799999999996s)]
*  And I'm not sure I think that, but. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2287.52s)]
*  Well, what do you think on Tua? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2289.68s)]
*  Like they paid him. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2291.04s)]
*  He was injured again. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2292.56s)]
*  I have real concerns about McDaniel. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2293.7200000000003s)]
*  I have real concerns about Tua and I have real concerns about we're going to wake [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2295.68s)]
*  up three days from now and Tyreek Hill is like, I want to be a charger. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2299.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2302.76s)]
*  Let's make that happen guys. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2302.96s)]
*  It would be the Chiefs, not the Chargers. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2304.44s)]
*  He's still like, he tweets every other day about how much he loves the Chiefs. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2305.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2309.4s)]
*  Is that even possible? [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2310.04s)]
*  The Chiefs just have an unlimited salary cap. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2311.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't know how they do it. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2313.36s)]
*  It's like, Hey, we're going to franchise tag our left guard. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2314.08s)]
*  And Andy's magic. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2316.48s)]
*  Andy will trade you away. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2317.48s)]
*  Andy will cut you. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2318.56s)]
*  And then, you know, the players long for Andy. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2319.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2321.4s)]
*  They want to go play for him again. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2321.96s)]
*  By the way, you saw the, you saw the John Cena, you know, dropping the mic. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2324.0800000000004s)]
*  You saw that that's, that's my homes this year. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2328.32s)]
*  That's, that's, that's where he's at right now. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2331.0800000000004s)]
*  I think like he's gone villain. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2332.7200000000003s)]
*  Like everyone just, I think we're going to have a different, this is going to be a [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2334.04s)]
*  fun year coming back. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2337.32s)]
*  An incredibly disappointing season by his statutes last year. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2337.6800000000003s)]
*  The Superbowl was a disaster. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2340.2400000000002s)]
*  So I hope he's motivated. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2341.6400000000003s)]
*  Um, the anti-bleak watch, the, you go to combine and these teams are like, it's [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2343.6s)]
*  like the sky is opened. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2350.7999999999997s)]
*  It's after it's rained for a week straight and all of a sudden it's the first sunny [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2352.4s)]
*  day and everybody's like, I want to go outside. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2356.72s)]
*  We don't have to talk about the paths. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2359.24s)]
*  I talk about them too much. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2360.4s)]
*  We can, we can do that at the very end, but who else is in that? [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2361.4s)]
*  Washington. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2365.04s)]
*  The skies have opened. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2365.56s)]
*  Washington. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2366.6s)]
*  It is like, it is like, like the angels. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2367.44s)]
*  And last year at the combine, I interviewed Adam Peters on camera. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2370.2s)]
*  He's a GM coming from San Francisco. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2373.8399999999997s)]
*  First time GM super nervous on NFL network beforehand. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2375.3999999999996s)]
*  What questions are we going to do? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2379.08s)]
*  Like, and then this year comes in all swagged out has like, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2380.3599999999997s)]
*  you know, he's wearing the polinka jacket. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2384.72s)]
*  He's got the jacket. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2387.2799999999997s)]
*  He's got the custom Jordans. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2388.3999999999996s)]
*  He comes in. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2390.2s)]
*  He's like, ask me anything. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2390.72s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2392.16s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2392.92s)]
*  They trade. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2393.8399999999997s)]
*  Ask me how great Jay did Daniel's in. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2394.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm just having to talk about that. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2396.44s)]
*  They have a ton of salary caps face. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2399.0s)]
*  Everyone loves their coach. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2401.08s)]
*  Like Dan Quinn's got that Andy Reid thing where like tires just love them. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2402.36s)]
*  And, you know, they just trade for Debo. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2405.6s)]
*  And I do want to say this. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2407.92s)]
*  I think people misread the NFL. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2409.48s)]
*  Like the Cowboys got crushed because they traded a fourth rounder for Jonathan [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2411.08s)]
*  Mingo and everyone's like, how could you, how could you trade a fourth rounder [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2415.72s)]
*  for Mingo and they trade a, a, a, and they get Debo. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2418.72s)]
*  They're taking on Debo Samuel's entire contract. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2422.6s)]
*  So that's the salary. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2424.7599999999998s)]
*  Don't deny it. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2425.7599999999998s)]
*  So it was basically them cutting them. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2426.52s)]
*  And that was the team that was willing to take it. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2428.44s)]
*  And Adam Peters drafted Debo in San Fran and Anthony Lynn coached them. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2430.32s)]
*  And Cliff is like, please bring up like he'll be motivated and we'll make it work. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2434.0s)]
*  Can I give you my, can I give you my 32nd Debo take as an intermission? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2438.48s)]
*  San Francisco being like, yeah, we're good. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2444.68s)]
*  Take them. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2446.6s)]
*  It reminded me of the Celtics with Marcus smart. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2447.8s)]
*  And this is where I bring the Celtics into a football podcast. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2450.92s)]
*  Like they knew something. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2453.68s)]
*  Well, it was. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2455.32s)]
*  And watching him, and this was the case we're still on. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2456.52s)]
*  I made on the podcast after that trade. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2458.68s)]
*  It was like that dude's body's been through a lot. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2460.4s)]
*  We watched him for the last nine years. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2463.04s)]
*  He took a million charges. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2465.24s)]
*  He was on the floor all the time. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2467.3199999999997s)]
*  And I think they're getting out a year too early instead of a [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2469.6s)]
*  year too late with his body. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2472.0s)]
*  So what happens? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2473.16s)]
*  He goes to Memphis, he breaks down and he has not been healthy ever since. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2473.8399999999997s)]
*  I think he's working playing now. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2477.3199999999997s)]
*  I saw a picture of him this week. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2478.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2480.64s)]
*  He's like a veteran on Washington. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2480.7999999999997s)]
*  So I look at Debo and like you, I watch football every week. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2482.3199999999997s)]
*  Debo took a fucking ton of hits. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2486.16s)]
*  The way they used him, he was like a crash test dummy. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2488.92s)]
*  And I just wonder if they were like, ah, I think we took this as far as we can go. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2492.16s)]
*  Let, if it starts to dip, it could be on somebody else's team. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2496.16s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2499.92s)]
*  You're right. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2500.68s)]
*  But in the same breath, like Washington knows what they're inheriting. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2501.2s)]
*  Like Cliff watched every snap of Debo. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2504.12s)]
*  That's like, it's like this incredible toy for Cliff. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2505.8399999999997s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2508.48s)]
*  He cannot wait. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2509.08s)]
*  And he's like, please. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2509.56s)]
*  And also he's going to have 40 Debo plays. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2510.4s)]
*  And also he was 20 pounds overweight, whatever you want to say. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2512.8399999999997s)]
*  Like, and now he's going into the final year of his contract. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2515.84s)]
*  Give me a motivated chip on his shoulder and a contract to your Debo. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2518.36s)]
*  Like, sure. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2521.84s)]
*  So like, it wasn't like it was a false. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2522.28s)]
*  It was like you on TV last year. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2523.84s)]
*  That was same thing. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2525.28s)]
*  I just felt like a giant chip on your shoulder. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2526.04s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2527.92s)]
*  You want to disrespect Debo and Schrager, you're going to get the best of us. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2528.96s)]
*  I'll do anything. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2533.6400000000003s)]
*  I'll do any hit. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2535.36s)]
*  Send me anywhere. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2536.48s)]
*  Contract here. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2537.88s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2539.08s)]
*  The, uh, so the Washington thing, the vibes are unbelievable. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2540.1600000000003s)]
*  Um, great coach, great GM. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2543.4s)]
*  Franchise QB most beloved guy in Washington, even more than Ovechkin. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2545.44s)]
*  House is like, can't even come up with somebody on par with him at this point. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2550.16s)]
*  You have to go back to like the Gibbs era. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2553.84s)]
*  Uh, who else is the skies apart? [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2555.6s)]
*  Sky another team. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2558.84s)]
*  Sky, did you say Chargers, Rosie, Rosie Chargers or not? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2560.36s)]
*  Season ended weird that lost to Houston. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2564.52s)]
*  So there's kind of like a bad taste and also might be out. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2567.08s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't say Chargers. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2570.6s)]
*  I'm trying to think and go, Oh, Denver, Denver, those guys. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2572.4s)]
*  Denver, they are super high on what they've got. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2575.48s)]
*  All young players, Bo Nicks. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2578.08s)]
*  Uh, I had a really cool opportunity Friday night. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2580.2s)]
*  Um, the Broncos do a team dinner at the combine and it's everyone from the team [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2582.6s)]
*  doctor to, to the, the head coach, to like the intern, anyone who's in Indian [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2586.24s)]
* apolis, I'd say 60 people and Sean Payton, you know, does a big team dinner. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2591.12s)]
*  I don't think any other teams do this in this way. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2594.92s)]
*  And they rent out a room at prime 47, which is the big steakhouse and Payton, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2597.08s)]
*  let me come in and just hang with them at the table. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2601.2s)]
*  Like when you feel like good vibes, good vibes team, it's everyone's busting balls. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2603.4s)]
*  Everyone's laughing. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2609.2400000000002s)]
*  Everyone is like having a great, and they have such confidence in this quarterback [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2610.2000000000003s)]
*  that they're like, we're set. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2615.2000000000003s)]
*  Like this has been the Albatross around this franchise since Peyton Manning left. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2616.28s)]
*  We finally got our guy and they will be active in free agency and they will get [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2620.08s)]
*  a good running back and a little more money this year, right? [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2624.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2627.28s)]
*  And finally have money. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2627.48s)]
*  They've had no money, but like upfront last year, like Zach Allen had a career [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2628.32s)]
*  year when they're paying him, you know, but Alex Singleton was great. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2631.96s)]
*  Like, and then they've got Sertan this amazing corner. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2634.7200000000003s)]
*  They're set. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2637.64s)]
*  They are going to get a running back in this draft. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2638.84s)]
*  And that's always been Sean Payton's like favorite position to tinker with. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2640.7200000000003s)]
*  And they haven't had, he calls it the joker. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2644.2s)]
*  It's like the Alvin Camaro, the Darren Sprouls, the Pierre Thomas, that type, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2646.68s)]
*  the guy that can catch out of the backfield, run in the backfield. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2650.64s)]
*  So there's good like high second round running back candidates for that. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2652.8s)]
*  Yeah, great running back draft. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2656.92s)]
*  And you can sit there and on day two, pick up a guy who's going to pick up [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2659.12s)]
*  a thousand yards and you know, 60 catches. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2662.2799999999997s)]
*  So I'd say Denver and Washington, both based on the young quarterback and then [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2664.2s)]
*  New England, you don't want to talk about him, but like the optimism is sky high [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2668.04s)]
*  around the Patriots and also they become. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2672.08s)]
*  Me and nephew Kyle and every time we're together, Kyle's like Kyle's waiting for [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2673.8s)]
*  Abdul Carter to fall to four because of some amorphous foot thing. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2678.44s)]
*  And then he's buying the Jersey like that day. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2681.72s)]
*  It's like it become all of a sudden a desirable place to play too. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2684.12s)]
*  And the free agent. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2688.0s)]
*  Funny how that works when you have a good quarterback and a good coach. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2688.76s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2691.6s)]
*  It's funny how that shifts. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2692.08s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2693.36s)]
*  You know, the fourth overall pick is interesting for them because Hunter or [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2694.12s)]
*  Carter could be there if the quarterbacks do go in the top four and even if they [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2698.64s)]
*  don't, I think Will Howard's a real possibility or yeah, the lineman from LSU. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2701.8s)]
*  Oh, Will Campbell. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2707.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2707.96s)]
*  Campbell, sorry. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2708.28s)]
*  Not the Ohio State quarterback. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2709.04s)]
*  No, but then he had the short arms. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2710.08s)]
*  I was on multiple short arm threats. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2711.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2713.8s)]
*  So you couldn't even get to 33 inches with this reach. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2714.56s)]
*  How's it going to hold back Mike Parsons with those short arms? [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2717.84s)]
*  The other two names, Odie Mason Graham, who I think you're you're high on, right? [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2720.8s)]
*  I'm high on Michigan. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2724.68s)]
*  Now I'm at McShay says there's three league guys in the draft and that was how I [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2725.6s)]
*  was feeling anyway, knowing nothing, but doing all the prep and it just feels like, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2730.68s)]
*  but the thing is with defensive tackle, that's the easiest position to get in [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2734.2400000000002s)]
*  free agency. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2737.32s)]
*  There's a million of them. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2737.96s)]
*  True. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2739.0s)]
*  If you're trying to put together a team of assets, which is what they need to do. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2739.56s)]
*  That's probably not where you go, but I want to know. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2744.68s)]
*  I want an all pro in this draft. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2747.88s)]
*  You have to get an all pro in this draft. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2749.48s)]
*  So I'm going to put this out here now because his draft stock is slipping because [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2751.16s)]
*  he didn't do anything at the combine. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2754.0s)]
*  And also I don't think for overall is so crazy for this Chita Rora McMillan out [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2755.36s)]
*  of Arizona, also known as TMAC. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2761.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2764.0s)]
*  Oh, there's a lot of fans in the league and you're talking about the comparison [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2764.64s)]
*  starts at Drake London, but it can go even higher. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2769.44s)]
*  This huge wingspan and this huge upside six foot six basketball body out of Arizona. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2772.08s)]
*  Jed fish was his coach at, at Arizona and Jed fish is a lot of NFL people. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2779.68s)]
*  And he has been raving about this guy for years. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2785.08s)]
*  Didn't do anything at the combine, but interviewed everywhere. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2788.12s)]
*  And apparently he's a great kid. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2790.6s)]
*  Nickname is TMAC. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2792.12s)]
*  I don't see him in the top 10 of any of these mock drafts. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2793.28s)]
*  And I know that everyone loves what Matthew Golden, the wide receiver out of [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2795.64s)]
*  Texas did and is like, he's the guy. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2799.44s)]
*  I would be shocked if TMAC falls out of the top 10 and I would think [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2801.48s)]
*  Patriots at four might be a little rich. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2804.24s)]
*  But if you're, that's a trade back. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2806.2s)]
*  That's you flip picks with the jets or the saints or whoever. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2808.64s)]
*  And you, or the even Vegas. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2812.2s)]
*  Are you scarred by, by a Keanu? [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2814.2s)]
*  Uh, what's his name by Nicole, Nikhil Harry of going to the [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2816.64s)]
*  state of Arizona for a wide receiver. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2819.92s)]
*  The only thing that worries me with TMAC is the wide receiver class is so bad. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2822.16s)]
*  That when somebody is the best looking person at a party of ugly people, they [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2826.5600000000004s)]
*  look fucking so handsome or beautiful. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2831.28s)]
*  You should see it, dude. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2836.36s)]
*  You would walk into one of these steak houses. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2837.5600000000004s)]
*  You would vomit. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2839.48s)]
*  It is so ugly. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2840.2000000000003s)]
*  And it's all over the country. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2841.2000000000003s)]
*  It's all of us in the media and everyone's got the same exact look. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2842.88s)]
*  It's a button down with an ill fitting blazer and jeans. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2846.2000000000003s)]
*  And like, it sounds great. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2849.7200000000003s)]
*  And like maybe someone trying to have like a cool pair of Jordans doesn't work, [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2851.1600000000003s)]
*  but like that's, that's the look. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2855.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2856.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, but that's what worries me. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2857.12s)]
*  But if they want him, I think you he's in the eight to 12 range. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2859.0s)]
*  Um, I don't think they can take, they, well, the team that I could see taking [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2862.72s)]
*  him is Jacksonville at five, because it seems like it's their decades mission to [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2867.9599999999996s)]
*  just keep spending capital on wide receivers to try to talk themselves into Trevor Lawrence. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2871.9599999999996s)]
*  The Patriots can't block. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2876.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm just going to say that they can't take Will Campbell at four because we don't [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2877.9599999999996s)]
*  know if he's a left tackle or guard, but I think, I think that moving back into the [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2881.88s)]
*  six to 10 range and taking a receiver tackle, it's hard to argue with, but you'd [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2886.4s)]
*  have to find a team wanting to move up. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2891.04s)]
*  It's also like, and I work for the NFL network and I'm going to be doing the [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2894.28s)]
*  draft, like it is not the draft class of years prior. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2897.1200000000003s)]
*  There are, you said three blue chip guys. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2900.52s)]
*  And I think Mason Graham is borderline blue chip. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2903.1600000000003s)]
*  Like Travis Hunter. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2905.28s)]
*  I can see Carter for the Pats though. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2907.1200000000003s)]
*  Oh dude. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2909.1600000000003s)]
*  I think if there's a scenario where people get worried about, well, what's [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2909.7999999999997s)]
*  coming out of this foot or any of that shit and two quarterbacks go in the top [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2913.08s)]
*  three and Hunter goes at like, it's, that would be the dream. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2917.0s)]
*  It's Carter McInnis the 96, all 95 or 94 whenever he got him all over again. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2921.4399999999996s)]
*  Did Willie, did Willie fall in the draft for Parcells? [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2926.72s)]
*  No, but we took him like fourth or fifth. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2928.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2931.0s)]
*  And it was like, Hey, this guy is like going to be our, this guy is going to go [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2931.2799999999997s)]
*  chase the quarterback now for the next 10 years for you guys. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2934.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2937.3199999999997s)]
*  Carter would be a home run and it's him and Hunter are like the two names. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2937.56s)]
*  And then you got this other bucket of the quarterbacks where if you're [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2941.2s)]
*  doing an overall players list, they're probably seven, eight, nine, 10. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2943.88s)]
*  Like if you want to go that way, they're not. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2947.2s)]
*  And then it's just the great unknown. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2949.04s)]
*  And it's like, what do you prefer? [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2951.04s)]
*  And it's, I mean, truly after like the fifth or sixth pick, it is a complete [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2952.6s)]
*  crapshoot to like pick 38, they say, as far as like ranking and stacking these [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2956.7599999999998s)]
*  players, so not the richest draft class, but it's also the most intriguing. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2960.8s)]
*  At the combine, we did bleak. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2965.56s)]
*  We did happy. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2967.4s)]
*  Who's the, what the fuck is that team doing team that people were just [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2969.48s)]
*  kind of gossiping about? [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2974.4s)]
*  Like they were like, you know, the friend in the ex the friend in the neighborhood [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2976.84s)]
*  who were like, what's going on in that house? [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2981.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2984.08s)]
*  Just saw some car out there at three in the morning. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2984.64s)]
*  What, what? [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2986.64s)]
*  Cincinnati is a little bit of a question mark just because they have such a big [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2987.64s)]
*  off season ahead and it's, it's really going to be a lot of cap gymnastics, but [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2991.48s)]
*  they have told every agent, they have told every team, like their goal is to [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2996.2000000000003s)]
*  bring all three of these guys back. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=2999.36s)]
*  And that's Jamar chase T Higgins and Trey Hendrickson franchise tagged Higgins [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3000.88s)]
*  already, but the intention is not to have him play on another franchise. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3005.64s)]
*  Tagging. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3009.32s)]
*  The intention for them is to sign all three of these guys to long-term deals. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3009.56s)]
*  And if I was to stack it, I would say Jamar chase is their first priority. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3012.84s)]
*  T Higgins is their second priority. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3016.4s)]
*  And Trey Hendrickson, who led the NFL in Saxon was second overall and [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3018.08s)]
*  defensive player of the year. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3022.6s)]
*  He would be probably the third priority, which makes him a [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3023.52s)]
*  potential free agent to be signed. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3026.16s)]
*  Wow. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3029.44s)]
*  So we always talk about how you can basically afford three giant guys in the [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3030.0s)]
*  NFL, the way they want all three. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3034.56s)]
*  And if you can pull off four, well, you got to count burrow though. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3036.24s)]
*  Burrows have this huge contract and burrow. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3039.36s)]
*  So if you're doing burrow with the two receivers, that's an insane use of cap. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3041.92s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3047.28s)]
*  And also they just waived Alex Capa too. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3048.2400000000002s)]
*  They waived Alex Capa, which was a great year, but, but they're [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3051.1600000000003s)]
*  going to have a bunch of guys already. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3054.48s)]
*  They're going to have to, they're going to have to wave guys. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3055.88s)]
*  And I can't build a team around a quarterback and two receivers. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3058.36s)]
*  I can't expect that's going to work. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3061.04s)]
*  They're going to try. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3062.52s)]
*  And they're cheap. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3063.36s)]
*  They're like the pats. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3064.2000000000003s)]
*  They're cheap. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3065.04s)]
*  I mean, Brabels try to change the pats, but Bengals are cheap. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3065.6400000000003s)]
*  Pats are cheap. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3068.44s)]
*  So on top of, at least the chiefs are like spending when they try to do this. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3069.12s)]
*  They would bristle at the cheap thing. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3072.7200000000003s)]
*  I think historically they're viewed as cheap. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3074.2400000000002s)]
*  So Mike Brown's granddaughter, Mike Brown's granddaughter, Elizabeth Blackburn, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3075.76s)]
*  who's a Katie Blackburn, Elizabeth is the granddaughter of Mike Brown. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3080.32s)]
*  She's now taking over a little bit more and like, it's all about, let's make this [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3085.0800000000004s)]
*  team fun, let's make this team marketable and let's spend money. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3088.6000000000004s)]
*  Like let's spend money. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3091.1600000000003s)]
*  We have it. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3092.0800000000004s)]
*  We have to have a cap thing. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3092.7200000000003s)]
*  So like that's their intention, but Duke Tobin and Zach Taylor have a giant, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3093.6800000000003s)]
*  giant few weeks ahead of them right now. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3098.5600000000004s)]
*  And like, you already saw that Jamar Chase is posting things and T Higgins [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3100.2000000000003s)]
*  is posting things. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3104.4s)]
*  Burrow will be a dick. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3105.08s)]
*  Don't you think like if it gets to the point, he will put, he will be like an [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3106.08s)]
*  NBA star putting pressure on them. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3109.6s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3111.56s)]
*  He already has been publicly, you know, you don't do radio row interviews and [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3111.96s)]
*  talk about company business. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3115.4s)]
*  He was doing that. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3116.6800000000003s)]
*  So I think Cincinnati, a lot of eyes are on them because historically they have [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3117.64s)]
*  this, this feeling of, you know, small market team, 32nd market, they don't [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3121.6800000000003s)]
*  spend money, it's a family run business. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3126.16s)]
*  And now you finally have put yourself in this position where like, you have to pay [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3128.08s)]
*  up, there's nothing, it's, it's not going to be good feelings. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3131.12s)]
*  It's not going to be about, it's going to be money. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3133.52s)]
*  Are you going to spend the money and do you have a way to use the cap gymnastics? [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3135.36s)]
*  And to that point they put up 40 points. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3138.64s)]
*  They put up 40 points every game last year and they still lost. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3141.88s)]
*  So if you're focusing on offense and you're letting the defensive player of the [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3144.12s)]
*  year, the runner up walk out is where your priority is at. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3147.6s)]
*  So it's Luian Marrero's fault. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3150.48s)]
*  The Higgins chase when they play together with Burrow, the numbers are undeniable. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3152.48s)]
*  They're undeniable. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3160.68s)]
*  And they're also the most entertaining team in the league. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3161.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3164.44s)]
*  But if you're looking at Higgins and Schiele had him as his number two free agent, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3165.2s)]
*  he had Darnold number one only because there's no quarterbacks. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3168.68s)]
*  But the Higgins thing would be, well, what about the games without chase? [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3172.64s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3177.12s)]
*  And you look at those, what happens when the defense is targeted against him [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3178.36s)]
*  versus I think T Higgins is amazing. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3182.12s)]
*  I think that'd be my dream Pats guy. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3185.68s)]
*  I wouldn't give up the first pick for him, obviously, but the second pick, the [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3188.08s)]
*  second rounder I would do in a heartbeat. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3191.32s)]
*  Go watch what he did with Jake Browning last year at the end of the season. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3192.52s)]
*  They were going to T Higgins on every big play against Minnesota on that [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3196.6400000000003s)]
*  Saturday game and like Higgins is a true number one and if they can get both [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3199.2400000000002s)]
*  those guys back, great back to Darnold really quick. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3203.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3206.52s)]
*  If you're Minnesota and they're not franchise time, they're going to hit the [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3206.7200000000003s)]
*  market. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3210.1200000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3211.32s)]
*  You, what does it say to JJ McCarthy? [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3212.28s)]
*  If you do bring him back on a 25 to $30 million contract, does it tell the [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3214.48s)]
*  rest of the league that JJ McCarthy were not like, this is the bind with [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3219.4s)]
*  Minnesota. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3222.92s)]
*  Like they don't know what they have in JJ McCarthy and you could read all the [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3223.4s)]
*  positive press. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3226.6s)]
*  Like they don't know what they have in JJ McCarthy. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3227.28s)]
*  He was injured all last year. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3229.4s)]
*  He was on the sidelines. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3230.6s)]
*  Like they haven't seen him play. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3231.44s)]
*  So it's not like they know that if you take a guy in the top 10, he's got to be [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3232.44s)]
*  your quarterback. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3236.6800000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3238.56s)]
*  So you let, you let Darnell walk out the door. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3239.32s)]
*  You don't, you don't say, let's try to. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3242.2400000000002s)]
*  Two for 35. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3244.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3246.44s)]
*  Do you have it out after one year? [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3247.28s)]
*  Like one of those type of deals. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3249.44s)]
*  And if you're Darnold, you know, you played your best football with Kevin [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3250.96s)]
*  O'Connell. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3254.64s)]
*  Let me do it one more year. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3254.96s)]
*  And then I, then I can maybe break the bank. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3256.2400000000002s)]
*  Like, I think, I think they're going to make a very concerted effort. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3258.64s)]
*  I'm Darnold. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3261.52s)]
*  I'm like, by the way, I had COVID those last two games. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3262.2000000000003s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3264.52s)]
*  Sorry guys. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3265.1600000000003s)]
*  I was under the weather. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3265.8s)]
*  I can't believe you guys didn't get sick. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3267.2000000000003s)]
*  Why'd you make me play? [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3268.84s)]
*  Should it make me nervous that the Pats are probably going to spend on Ronnie [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3272.04s)]
*  Stanley because I still don't understand why the Ravens would let Ronnie Stanley [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3275.7200000000003s)]
*  go as their left tackle. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3279.36s)]
*  It's the Ravens have a different salary cap situation and different team and [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3281.04s)]
*  Ronnie Stanley can still play. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3284.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3285.6s)]
*  I mean, if I'm the Patriots, I'm looking at Zach Bond. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3286.6400000000003s)]
*  If the Eagles let him out, I I'm looking at Josh Sweatt. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3290.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm looking at Milton Williams. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3293.6800000000003s)]
*  Like they said they didn't like Josh Sweatt. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3294.84s)]
*  I think, I think Bond is a real possibility though. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3296.28s)]
*  Bond would be great. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3299.2000000000003s)]
*  And Sweatt is good. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3300.04s)]
*  And like Milton Williams is good. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3301.08s)]
*  The other name, I don't know if Nick Bolton from the Chiefs, like [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3302.08s)]
*  unbelievable linebacker. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3306.04s)]
*  Is he available? [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3307.08s)]
*  He's, he think they can get Nick Bolton. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3308.08s)]
*  I mean, it's Robert Spillane. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3310.04s)]
*  Like these are like real names that can add to this team. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3311.52s)]
*  Well, the move is what you, what the commanders did last year. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3313.96s)]
*  That are in those guys that weren't the A-list guys, but they were like, it's [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3318.12s)]
*  almost like the white lotus cast strategy. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3321.92s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3324.0s)]
*  It's like, we're going to get Carrie Coon. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3324.68s)]
*  She's a really good at yeah. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3326.36s)]
*  Carrie Coon's a really good actress. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3327.64s)]
*  Washington just went out and got like nine Carrie Coons. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3329.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3331.52s)]
*  So that makes Zach Ertz your Patrick Schwarzenegger. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3331.7599999999998s)]
*  I think so. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3334.12s)]
*  I think that works. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3335.04s)]
*  Austin Eckler starring as Leslie Bibb. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3336.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3339.84s)]
*  Austin Eckler is Greg Gary, the guy, the evil guy. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3340.08s)]
*  I mean, that guy's been in all three seasons and I mean, just consistently [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3344.64s)]
*  doesn't say a word on the episodes. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3349.12s)]
*  Just looks at the camera. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3350.56s)]
*  He has that and he has, he was the drug dealer 90210. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3351.48s)]
*  He's got one of the great IMDb's of all time. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3354.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3356.6s)]

*  Khalil Mack. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3359.72s)]
*  What are the chargers doing? [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3360.7599999999998s)]
*  Bose and Mack? [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3361.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3362.72s)]
*  Abloated. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3363.48s)]
*  Could they lose both? [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3363.96s)]
*  Salary. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3364.64s)]
*  They could. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3365.44s)]
*  They could. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3366.48s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3367.64s)]
*  That's why I'm not like, I want to wait and see on that. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3368.16s)]
*  And this is also Joe Hortiz who comes from the Ravens. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3370.12s)]
*  It's his first real off season. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3373.2s)]
*  Last year he was the GM and they drafted well, but like this is now you gotta, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3374.7999999999997s)]
*  you know, it's time to make some decisions that might not be as easy as [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3378.64s)]
*  just drafting and signing players. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3382.08s)]
*  Last question. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3384.2s)]
*  Houston is the most interesting off season team to me, because I don't know [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3385.16s)]
*  how far away they are from being impactful. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3388.48s)]
*  I thought they were in the mix last year, especially if you look back [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3391.8399999999997s)]
*  at how the season went, how they were able to play against the chiefs [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3396.64s)]
*  defensively, what they were missing feels easy to, easy to add. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3399.9599999999996s)]
*  I like their coaching staff. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3405.48s)]
*  I like their division. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3406.9599999999996s)]
*  They're in a great division. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3408.16s)]
*  Like that, that could easily be like a 14 and three team next year. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3409.3199999999997s)]
*  Um, you were high on them last year. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3413.0s)]
*  I was. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3415.2s)]
*  And they actually finished strong. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3415.9199999999996s)]
*  No, they finished strong. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3417.2799999999997s)]
*  And they ended up in the final eight team. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3418.4399999999996s)]
*  They lost two receivers by the time. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3420.3999999999996s)]
*  Diggs will be a free agent likely. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3422.68s)]
*  Like he's going to be gone. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3424.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3424.9199999999996s)]
*  What was really interesting to me was Bobby Slowick was one of the [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3425.64s)]
*  offensive masterminds, interviewing for head coaching jobs two years ago after [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3428.7599999999998s)]
*  they had this great sequential season. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3431.9199999999996s)]
*  They didn't think they got enough out of the offense. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3433.9599999999996s)]
*  They fired their offensive coordinator and then they go to the Rams and they [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3435.8799999999997s)]
*  get Nick Kaley, who was, uh, you know, wonder kind under Sean McVay, they bring [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3439.3199999999997s)]
*  Kaylee in and they also, with this offense, like they didn't have, Vicky said, [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3445.0s)]
*  Stefan Diggs, they didn't have Tank Dell in the last few weeks of the season. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3450.44s)]
*  And they still in that chief's game, move the ball up and down the field. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3453.76s)]
*  If they don't have two botched, uh, special teams plays and a block kick [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3457.52s)]
*  and get sacked eight times, like they they're in that game. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3462.68s)]
*  In retrospect, that was the red flag game for the Superbowl looking back as I [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3466.64s)]
*  still continue to kick myself for not just having the balls take Philly. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3470.76s)]
*  You've mentioned this on quite a few pods. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3473.84s)]
*  That Houston game was, was a bad sign for the chiefs. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3475.76s)]
*  No, that game. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3480.2000000000003s)]
*  They hung around like they did with the, I don't know. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3480.88s)]
*  Block field goals, muffed kickoffs. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3483.7200000000003s)]
*  Like they got everything from the Texans and they couldn't put them away until [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3486.1200000000003s)]
*  the very end. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3489.32s)]
*  So there was some, some red flags there, but what are you going to do? [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3490.0s)]
*  I've been, I, I, I didn't bet, but I picked, I picked the chiefs to win [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3493.88s)]
*  the Nets, you were both too. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3496.96s)]
*  And I've heard from Philly fans the entire last month, so it's all good. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3497.7200000000003s)]
*  We have to go. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3501.28s)]
*  I have to go talk to Wesley Morris about the Oscars. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3501.84s)]
*  Oscars. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3504.6000000000004s)]
*  Can I tell you proudly have not seen any of these movies. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3505.1600000000003s)]
*  Now I'll go see one of them. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3507.52s)]
*  I'll go see a great move. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3508.44s)]
*  Oh, Nora's good. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3510.2000000000003s)]
*  You should see it. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3510.84s)]
*  Nora. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3511.36s)]
*  Is it good? [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3511.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3512.4s)]
*  Shrinks we'll talk to you before the draft. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3513.1200000000003s)]
*  Great to see you as always. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3514.76s)]
*  You're the man Bill. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3515.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWq-vnCgp0&t=3516.56s)]
