# Five Favorites: Green Bay’s Tasty Win Total + Other NFL Futures | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [August 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE)
*  All right. We're starting a new segment here on the BS podcast. It's called five favorites. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=0.0s)]
*  House didn't know about this. Did I tell you about this house? You did not, but I'm thrilled to be [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=4.48s)]
*  here, especially with our boy, the Bundle and BS. I want you to help me. Let's get a nickname for [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=9.28s)]
*  the Bundle. I, to Bundle is such a good name in his own right. It's a great name. Anthony, Anthony [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=15.52s)]
*  to Bundle is here. If you listen to the ringer gambling show, he joined us this summer. He is [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=21.36s)]
*  to call him a jack of all trades would be an understatement. Soccer, baseball, football is [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=26.56s)]
*  really his main thing, but it's really all the sports like that. I still love the fact that the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=33.04s)]
*  Bundle that you follow all baseball, like nobody watches all baseball anymore. How's that? I just [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=37.84s)]
*  watch our own teams. I have no idea what's going on with any other team. You're following all this [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=44.08s)]
*  stuff. You're also young, which I think you have way more energy than us, but what's your favorite [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=48.24s)]
*  out of all the sports? Cause when I first saw you, you were crushing it on football. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=53.44s)]
*  You're putting up like one pick a week on I think Mondays or Tuesdays and you were like 70, 75%. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=58.16s)]
*  And I'm like, who is this dude? How is he doing this? So is football your favorite or is it another [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  one? You know, by virtue of the popularity of football, it's always going to be number one, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=70.16s)]
*  just based on how this country consumes sports. But I do love kind of the zag energy of, of being a [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=75.44s)]
*  huge soccer fan and Sarutti can attest to this too. We've been doing a soccer show there all [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=81.04s)]
*  summer on the gambling feed. And it's fun to embrace that side of it because there's so much [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=85.36000000000001s)]
*  pageantry and European beauty to the game. But in terms of like number one, every Sunday from one to [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=89.84s)]
*  11, I'm on the couch watching games. Like the NFL blocks off most of my fall. And yes, it's the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  perk of being really young and really single and having a lot of free time that I'm able to follow [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=103.92s)]
*  all these sports for now. House is asleep on the couch at various parts from one to 11, but it's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=109.6s)]
*  still joining you during that, uh, that football bench. Hey, so we brought you on for five favorites. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=115.36s)]
*  I asked you to pick right now. We're four weeks away. It's taping this on a Thursday afternoon. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=122.16s)]
*  We are four weeks away from day one NFL season Thursday night. I can't wait. House, I missed it [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=128.88s)]
*  so much. I told you this, this was the year that I think I decided I liked football more than [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=137.12s)]
*  basketball. I can't believe I've gotten here. We had this conversation, you know, we, we could have [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  done a podcast about it, how we're looking back across the span of our lives, the sports that were [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=147.28s)]
*  important to us. And basketball has been the thing that has cemented our relationship over these many [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=152.56s)]
*  decades, but here we are. It's football, baby. I love it so much. I'm so ready for it. Yeah. I'm not [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  like on September 15th, I'm not going to be like, Oh my God, five more weeks until the NBA. I'll be [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=164.64s)]
*  excited. Yeah. Football. I'm like, my wife has already looking at me side-eyed. She's like, I [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=169.27999999999997s)]
*  know you have, I know I have you for four more weeks and then I'm just probably going to hate [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=174.55999999999997s)]
*  your guts on Thursdays and Sundays and Mondays. And now we're going to have Wednesday games and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=178.48s)]
*  black Friday games. They're just games all the time. Uh, the bundle, we asked you your five favorite [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=182.39999999999998s)]
*  NFL futures right now, four weeks away. We're going to go in descending order [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=188.8s)]
*  from five to one to try to build the drama up really for house. And then house is going to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=194.16s)]
*  try to pretend he's listening while he's also, uh, kind of writing these down on some stealth [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=198.64s)]
*  notebooks. So it's not stealth. It's right here. I'm ready. There you go. Uh, your, your five [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=203.04s)]
*  favorites, number five, let's hear it. Yeah, let's go with the, uh, Tennessee Titans under six and a [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=208.16s)]
*  half wins minus one 22 at Fandel. Most people don't realize that we'll, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=213.6s)]
*  Levus had a lower success rate than Kenny Pickett did last year. And I think it's kind of flown [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=218.0s)]
*  under the radar because he had some really impressive highlight plays. And if you just [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=222.0s)]
*  watch the red zone channel, you probably saw a ton of like crazy throws and him taking on linebackers, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=225.6s)]
*  but the offense basically relied on him throwing the ball down the field, hitting a couple of big [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=231.6s)]
*  plays a game to kind of stay in it. And then Bray, we'll would coach up the defense and they would [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  be really successful there. I don't really get the sense that the variable departure [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=240.96s)]
*  was necessarily an on the field football decision and just like a strategic difference vision with [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=246.0s)]
*  the general manager and the front office there. And the most alarming thing about Levus. And I [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=250.56s)]
*  think if Joe house, what Sam Howell all last year, he would know this, his sack rates were alarming [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  in college and in the pros and only the giants had a worse sack rate than Tennessee last year. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=260.56s)]
*  They really haven't improved the offensive line a ton. It's still going to be one of the bottom [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=265.92s)]
*  five or six offensive lines. They use the top seven pick on a left tackle and it's still not [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=270.56s)]
*  that good of an offensive line, right? Exactly. At PFF, right? The one to 32, they had them in [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=276.0s)]
*  the bottom five. And I just wonder, you know, they bring in an offensive coach. We didn't really know [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=281.12s)]
*  a ton about Brian Callahan. He's never really called plays. So I think there's a lot of questions [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=286.72s)]
*  about how much better the offense is. And I think there's questions. Could the defense get worse? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=290.48s)]
*  They were one of the best defenses in the red zone last year. That's tends to be kind of noisy [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=295.2s)]
*  year to year. So a lot of questions about Tennessee. I do think all three teams in the division [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=299.2s)]
*  are better than they were last year. And I don't really see Tennessee taking that step forward. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  Again, that's the sack number is the one I can't get past with Will Levis. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=308.08s)]
*  Well, I know I could just see the light in house's eyes. What's your immediate, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=312.48s)]
*  I have two reactions, but what's your immediate reaction? I mean, I've literally bet this every [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  which way I have Levis under yards, Levis under touchdowns, Pollard under yards, Pollard under [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=321.12s)]
*  touchdowns, Titans disaster area. This defense, especially the bundos last point at that past [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=328.8s)]
*  defense was supposed to be like a pass funnel kind of situation. It was a pass fire hose. It was a [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=336.24s)]
*  disaster in any franchise that thinks that it can make progress without Mike Frabel as part of it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=343.04s)]
*  The decision making gives you significant pause. So I'm on this under, I played it every which way. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=349.44s)]
*  I'm thrilled to have this welcome aboard AD. Welcome. Yeah, that was a good first one. So I [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=357.28s)]
*  have three reactions. One, if you're going, who is the worst team in the AFC? Because we know we're [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=362.64s)]
*  going to have two or three terrible teams. Tennessee is in the conversation. New England [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=367.76s)]
*  is in the conversation. And for me, Vegas over Denver for the third spot, not sure how you guys [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=373.2s)]
*  feel on that, but like at gunpoint, I just, I really don't like Vegas. They seemed super top [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=380.0s)]
*  heavy to me. I'm not sold on Pierce at all. I don't love their schedule. Like I just, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=386.8s)]
*  so those would be the three. So that's one. Two, if Levis didn't have that comeback against the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=392.08s)]
*  dolphins on Monday night that killed all of our parlays, wouldn't we be way more suspicious of [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=397.44s)]
*  the Levis thing? Cause he had this really fun fourth quarter that all of us watched. We're like, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=402.88s)]
*  Oh, Levis. But for the most part that like, as the bundle said, it was flashes flashes in the pan. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=407.68s)]
*  And a lot of times the pan had like that sticky shit in the bottom of it that you have to like [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=414.64s)]
*  use. What's that thing that the hard thing you have to scrape off sets too. And then third, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=418.64s)]
*  this is the most glaring one to be the new coach theory, which we love. And there's a lot of good [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=425.52s)]
*  candidates this year for who's going to be the new coach bump team. Right. And I'm sure I think we [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=429.68s)]
*  have more candidates this year than we've had before. Could be houses team could be the chargers [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=435.59999999999997s)]
*  going from Staley to Harbaugh. It could be Reheme Morris in Atlanta, Reheme Morris, second chance. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=441.03999999999996s)]
*  Tennessee is the opposite to me. I love variable. I felt like they overachieved with variable every [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=447.03999999999996s)]
*  year and I don't know why they would be better without variable. So if you had to rank those [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=452.4s)]
*  three, Levis overexposure to a couple of good moments. Um, the fact that somebody in the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=457.44s)]
*  AFC has to be bad or the new coach theory in reverse. What was the number one thing driving [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=463.52s)]
*  that one for you? I think the new coach thing in reverse, I've had a variables cost me a lot [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=469.28s)]
*  of money because as a numbers person, they never really made sense. And they just always, he's kind [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=474.0s)]
*  of got the Tomlin ask nature to him where you're not quite sure how it works. You're like, he's too [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=478.79999999999995s)]
*  conservative. But then all of a sudden every game is 16 16 with three minutes to go. And they find [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=483.2s)]
*  a way to, to grind a couple out and you just don't know what you're going to get, you know, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=487.91999999999996s)]
*  change isn't always good. And I think that Tennessee, when you look at how bad their [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=492.71999999999997s)]
*  defense fell off last year in the second half, and then you combine that with losing variable, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=496.8s)]
*  I don't really see the case for them being any better. And you kind of clawed their way to six [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=502.0s)]
*  wins last year. Yeah. House, if, if the jets had just fired solid and hired variable and may, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=507.68s)]
*  they just said, fuck it. We have a chance to win the super bowl. Would you have a jet super bowl [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=514.4s)]
*  ticket right now? A hundred percent, because I'll confess right now, I do have some exposure to the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=518.32s)]
*  jet. I mean, you bet on, you bet on fucking France. Of course you did. You're always roped into the [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=524.8000000000001s)]
*  narrative. I mean, I, I, I think they're pretty good on both sides of the ball. But if they had [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=529.6800000000001s)]
*  variable, good God, that, I mean, the ticket would have been pricey. You probably wouldn't have done [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=535.12s)]
*  better than it would have been nine to one or eight to one because all the crazy New Yorkers [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=539.44s)]
*  would have snapped it up. The bundle. What's the juice on that Titans line? Minus one 22. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=542.88s)]
*  And that's a great price. Yeah, that feels so they would have to go. It was actually, it was the first [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=549.68s)]
*  bet I made the season when I started doing work. So they would have to go seven and 10 to beat that. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=553.68s)]
*  Yep. I don't, I don't see that. I don't really see a scenario for it at all. That division, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=560.08s)]
*  we, we did some of our division previews already. I mean, that, that division is kind of quietly [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=568.16s)]
*  loaded. Like it wouldn't shock me if we got three 10 game winners. Now I'm not predicting that, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=575.4399999999999s)]
*  but it wouldn't floor me because I think Indianapolis is right there. And I'd be floored by, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=582.64s)]
*  I gotta say, I'd be floored by Jacksonville. I don't know. I don't know. Jacksonville, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=588.4s)]
*  Jacksonville is the post type. Everybody's in on Jacksonville after being out on them. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=592.88s)]
*  I don't see the Jacksonville thing. Good luck betting on Trevor Lawrence. All right. What's [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=596.64s)]
*  your number four? All right. We're going to go with another under, we're going to go to your, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=600.16s)]
*  your favorite division, house's favorite division, the NFC South Tampa Bay bucks under seven and a [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=604.08s)]
*  half wins plus one 22. So Baker Mayfield has this resurgence season out of nowhere. And going into [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=609.4399999999999s)]
*  last season, the narrative was, all right, Tom Brady retires, the bucks rosters falling apart. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=616.0s)]
*  They're going to have a kind of a tank rebuild season. And then out of nowhere, they're hosting [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=621.28s)]
*  a playoff game and they win a playoff game and come within one drive of going to the NFC [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=625.28s)]
*  championship because Baker just goes and has this incredible season, gets Dave Canales, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=630.0s)]
*  a head coaching job. All of these things go right for Tampa. 430 Dave, let's send practice at 430. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=634.56s)]
*  We've got to spend time with our family. Love that. Love work life balance. Love that. But, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=640.48s)]
*  and I'm actually interested in Carolina. Maybe Bryce Young might be a bridge too far. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=645.92s)]
*  Calm down, DeBundo. If you want to get a little crazy, they're interesting. This is your first [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=650.48s)]
*  appearance in the park. Calm down. Take a breath. So Nick Giffin, my old colleague at the Action [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=654.4s)]
*  Network, he has a metric called luck rankings, which essentially looks at play to play. How [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=660.0s)]
*  good are you? And then compares it to the final record. And last season, number one luck ranking [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=664.64s)]
*  team was Pittsburgh, which should surprise nobody. Number two was Philly. They were number one until [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=670.9599999999999s)]
*  their collapse. And number three was Tampa Bay. They ran really good in terms of red zone defense. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=675.6s)]
*  They were one of the luckiest teams in the NFL. And you can just see how this doesn't quite work [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=681.12s)]
*  trying to run it back. And maybe when we look back on last season, we'll say, hey, maybe Tampa [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=685.76s)]
*  would have been better off if they hadn't had so much success. Cause now I think they're perfectly [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=690.88s)]
*  a purgatory team. It's like the Giants a year ago, right? It's like that nine, seven and one in a [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=695.2s)]
*  playoff. And all of a sudden you get fooled into thinking you might be good. That's actually a [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=699.84s)]
*  perfect comp for what this is. Everybody thinks Baker Mayfield is better than he really is. It's [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=703.84s)]
*  similar to what Daniel Jones and it's different because I think Jones is a little bit younger [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=707.84s)]
*  than Mayfield and we haven't seen as much from him. But again, they lose Carlton Davis from their [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=714.0s)]
*  secondary. They hire Liam Cohen from the McVay tree to be the offensive coordinator. Big loss in [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=719.44s)]
*  terms of play calling duties and how that will work. Don't know how Baker responds in another [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=725.84s)]
*  year in this system. So I'm going with the bucks under. I think it's a pretty bad division. And I [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=730.4s)]
*  think unfortunately you can't bet against all three teams. It's kind of hard to do that because [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=734.88s)]
*  they're all correlated against each other. But I think Tampa is the most overvalued of those top [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=739.12s)]
*  three NFC South contenders. House, what are your feelings on the Bundle Philadelphia guy, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=743.52s)]
*  Syracuse guy, just pre pre-determined to just be kind of glass half empty, starting off the [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=751.52s)]
*  pod with two unders. Not surprised. I gotta say I'm not surprised. No, he comes by it. Honestly, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=757.84s)]
*  he's an analytics dude. He does math. He likes the math. So unders always have a positive expected [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=762.88s)]
*  value plus EV. Isn't that how they say it out there? A.D. Come on, Bundle. The nerds, the nerds. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=770.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know, she'll she'll Kapadi is trying to make Tony Buns happen. I don't, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=778.8s)]
*  I don't think it's going to stick. We've been doing Tony, but we've been doing some [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=782.96s)]
*  Philly special podcasts. That's that. I don't, I don't hate that. All right. So here's, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=785.4399999999999s)]
*  here's my counter on this Tampa pick, which I do like. It looks too easy. That's one [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=790.32s)]
*  NFC South. Like, is it just a hornet's nest? You just stay away. Is the, is the entire division [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=799.44s)]
*  just to stay away? I don't feel you can kind of look at every team and go, ah, or you go, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=806.6400000000001s)]
*  and I don't feel good about any of the four. And I think anybody who's looking at that division [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=814.6400000000001s)]
*  and going, I know exactly what's going to happen is fucking kidding themselves. That would be my [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=819.36s)]
*  counter. So like, is there, you don't have to tip it off now, but are there other teams you like, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=825.6s)]
*  or do you feel like that's just all four of those teams are either unders or stay aways? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=830.4s)]
*  Well, that's why I think Carolina, if they can get anything out of Bryce Young, if, if, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=836.72s)]
*  if he plays anywhere close to his draft pedigree and isn't a total bust, they're going to be [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=840.08s)]
*  in the mix potentially just because of how bad everyone is. I mean, essentially the Falcons and [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=845.36s)]
*  the Saints have flipped where last year Saints win total was nine and a half. Everybody was like, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=849.76s)]
*  Oh, the Saints aren't really that good, but they're definitely better than everybody else. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=854.64s)]
*  And their schedule is really easy. Look at how many, look at how many games they're favored in, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=858.24s)]
*  but they actually aren't a good football team. And now they flipped with the Falcons. And so I [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=862.64s)]
*  would argue that, you know, maybe if you had to pick one of those three, I would, I would go with [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=866.88s)]
*  New Orleans. Their offense was quietly good at the end of the season last year. And the luck [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=870.08s)]
*  rankings that I mentioned earlier, they were dead last. So all of a sudden you're like, wait, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=874.48s)]
*  maybe the Saints are have something, but the Saints are in a similar position to Tampa where [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=878.32s)]
*  they're in purgatory. They keep running it back. And I don't really want to put my money behind [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=882.88s)]
*  their car to overachieve the market because that seems like a disaster that could implode at any [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=887.5200000000001s)]
*  moment. So I think that's why this division is fun. There's a stat I'm going to mention later [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=893.0400000000001s)]
*  about teams going worst to first happens almost every year. I'm not trying to, again, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=899.36s)]
*  I'm trying to cool my jets here, but Carolina is super interesting to me. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=905.36s)]
*  House, if I gave you two tickets and one of them was the Saints to win the NFC South [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=909.52s)]
*  and the other one was a special off the menu fan, dual parlay bet of Dennis Allen will not be the [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=915.44s)]
*  Saints coach in week 10 and Derek Carr will not be their starting quarterback in week 10. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=921.92s)]
*  Which ticket would you take from me? I don't understand. That's the all time [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=926.4s)]
*  no brainer. There's no challenge there. I fucking hate the Saints. They are a forever never bet [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=932.16s)]
*  under any circumstances. Dennis Allen, we've had this so many times right in our face and I'm not [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=939.8399999999999s)]
*  doing it ever again. I hate this Tampa play by the Bundo because what it requires is you have to [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=947.68s)]
*  make a commitment to Atlanta and everybody's on Atlanta and Atlanta is the sexy story and I hate [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=955.52s)]
*  that. So the way that I ended up playing this dumb division was the Atlanta to win the South, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=962.0s)]
*  the NFC South at like minus 120 because it's the only price that I could buy. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=971.4399999999999s)]
*  Stay away from wins completely. Yeah. No way. You're not messing with that. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=975.52s)]
*  There's a Raheem Morris case for them just that maybe there's a level of coaching competency that [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=980.0s)]
*  they just didn't have last year. I hate taking a team that's just got nothing from a top eight pick. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=986.24s)]
*  Penix isn't going to play. There's this asset that you could put a starting left tackle in there. You [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=991.68s)]
*  could put a elite corner. A pass rusher. You could put a dunze in there. They have no pass rush. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=997.12s)]
*  Even the guy that Seahawks took 16th, that guy would have been awesome for them and they just [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1003.76s)]
*  whiff on the pick for at least this season. So that makes me nervous. I like the instinct to [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1008.72s)]
*  go under with Tampa though because they really do remind me of the Giants last year. I think [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1014.08s)]
*  modern medicine is great now, but Kirk Cousins tore his Achilles in October. I mean it is a quick [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1019.52s)]
*  turnaround. It used to be a year. Now it's like 10 months. Aaron Rodgers said it was like three [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1024.72s)]
*  months and he's really old. I don't want to- New coordinator, new coach, new scheme, coming off [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1029.52s)]
*  a major injury and expectations. There's plenty to be skeptical of. I really don't want to prolong [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1036.88s)]
*  the agony and make us talk about Carolina any further, but I do want to ask AD, how can you [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1043.0400000000002s)]
*  have any confidence in that defense? Because it's one thing for them to lose burns, but [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1051.44s)]
*  Frankie Louvoo is a whole nother ball away. Yeah, he's on your team now. That's right. That's the [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1056.96s)]
*  reason that we have good vibes up here in the DMV. That defense I think took a huge- They're [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1062.1599999999999s)]
*  putting a lot of pressure on J.C. Horn who can't stay on the football field. That's right. Exactly. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1068.24s)]
*  So talk me into the defense. I'm listening. It's August. Let's try and make some money now. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1074.0s)]
*  I'm not listening. I might go to the bathroom. Yeah, it was one of the worst run defenses [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1079.4399999999998s)]
*  in the NFL and they haven't really improved against the pass here. So I'm not saying they're [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1083.12s)]
*  going to be a great team, but again, this is more of a factor of the circumstance and the fact that [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1088.0s)]
*  I do like Everoe, the defensive coordinator. He was getting a lot of head coaching buzz, even though [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1093.2s)]
*  he was on one of the worst teams, coaching one of the worst teams, which I think says a lot about [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1097.36s)]
*  him. If teams were able to see through the fact that they were an absolute disaster, especially [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1102.24s)]
*  against the run, they were like a league average pass defense though last year. So it's not the end [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1106.24s)]
*  of the world, I think. But in this division where the ceiling is so low, if Bryce Young, maybe [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1112.48s)]
*  Canales can work some magic into him, I don't think he'll ever be able to achieve the athletic [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1119.28s)]
*  limitations. The ceiling that we think is possible for Bryce Young, I think is pretty out the window [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1123.84s)]
*  after what we saw athletically last year and how bad he was. It's very unlikely he goes from [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1129.1200000000001s)]
*  terrible to great, but I think it could go from terrible to average. And I'm not sure that average [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1134.08s)]
*  is not the best quarterback in this division come December. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1140.24s)]
*  Right. Well, so if you're making the case, it's a little like when, if you're making the glass [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1143.92s)]
*  half full case for Houston a year ago, we're like, well, weird division. What if this happened and [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1148.3200000000002s)]
*  this happened and this happened and what if the coach is awesome? And what if Stroud is way better [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1154.16s)]
*  than you think? And you list like seven things and then for Houston, all of them hit. For Carolina, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1158.64s)]
*  the coaching situation was, I think, probably the worst in the league last year. House's guy [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1165.44s)]
*  Frank Reich. How's that? An immortal quote from last August, Ringer gambling show and House called [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1170.0s)]
*  Frank Reich the best coach in the NFC South, which we've made fun of him for a year. But then [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1176.48s)]
*  you think like the worst skill position guys in either conference and going down the line, it was [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1181.6s)]
*  not a good offensive line. It was the worst pot. And then Stroud's doing well. Every single thing [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1187.04s)]
*  was bad for Bryce Young. So I see the case, but the case to me is more this division so bad, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1191.36s)]
*  somebody's got to win. And this is Raheem's been making this point on Ringer gambling. Like, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1197.76s)]
*  why not at 11 to one? Like, why not? On the other hand, I would probably book that bet. We have three [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1202.64s)]
*  left, five favorites, Anthony DeBundo, NFL futures. What is number three? All right, let's take a more [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1207.12s)]
*  positive spin now. We're going to go a team I like this year, Seattle Seahawks. It's a twofer plus [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1213.36s)]
*  175 to make the playoffs seven to one to win the division. You're starting to see some cracks in [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1219.36s)]
*  San Francisco, the IU stuff happening. McCaffrey just picked up a calf injury. It's easy to forget [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1225.12s)]
*  that San Francisco every year was, can they stay healthy? They had all these injury issues. Well, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1230.56s)]
*  guess what? The whole team just about stayed healthy last year. And it was probably, you know, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1234.8799999999999s)]
*  a 95th percentile San Francisco outcome outside of a couple of games in the middle of the season [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1239.52s)]
*  where they had that blip and Purdy looked a little lost. I think he was concussed. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1244.4799999999998s)]
*  Now they're one of the oldest teams in the NFL last year. They pretty much run it back offensively, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1249.28s)]
*  potentially without IU, who some who watch film and no more ball than I do say was their most [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1254.32s)]
*  valuable offensive player outside of McCaffrey. So I think there's some real threat for them to [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1259.6s)]
*  take a step back, especially with the shoot ball hangover and getting so close and not quite, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1264.8799999999999s)]
*  you know, getting to the apex like they did last year. And Jim Harbaugh is getting all of the [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1270.0s)]
*  credit and all of the clout because of his track record. But I actually think the team that has the [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1274.8799999999999s)]
*  chance to make a real step forward is Mike McDonald and the Seahawks. And he basically [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1280.0s)]
*  had the entire Baltimore defense last year put in career years, elevates talent across the board. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1285.04s)]
*  Nobody was saying, wow, look at how talented Baltimore is defensively until last year. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1290.56s)]
*  And everybody was looking across the board like, whoa, they got this production from [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1295.36s)]
*  Jadevion Clowney and Roquan Smith's a great player, but Patrick Queen, like, we're not sure about him. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1298.8s)]
*  Some secondary stuff too that people weren't expecting. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1303.52s)]
*  Exactly. Made it work with pretty inconsistent corner play because of injuries. Like they [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1306.8s)]
*  schemed their way into the best defense in the NFL. And what I like about McDonald is that he [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1311.84s)]
*  doesn't come across as his background is in finance and management. It's not like your [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1317.84s)]
*  traditional football guy, so to speak. And he's very young. And I think he's going to get buy in [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1323.76s)]
*  from this locker room who just felt like Pete Carroll had kind of run its course. The defense [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1328.6399999999999s)]
*  was antiquated. They bottomed out so badly last year defensively to the point where they were at [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1334.4s)]
*  1.30th, 31st in defensive metrics. And if you just fix the defense to make it league average, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1339.68s)]
*  and they've made some improvements there, especially against the run where they were [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1346.3200000000002s)]
*  really bad last year. I think that combined with the fact that they still have a ton of weapons on [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1350.24s)]
*  offense could get them to be the kind of sleeper post type team because two years ago, they were [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1356.0s)]
*  projected to be one of the worst teams. Gino has this Renaissance year out of nowhere. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1362.96s)]
*  Everybody buys the Seahawks. They kind of take a step back. Now they're the post type [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1367.1200000000001s)]
*  in the point where people are kind of overlooking them. A lot of people are taking LA. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1371.8400000000001s)]
*  I think LA has got a lot of cracks. I think Seattle is the team that's going to make a run [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1376.32s)]
*  of this division. So over is still seven and a half or did that go up? Seven and a half is [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1379.52s)]
*  juiced. Yeah. Which use divisions in the plus seven 50 range. I'm with you. I mean, I think [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1384.96s)]
*  you undersold the McCaffrey injury because I was listening to our fantasy football pod yesterday [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1391.92s)]
*  and they were like trying to figure out where to rank McCaffrey in the running back rankings. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1399.6000000000001s)]
*  It's the classic, what do you do? How much does he go for? It's clear he's going to be compromised [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1403.76s)]
*  the first month. House, ironically, the first month was what I had pegged for the easy part of [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1409.1200000000001s)]
*  the Niner schedule. Their home jets at Minnesota, at the Rams, home Pats, home Arizona. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1414.88s)]
*  I was like, that's got to be probably four and one, but now no McCaffrey and the schedule gets [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1421.92s)]
*  harder as the year goes along. Trent Williams, I don't know if he's even back yet from the holdout, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1426.88s)]
*  so we don't know what kind of shape he's going to be in. Debo, I'm never going to bet on him [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1432.16s)]
*  playing 17 games. Purdy's playing for a new contract. Iuke, the situation's kind of nuts. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1436.48s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't be shocked. What do you think of the Seattle Pickhouse? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1444.16s)]
*  So I love when I'm in the spot of being in violent agreement with Dabbs because when we first met [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1447.68s)]
*  each other, I confessed to him that I would read his column voraciously every week as it came out [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1456.96s)]
*  on the Action Network. It influenced my thinking. I tried to give credit where credit was due, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1463.8400000000001s)]
*  but now I can just tell him, bro, I'm stealing your stuff because I love it. But I already- [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1468.72s)]
*  How's Drake just stealing verses from rappers on the internet claiming he hadn't heard of them? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1474.64s)]
*  No, I gave shout outs. I tried my best. Everybody knows how old I am. But here's the thing with [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1480.72s)]
*  Seattle. I think that they won nine games and still underperformed. I think the talent really [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1488.0s)]
*  on both sides of the ball is the compelling thing to me. The price is right for the division play. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1493.76s)]
*  I don't think that we have to really talk down San Francisco. We can just kind of talk up what [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1502.72s)]
*  Seattle has. Why is Seattle two wins worse? They lucked out with Byron Murphy falling to 16. It [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1508.64s)]
*  was exactly what they needed. JSN's in year two. Let's be honest. Pete Carroll and Bill Belichick [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1514.56s)]
*  were in their 70s and there were signs of real slippage and strategic weird shit going on. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1523.1200000000001s)]
*  Now you bring these new voices, new coaches. I thought McDonald was great last year. To me, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1530.96s)]
*  he's the odds on favor for the new coach theory. There's a lot more talent in the room than what [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1535.84s)]
*  the Chargers have with LA and at Harle. I totally agree. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1543.1200000000001s)]
*  Basically, it's like, can they take the Rams spot? [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1546.88s)]
*  Unless you think there's three playoff teams from this division, which by the way, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1550.48s)]
*  isn't inconceivable. They grabbed that offensive coordinator from Washington, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1554.08s)]
*  a dude that loves to throw the ball down the field. One of Geno Smith's strengths happens [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1559.52s)]
*  to be throwing the ball down the field 20 yards or longer. He's in the top 10 of the league at that. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1566.8s)]
*  Let's start using these weapons that the Seahawks possess. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1571.28s)]
*  They were a top five offense early downs. If you just go first and second down, they were [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1575.52s)]
*  right up there with San Francisco, with Green Bay, with Dallas, some of the best offenses in the [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1580.16s)]
*  league. It was third downs and their offensive line that really cost them offensively. The key [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1584.96s)]
*  for them are the tackles. Great rookie year, took a step back last year, had injuries. The O line [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1591.68s)]
*  is definitely their weakness. They're a bottom five or six unit by most metrics. If the tackles [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1597.2s)]
*  go back to what they were as rookies, then it's more of your average team and you can get away [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1603.2s)]
*  with that. I have multiple texts to Seahawks fan Danny Kelly of The Ringer. I started my prep [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1607.04s)]
*  three, four weeks ago and this was one of the overs that I thought was pulsating. I was like, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1613.12s)]
*  why is this seven and a half? Why would they be two wins worse? I could understand eight and a half, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1618.08s)]
*  but seven and a half. I haven't made all my official picks yet. I'm waiting for the extravaganza [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1622.7199999999998s)]
*  with Sal. Seattle was one of the ones I circled. The question for me is, could this division produce [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1627.6799999999998s)]
*  three playoff teams or not? Because I think Green Bay and Detroit both make it. One AFC South team [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1635.04s)]
*  so then the other question would be, does one of these teams take Dallas's spot? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1643.1999999999998s)]
*  I think from a talent standpoint, if you compare Dallas to Seattle and the Rams, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1648.8s)]
*  I don't think Dallas has more talent than either of those teams. They might be in the vicinity, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1655.36s)]
*  but I wouldn't say they're more talented. We'll see. I like that Seattle pick. All right. I can't [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1659.12s)]
*  believe I really liked the first three. I can't even what you have in store for the final two. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1664.8s)]
*  I can't wait. We're going to stay positive for the last two. Cincinnati Bengals to win the AFC [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1669.52s)]
*  North plus 165. Going along with the Mike McDonald discussion is that Mike McDonald left Baltimore. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1675.76s)]
*  I have concerns about whether Baltimore, we're buying really high on them. At this point last [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1686.08s)]
*  year, the Ravens were three to one to win their division. The questions were Lamar, can he stay [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1691.52s)]
*  healthy? Can he stay healthy? No. The answer prior to last year was no. Now he has the MVP season [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1696.48s)]
*  and now everybody wants to drink the Lamar Kool-Aid and get excited about how good Lamar Jackson is. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1702.4s)]
*  Rightfully so. When he plays, they're a very good team. Skinny Lamar. The defense has some concerns. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1710.0s)]
*  Exactly. His immune system is very weird. He's sick more than any professional athlete I've ever [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1718.48s)]
*  seen. Interesting. Offensively, second year under Munkin. I think teams will be able to adjust to [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1723.28s)]
*  them a little bit offensively in what they were doing. The skill positions aren't really still [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1729.92s)]
*  that great. So outside of Zay Flowers, we have the oft injured Mark Andrews and then some real [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1735.04s)]
*  questions along the offensive line and the skill positions. I think there's some real questions. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1740.56s)]
*  Look, if their plan is to just run Derek Henry into the line 30 times a game, I'm willing to take [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1745.04s)]
*  my chance that that will not be great at this point in his career. I keep counting out Derek [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1750.64s)]
*  Henry and he keeps proving me wrong. So maybe I'll look like an idiot in a month or two. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1754.64s)]
*  But the biggest thing for me here, the Bengals have a last place schedule and it plays a huge [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1758.96s)]
*  role in the differences in the matchups because the Ravens and Bengals will play 14 games that [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1765.3600000000001s)]
*  are exactly the same, including the two against each other. The difference is that Baltimore will [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1771.5200000000002s)]
*  play Buffalo, Houston and Tampa. Cincinnati gets to play New England, Tennessee and Carolina. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1775.92s)]
*  That's like a two win gap in terms of win probability, wins across the season. I'm not [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1782.0s)]
*  sure that the Bengals are any worse than the Ravens as currently constructed. Cincinnati improved [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1786.96s)]
*  their defense, which was a problem last year in the secondary. Just this time last year, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1792.4s)]
*  everybody was saying Lou Anarumo is the best defensive coordinator in the league and now [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1797.68s)]
*  people have forgotten about him. I'm back in on Cincinnati. Hopefully, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1801.28s)]
*  Borough State is healthy. I hope they win the North. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1804.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting. I didn't even realize this as it was happening, but last year the NFC had [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1806.08s)]
*  the nine road games because they moved to the 17 game schedule and this year it's the AFC. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1811.6s)]
*  So when you look at those nine road games, some of them, some of the nine road games later, like, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1816.0s)]
*  that looks brutal. They have the opposite. I mean, they obviously have Kansas City, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1823.52s)]
*  but they're on the road against Carolina, against the Giants in week 11. They're at the Chargers, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1828.08s)]
*  which is basically a home game because the Chargers don't have fans. They're at Dallas in [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1833.84s)]
*  week 14, which normally is terrifying, but I don't know if Dallas is going to be good this year [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1838.3999999999999s)]
*  at Tennessee and then at Pittsburgh in the last week, but it's not as intimidating. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1842.8s)]
*  I guess the question for me with the Bengals, the first is the Borough piece. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1847.1999999999998s)]
*  House, what do your little birdies say about Borough? They were talking about, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1855.76s)]
*  this is a wrist injury that no professional athlete has gotten before. Some of the crazy [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1860.72s)]
*  wrist, no, no, it's going to be fine. But there's been a lot of conjecture and talk and rumors about [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1866.48s)]
*  it and it just scares me. What do you think, House? Yeah. And some of that thought sharing was [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1872.32s)]
*  occurring on the grounds at a Bengals camp and folks I think are highly attuned to watching [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1879.3600000000001s)]
*  Joe Borough get comfortable in the role that it seems like the Bengals want to put him in, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1887.76s)]
*  which is under center to protect him a bit more. But yes, this wrist injury by some indication is [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1895.44s)]
*  a one of one. I'm not touching the Bengals at all because of how crucial Borough is. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1903.76s)]
*  I think this is a stay away from me too. Yeah. I kind of want to see it. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1908.56s)]
*  Exactly. That's my view. Because the thing is they're definitely worse [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1913.28s)]
*  at running back, definitely worse at defensive back and they lost DJ Reader who I thought was [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1916.88s)]
*  important for them. Right. So if you're going to tell me Borough is awesome this year, like I, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1922.48s)]
*  he's one of my favorite football players. Like I'm not betting against him. We've, we've, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1927.7600000000002s)]
*  we've lost money to him. We've won a lot of money on him and they went nine and eight last year and [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1931.44s)]
*  he was basically messed up most of the year. Dabunda, what do you think about this? Is it, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1936.64s)]
*  is it okay if I wait until after week two at Kansas City? They play the Pats week one, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1942.8s)]
*  they're going to win that. If they lose that Pats game, then all the money you would have put on [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1947.9199999999998s)]
*  the Bengals anyway, you're like, Oh my God, this is the worst bet I've ever made. And at Kansas City, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1954.48s)]
*  get a feel for what that looks like. They're probably going to lose and then kind of wait [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1959.52s)]
*  in after week two. Have you ever done the wait and see with the future or no? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1964.24s)]
*  I think it depends on what the schedule looks like. The scary thing here is like Kansas City is [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1967.9199999999998s)]
*  the kind of team that can be got early in the season. And so if you do wait and they win that [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1972.32s)]
*  game, all of a sudden you're cooked. Right. So, and you look at their schedule. Now the Bengals [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1977.12s)]
*  have been slow starters just about every year with Borough, but New England at Kansas City, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1982.0s)]
*  Washington home at Carolina. That's the first four weeks. You're not going to get a much [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1986.32s)]
*  friendlier start. Then they play New York in week six. So after Baltimore at home in week five, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1991.6s)]
*  like it's a pretty friendly first half. And, you know, it just gets at the point. Like if you go [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=1995.76s)]
*  compare that to what Baltimore has to run through in terms of rest disadvantages too, with Baltimore [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2000.08s)]
*  at the end of the season, their schedule gets really tough where they're playing. They have [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2004.3999999999999s)]
*  the Wednesday Christmas game after the Saturday war with Pittsburgh. That's unbelievable that they [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2008.1599999999999s)]
*  did that. It jumps out. Like it's, I just can't believe that they think that way with the football [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2012.6399999999999s)]
*  schedule. Like that's a good idea to do that. They're taking Christmas. They're stealing it [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2018.32s)]
*  from the NBA. Crazy. The other case that I don't think can be understated is [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2022.8s)]
*  Deshawn a full year in Cleveland, a team that had good vibes last year down the stretch with [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2030.1599999999999s)]
*  feel good Joe Flacco and Deshawn it's already like just, just feels not awesome. And what if they [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2036.08s)]
*  just stink and then Pittsburgh with this weird Wilson Fields thing that they feel like they [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2043.52s)]
*  haven't totally navigated yet. So it does feel like this division is a little weaker than it [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2048.32s)]
*  did. I'm a little higher on Baltimore's weapons than you, cause the, the other tight end on the [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2053.1200000000003s)]
*  Ravens, I think everybody's been going nuts about, and I do kind of, kind of like the Derek Henry. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2058.48s)]
*  Like maybe they can get one awesome year out of them. Where do you stand on the Derek Henry [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2063.92s)]
*  awesome for one year house in Baltimore? No, I'm not sold. Yeah, I'm Luke warm. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2068.48s)]
*  Um, I think their offensive line doesn't, you know, uh, instill a ton of confidence, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2074.64s)]
*  but this division is impossible to handicap because my instinct is to do what dabs did there, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2080.64s)]
*  which is to fade Baltimore. And this schedule thing is compelling. Like the Bengals absolutely [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2086.3199999999997s)]
*  by far have the easiest run of it in, in the division. Uh, but the problem is you have to [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2092.8799999999997s)]
*  talk yourself into Cleveland and you just, um, laid out the case for why that might be a bit [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2098.48s)]
*  of a challenge. I'm not gonna, with Nick Chubb coming back off of catastrophic knee injury [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2103.7599999999998s)]
*  and Deshaun Watson with a frown on his face. No, thank you. All right. It's time. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2108.08s)]
*  So I've agreed on three. I, to me, since he's a stay away, but I could also see myself on like [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2114.0s)]
*  September 3rd when I just want to, I've, by the way, I didn't, I didn't tell you guys, I haven't [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2119.12s)]
*  talked about this on the pod. I intentionally have not bet on a single NFL future yet because I look [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2123.36s)]
*  back on my future bets last year and there was just carnage from June and July before I really [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2129.36s)]
*  had a handle on that where I just jumped. I was like the giants, why is that so low and just betting [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2136.48s)]
*  overs and stupid shit. I had the giants, Pat's overs. I had, I was just embarrassing and I salvaged [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2141.04s)]
*  a lot of it in late August, early September. So this year I put an artificial deadline of August [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2148.48s)]
*  25th. I'm just not allowed to bet NFL futures until August 25th. And that's what I'm gonna do. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2153.92s)]
*  Okay. Here we go. Number one, Anthony DeBundo, his favorite NFL future of the 2024 season. Let's [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2160.08s)]
*  hear it. Uh-oh. All right. So I bought this. He brought props. I brought, I bought this in a week [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2167.76s)]
*  eight or nine of last year and just decided to become a huge Jordan Love fan. Liked him in [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2175.36s)]
*  college, kind of forgot about him for a few years. Remembered that he was on the Packers going into [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2181.12s)]
*  last season and I was sitting there watching a couple of games and his receivers were letting [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2185.44s)]
*  him down and they were just a little bit off and they were so close to winning some games. And I'm [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2189.7599999999998s)]
*  like, this team feels like they're going to turn the corner. And in the second half of the season, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2193.92s)]
*  he was one of the three best quarterbacks in the NFL by the efficiency and the comparison [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2198.96s)]
*  metrics and the accuracy metrics, EPA and CPOE that we look at. He won house and I money in the [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2203.6s)]
*  playoffs. We love, we love Jordan Love. We love anyone that wins us money. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2208.56s)]
*  And down the stretch, they were a really, you know, a big cash cow. They had some big wins, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2214.08s)]
*  the Thanksgiving day win in Detroit. They had the upset of the chiefs. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2218.96s)]
*  And then you saw the holes in the second half too, which were, and one of the most [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2223.04s)]
*  impressively bad defensive stretches you will ever see in three consecutive weeks, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2228.32s)]
*  they got diced up by Tommy DeVito, Baker Mayfield. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2233.2s)]
*  It was so horrible. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2237.12s)]
*  And Bryce Young, who had the best game of his career against Green Bay in this Joe Barry defense. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2239.52s)]
*  Well, Joe Barry's gone. Thank goodness. They bring in Jeff Halfley, who had been a coordinator at the [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2245.2799999999997s)]
*  college level and had been a defensive backs coach, somebody I thought was really going to turn around [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2251.12s)]
*  Boston college, but harder, harder to do that than just one coach. It's a structural issue in Boston [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2255.2799999999997s)]
*  college and playing in the ACC, whatever. But Halfley leaves BC, a head coaching job in college [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2261.12s)]
*  to take an NFL defensive coordinator job. And I think it's a great hire. I think Halfley is a good [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2267.7599999999998s)]
*  defensive mind. And you combine that with how young this offense is. And we know that LaFleur is an [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2271.92s)]
*  excellent offensive coach at using different formations and different schemes to maximize [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2278.72s)]
*  the talent. There's no obvious number one guy, but they have so many guys who could become that. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2285.2799999999997s)]
*  I think this offense is really exciting. Now the offensive line does have some shuffling to take [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2291.2799999999997s)]
*  care of, but in terms of offensive line, offensive coordinator, and then just improving by getting [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2295.2799999999997s)]
*  rid of Joe Barry, the only thing that scares me is the kicking game. And there's Carlson appears to [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2301.2s)]
*  be the favorite to win the job. And he was horrible last year, but Green Bay two to one to win the [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2307.44s)]
*  NFC North last year. One of the most heartbreaking losses of my life was Lions to win the NFC 12 to [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2312.72s)]
*  one. It was my first bet last year in like May, and I was already cashing the ticket. I was counting [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2317.84s)]
*  the money and they blew it. This year I'm kind of down on Detroit and I'm in on the cheeseheads [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2323.2000000000003s)]
*  to win the division. It was the moment these unders came out. It was the under that jumped out [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2328.56s)]
*  and I didn't understand why it wasn't 10 or 10 and a half. Super Bowl 19 to one is interesting [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2333.04s)]
*  for them too. The number one seed in the NFC, which I think on Fandl was plus seven 50 best record in [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2339.2000000000003s)]
*  either conference is 17 to one. 12 plus wins for them as plus two 45. You laid out a lot of the [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2347.36s)]
*  case. I mean, it rejuvenated Josh Jacobs would also would also be a fun piece of this, but I really [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2355.36s)]
*  liked their receivers. And it's one of those things where I don't even, I'm not even positive who the [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2360.88s)]
*  best fan is to receiver out of those four guys are, but the totality of it love getting paid. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2365.1200000000003s)]
*  The fans are just all in on this team. And then the juxtaposition of that with Rogers and the [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2371.52s)]
*  jets and whatever is going to happen with that. It just, there's a feel good feeling of that. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2377.36s)]
*  And then how's the other thing you want to say like it's Detroit's year. This is it. This is [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2381.52s)]
*  the year they step up. They're getting a lot of Super Bowl buzz and a lot of hype. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2387.12s)]
*  They had a really awesome year last year. Like you go back and it's, they were 12 and five, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2392.16s)]
*  they beat the Rams, they beat Tampa and they lost by three points in the conference title game. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2397.28s)]
*  Like that was an awesome year. It's hard to do that two years in a row and you have your breakout [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2401.92s)]
*  awesome year. And I'm struggling with them a little bit because I do think [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2407.6800000000003s)]
*  top four, talented roster, no question, top five, top six, somewhere in there. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2412.0800000000004s)]
*  But a lot of things went right for them last year. And I just, I wonder when you have all the [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2418.32s)]
*  expectations now and the hype and the Lions fan base, like, Oh my God, we're going to make [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2423.04s)]
*  the Super Bowl this year. Look at what's happening in the Niners. It's our Dallas is worse. Like [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2429.68s)]
*  Phillies, there's a Sirianni, Hertz didn't get along all last year story and the NFC like, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2433.68s)]
*  this is our time. We have this. And we've just seen with football that a lot of times the football [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2439.2s)]
*  zags when everything is zigging. Where do you stand on them house? I like them, but don't love them. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2444.96s)]
*  I like them at like 10 wins, maybe 11 because they, they were in the zone for 11 wins [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2452.32s)]
*  last season. I want to sit tight for a little bit. And I understand that you're going to lose out on [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2459.92s)]
*  some of the good pricing here on the packers. Yeah. The green Bay Packers. Yeah, exactly. I [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2467.1200000000003s)]
*  want to sit tight and I want to see that defense a little bit because I feel like after watching, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2472.1600000000003s)]
*  I lost a lot of money when Baker Mayfield went out there and beat their ass. I mean, I still, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2477.44s)]
*  I hold that against them and we, we had some money line exposure to them beating San Francisco [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2481.92s)]
*  and that mother effort Carlson, who should have been sent back to Europe as soon as that game was [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2487.6s)]
*  over. Still being in the mix hurts my feelings. So I just have some bitter flavor in my mouth [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2492.96s)]
*  around them, but they for sure are live. I like that NFC North bet. I do still have a lot of [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2500.16s)]
*  respect for Detroit. And I think that Detroit is in as good a position as any to do the hard thing, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2508.0s)]
*  which is, you know, hold up their end of the bargain in a repeat kind of season, but I like [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2513.68s)]
*  green Bay very much. They're in the playoffs. They're a 10 or 11 win team. I don't mean to [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2519.92s)]
*  suggest anything different. I just am not all the way there with the full, uh, ebullience for this [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2524.32s)]
*  one. Couple, couple tough road games for them. And then a couple ones I really like, like they're at [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2531.12s)]
*  the Rams week five. That'll be, I would say 40,000 Packers fans at that game. They're at the Jaguars. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2536.96s)]
*  I don't think the Jaguars would be that good. Uh, they're at Minnesota, which will probably a mess. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2543.6s)]
*  They're at Tennessee. It's funny at Philly Friday night, week one, September 6th. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2548.0s)]
*  That might be the most interesting week one game. And I haven't, I've avoided all the lines, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2555.44s)]
*  but that's the one where I have a lot of questions I want answered about both of those teams. Um, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2560.48s)]
*  and especially as you read, I know you're an Eagles fan to Bundo, but as you read some of the [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2567.2s)]
*  stuff that's trickled out since the season ended and now that we're in training camp and then the [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2571.44s)]
*  big now, now they tell us peace about Syria and hurts. Um, I just have real questions about them. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2575.36s)]
*  I want, I just want to see it like what is this going to get worse or better? Like, cause you [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2583.28s)]
*  could argue Sirianni is a, a first coach fired candidate if it doesn't go up for them right away. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2587.68s)]
*  Or you could argue they're going to be back on track and be awesome. So green Bay going in there. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2593.84s)]
*  And if green Bay just whips the ball around and just kicks their ass, that will feel like the [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2600.32s)]
*  overreaction for week one, right? Packers there for real. Oh my God. Superbowl. We do this every [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2604.96s)]
*  year with week one. And that was the one I circled on the flip side, Philly laying it to them. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2611.6800000000003s)]
*  People have the Eagles, they're back Packers, young team. We'll see Eagles back. So I feel [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2617.6s)]
*  like that's the overreaction game. Are you nervous about that game as an Eagles fan? [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2624.24s)]
*  So it's tricky. My relationship with the Eagles, uh, I live outside of Philadelphia and grew up a [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2630.24s)]
*  Colts fan. So I'm kind of like indifferent about the Eagles. I follow you. You're not an Eagles fan. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2634.7999999999997s)]
*  No, most people assume this. You're Philly. Except the yellow, which is like sacrilegious. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2639.3599999999997s)]
*  Interesting. Yeah. Some have called me a hater just by my nature of being a [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2646.8799999999997s)]
*  Wow. That's really glass half empty. I just assume. Um, so you're, but I'm excited for it. I mean, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2651.6s)]
*  I think it could go so many different ways. Hertz and Sirianni do not seem like the type of [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2657.68s)]
*  personalities that immediately mesh. And based on the reporting in that McManus, Tim McManus story, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2661.6s)]
*  like it doesn't sound like they're on the best of starts. They're going to show for the cameras, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2666.24s)]
*  but at the first sign of trouble, this could, this could still turn really ugly, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2670.64s)]
*  but the talent, like if you just line up talent on talent, this is still one of the three best teams [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2674.96s)]
*  in the NFC by far. So I like Packers nine and a half. And I think as long as that single digits [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2679.2799999999997s)]
*  with the over under, I still feel like that's a really good bet. Well, just quickly about, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2685.2s)]
*  Oh God, the thing about green Bay, if you look at their road schedule, it's actually pretty [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2689.2s)]
*  friendly. So they're going to play the Eagles in Brazil. So they don't have to go to Philly, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2693.2s)]
*  which is a huge swing, right? That Friday night early game, they'll get extra rest coming home [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2697.04s)]
*  for their home opener against Indy. And then if you look at some of their road games, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2701.28s)]
*  they get Jacksonville right after Jacksonville plays two in London, then they go to Chicago, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2705.6800000000003s)]
*  but it's off their bye week. So some of their tougher road games, they go to Seattle, but it's [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2710.6400000000003s)]
*  after extra rest, they'll have 10 days to get ready for that game. So a lot of their big road games [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2715.6800000000003s)]
*  are either not road games at all, or they're in a rest advantage where, you know, another team is [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2720.96s)]
*  at a disadvantage or they're getting extra rest to get ready for them. So I think that's a under [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2725.92s)]
*  rated part of the green Bay schedule. But again, like they're basically a coin flip in week one, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2729.6s)]
*  and that will have a huge leverage in terms of the NFC. How's that look at disappointment on my face [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2734.4s)]
*  was having done five weeks of prep and not realizing that Philly green Bay was in Brazil. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2740.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh, I thought you knew even the great slip up. Yeah. For some reason I had it marked down as [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2745.2s)]
*  that Philly, but this is what happens. We're trying to do 900 things just quickly before we go. You [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2750.16s)]
*  said you're a Colts fan. So over eight and a half for them, division plus three 10, 11 plus wins plus [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2754.8s)]
*  285. They were nine and eight last year. They added a pass rusher. Richardson is back. Just what's your [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2761.36s)]
*  lean? It might be the worst secondary in the NFL, but Richardson is so exciting. I don't know how you [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2768.1600000000003s)]
*  could take an under on them. So I think they're like a nine, 10 win team. So I would, I would lean [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2774.1600000000003s)]
*  to the over, but again, Richardson could go down again and I don't expect Joe Flacco to be able to [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2778.88s)]
*  recreate last year's magic that happens. But yeah, certainly the offense is exciting. The offensive [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2783.84s)]
*  line is the top five unit again, which has not been true for a long time. So the fact that they're kind [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2788.48s)]
*  of back is huge for, for their outlook this season, but yeah, the secondary, they played a lot of bad [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2793.6000000000004s)]
*  QBS last year, got away with it. The corners, it's real ugly. So I think there's some concerns [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2799.2000000000003s)]
*  defensively about Indy. I agree. There's stay away from me. How stay away for you or no? No, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2805.52s)]
*  I bet they're over. Um, I, that's not fair. You've been every team. The Stiken, um, was so impressive [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2810.48s)]
*  last year. I mean, making Gardner Minshew look like a viable quarterback and that team being one play [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2817.84s)]
*  away from making the playoffs. Like that's in the first season, that's that it was so impressive. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2823.12s)]
*  And we get a fully healthy Jonathan Taylor for a full season behind that offensive line. I think [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2829.28s)]
*  Indy's live. All right. That was five favorites and segment that was, we tested out was supposed [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2835.6s)]
*  to be 25 minutes and we went for 50. Anthony Tabundo. Great to see you. Joe House. Thanks as always. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2841.52s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2-7wPqHJE&t=2847.52s)]
