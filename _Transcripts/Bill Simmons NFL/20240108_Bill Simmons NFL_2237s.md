# The Biggest Losers at the End of the NFL Regular Season | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [January 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=0.0s)]
*  So I asked Sal to make a list of all the losers from the last couple of days in the NFL. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1.0s)]
*  And I made that list as well. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=6.4s)]
*  And we're going to have a draft of the biggest losers because there is a lot for some reason, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=7.96s)]
*  more losers than usual. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=12.08s)]
*  I just want to point out before we start this, I'm upset. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=13.96s)]
*  I'll say this every year that we don't have six games in two days for wildcard weekend. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=16.8s)]
*  I hate the Monday game. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Oh, you don't like it? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Screws with guest aligns. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  Kills the podcast. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  Just give me three games each day. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=28.16s)]
*  Football, football, football. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=29.24s)]
*  We're done Saturday night. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  We're breathless. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  We're recapping. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=32.24s)]
*  I hate the Monday thing. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=33.24s)]
*  So I'm NFL's a loser. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=35.04s)]
*  So is that your first pick? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=37.16s)]
*  The schedule maker? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=38.2s)]
*  No, I just I just wanted to point that out. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=39.2s)]
*  I'm giving you first pick. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  Your biggest loser of week 18 was. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=41.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=44.28s)]
*  I am going to. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=45.28s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=46.28s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=47.28s)]
*  I didn't know I'd get the first pick. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=48.28s)]
*  I'll take the first pick. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=49.28s)]
*  Want me to go first? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=50.28s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=51.28s)]
*  You go first. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=52.28s)]
*  I know who you're going to go with. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=53.28s)]
*  You do? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=54.28s)]
*  Well, if our techs exchange is any indication. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=55.28s)]
*  I mean, it dominated Saturday night. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=59.12s)]
*  Oh, I'm going to I'm actually going to take Arthur Smith. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=61.12s)]
*  Oh, all right. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=64.12s)]
*  That's a good one. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=65.12s)]
*  I think he was the biggest loser week 18. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=66.12s)]
*  He goes into the last game of the season as a chance to win the division coaching for [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=68.88s)]
*  his job for better or worse. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  When the Saints team that's pretty beatable, it's 17 to 17 at halftime. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=78.08s)]
*  They they have the ball to start the second half. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=83.72s)]
*  Yeah, interception Saints come down touchdown. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=88.56s)]
*  The Falcons are like, what have we done all year is we've had long drives that have ended [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  absolutely horribly. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=97.96s)]
*  So they have a 14 play drive that includes second and goal from the three leading to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=98.96s)]
*  a fourth down pass. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=103.8s)]
*  Very reminiscent of the Indianapolis pass yesterday. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=105.24s)]
*  Ritter rolls out, has a guy wide open and just throws it throws it the wrong way. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=108.44s)]
*  Incompletion. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=114.28s)]
*  The Saints end up winning the second half, 31, nothing. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=115.44s)]
*  They blow every possible Falcons tease. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=119.16s)]
*  And then at the end of the game, when it looks like they're kneeling, they hand the ball [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  off to Jamal Williams, who scores one last touchdown. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=124.16s)]
*  And Arthur Smith runs out and he's screaming at Dennis Allen, the Saints coach, because [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=127.6s)]
*  he's completely humiliated. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=133.28s)]
*  He's going to get fired tomorrow. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=134.28s)]
*  So I actually think he should have punched him. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=135.6s)]
*  That's the only way he could have salvaged any of this. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=137.44s)]
*  Like an actual haymaker coach fight. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=139.88s)]
*  We haven't had one in a while. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=142.6s)]
*  There was no other way to salvage what happened over those two hours. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=144.24s)]
*  Meanwhile, it wasn't even Dennis Allen's fault, reportedly, because they went rogue on him [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  as they put Jamus in. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  And Jamus says, no, no, this was a team decision to hand off their in victory formation. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  I think Taysom Hill is like at the nine yard line. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=158.60000000000002s)]
*  So either he's not in on it or he is in on it, but they want to disguise it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=161.24s)]
*  And they run Williams to get his first touchdown. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=165.28s)]
*  He led the league. Williams had that touchdown all year and they wanted to get it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=167.96s)]
*  But it's not exactly a Rudy story. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=170.88s)]
*  He guy led the league in touchdowns. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=172.72s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=174.32s)]
*  Why are we giving him that? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=175.32s)]
*  It's not like he's going to the hospital after the game to get chemo or something. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=176.32s)]
*  Right. And hadn't scored yet. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=180.4s)]
*  Yeah. Winston's like, screw you. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=182.28s)]
*  I'll probably be off this team. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=183.6s)]
*  And Dennis Allen, you're not making the playoffs. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=185.04s)]
*  So I don't care what you say. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=186.72s)]
*  So I'm handed in my jersey here. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=188.12s)]
*  But then but I thought you were going to say like Arthur Smith made it so much worse. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=190.28s)]
*  So I think you're right. This was the in-between right. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=194.0s)]
*  Either punch him and make a big deal, go out with a bang. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=196.76s)]
*  You actually have to fight him at that point. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=199.68s)]
*  Right. Or don't say anything. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=200.8s)]
*  Yeah. Or don't say anything because now everybody knows about it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=202.32s)]
*  No one really even knew you before this. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, so he had he starts Ritter again today. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=207.68s)]
*  So he's bouncing back and forth between Heineken Ritter. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=211.4s)]
*  Like he's our wives trying to get ready on Saturday night, holding up two outfits. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=214.6s)]
*  And should I try that? I'm going to try. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  Wait, I thought you tried that out. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=220.88s)]
*  Now I'm trying this one on. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  Now I put the other one on. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=223.24s)]
*  And he's just he's just putting on outfits for the entire NFL season. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=224.48s)]
*  We can't. He's like, should I try Desmond Ritter on again? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=228.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. How does this look? Do you like Ritter on me? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=231.4s)]
*  No, he's going to suck again. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  And then they both split their pants at the event. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=235.32s)]
*  Yeah. A Ritter had a great first half, right? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=238.48s)]
*  Then you have like a memorable first half like Stats. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=240.84s)]
*  But he is just like he's like when he gets to the red zone, he free. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=244.24s)]
*  It's like a shark who is now out of water and has to navigate a volcano or something. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  He really is the worst in the red zone. So funny. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=252.84s)]
*  Arthur Smith, my my first pick. Who do you have? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=255.04s)]
*  All right. Let me stay in the division. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=258.04s)]
*  And it's a division. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=259.68s)]
*  I'm glad that there's only one representative in the playoffs and whatever. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=261.08s)]
*  It's Tampa. I'm not glad it's Tampa Bay because you and I and House had New Orleans [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=264.08s)]
*  and we had no way to hedge it at this point, because if they won, it was an uneditable division bet. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=267.91999999999996s)]
*  It's like impossible. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  They score 48 and the and the Bucks score nine. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=274.96s)]
*  I like for the Panthers. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=277.96s)]
*  Anyway, my loser is both Bryce Young and Scott Fitterer, the GM for the for the Panthers. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=279.52s)]
*  Who's going to be gone tomorrow? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=286.28s)]
*  He's another one. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=287.64000000000004s)]
*  So I don't have to call him a loser because he's definitely gone for this Bryce Young deal. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=288.32000000000005s)]
*  But the fact that we lost that game, we needed the Bucks to lose. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=292.12s)]
*  And Chark fumbles through into the end zone and that Pinero whatever misses a field goal. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=295.36s)]
*  And all they needed was 10 to win that game. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=300.6s)]
*  And now they had they got a touchdown and there was a penalty and it got called back. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=303.12s)]
*  I forgot about that. Right. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=306.76000000000005s)]
*  Five yard touchdown. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=307.56s)]
*  They had a touchdown that was called back. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=308.72s)]
*  They went eight straight quarters without scoring. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=310.52000000000004s)]
*  They never let a game going into the fourth quarter. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=314.0s)]
*  This is I know they had two wins and there's teams with like one win. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=317.16s)]
*  But this is a historically, historically bad team. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=320.20000000000005s)]
*  Of course, I could throw a tepper in there. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=323.36s)]
*  But right now, I'm going to say Bryce and Scott Fitterer. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=325.08000000000004s)]
*  I was screaming for Andy Dalton. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=327.24s)]
*  I was like, who's going to know if Andy Dalton just bench Bryce Young and bring him back? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=328.56s)]
*  Like, do it for me and Simmons. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=332.56s)]
*  You locked up the number and pick for another team. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=333.88s)]
*  Just get one more score for God's sake. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=336.72s)]
*  So there's my loser. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=339.12s)]
*  I'm going to I'm going to follow up on yours. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=340.44000000000005s)]
*  Oh, what? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=343.16s)]
*  So Rudy just texted that the Falcons have fired Arthur Smith. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=345.0s)]
*  They did. Is it because of what you said? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=349.84s)]
*  I think I just got him fired right now. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=352.24s)]
*  Wow. Is he have a camera on us? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=354.16s)]
*  So that's it for Arthur, the least surprising announcement of the year. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=357.08s)]
*  Should we stick around and wait to see if Scott Fitterer and Bryce Young are gone, too? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=360.6s)]
*  Maybe they're next. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=364.72s)]
*  I'm just going to piggyback on yours then, because I had David Tepper as a top four pick. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=366.32s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=370.8s)]
*  That game, they to have to end the season on two scoreless games with your rookie QB, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=372.15999999999997s)]
*  but to not have the wherewithal to bench the rookie QB and be like, you know what? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=379.28s)]
*  Let's we'll regroup. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  We're going to get you better offensive line and some weapons. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=385.44s)]
*  Let's got you a great rookie year. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=387.64s)]
*  We're going to have the veteran in adult and finish it out and then we'll come back strong. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=389.2s)]
*  They don't do that. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=392.96s)]
*  Is the quickest coach firing since 1978, a coach that he hired like last spring. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=394.0s)]
*  Right. Awful. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=399.15999999999997s)]
*  He whiffs on the Stroud versus Bryce pick after he makes this trade with the Bears. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=400.68s)]
*  That now ends up being one of the most lopsided trades, maybe ever. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=405.04s)]
*  He gets fined last week for throwing a drink on somebody. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=408.84000000000003s)]
*  And I think unquestionably, it's crazy. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=412.16s)]
*  Unquestionably, he's the NFL's new worst owner now that Dana Snyder's gone. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=416.08s)]
*  I think he has the championship belt. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=420.36s)]
*  It's like this is like raw where he's just holding the belt up on the top rope. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=422.04s)]
*  Go. Yeah, I love it. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=426.0s)]
*  And I think you're right. Yeah. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=428.6s)]
*  He's got the money in the bank case. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=431.8s)]
*  I I I love it. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=433.32000000000005s)]
*  I think you're right. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=436.28000000000003s)]
*  And I think it's great that it switches. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=437.04s)]
*  It's not always the same owner, right? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=439.24s)]
*  It's not always Mark Davis. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=441.04s)]
*  It's not always. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=442.40000000000003s)]
*  All right. It was Daniel Snyder for a while. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=443.28000000000003s)]
*  But now it's Tepper and it's great. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=445.28000000000003s)]
*  There's that. That's why parity is so great in football, because it could be [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=448.48s)]
*  could be the worst owner. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=452.76000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. And I just lose the title. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=454.04s)]
*  It's thirty two rich guys. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=456.36s)]
*  And you just never know who's going to be the worst. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=458.0s)]
*  You never know who's going to surprise you. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=460.6s)]
*  But he is the fact that you have that season [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=462.12s)]
*  and now you don't have a first round pick. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=465.08000000000004s)]
*  It's like impossible. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=466.84000000000003s)]
*  Her say is like, I'm not top five. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=468.8s)]
*  I'm not even top five worst owners. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=470.76s)]
*  Oh, no, don't get in your car. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=472.76s)]
*  Don't get in your car. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=473.92s)]
*  All right. What's your next pick? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=475.44s)]
*  Oh, I go. OK, I'm going to go. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=477.32s)]
*  All right. Listen, I don't want to sound biased. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=479.36s)]
*  So the Brad Allen blew that call against the Cowboys. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=481.68s)]
*  I do think, you know, we had a kicker that can boot at 70 yards, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=486.04s)]
*  although he showed it was a little shaky today. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=489.0s)]
*  But Brad Allen is the loser and his punishment for being a loser. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=491.12s)]
*  And that for Miss, you know, there's misdeeds in that Cowboys Lions game. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=495.84000000000003s)]
*  They stuck him in that Steelers Ravens game. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=501.56s)]
*  His crew had to do that right in the pouring rain. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=504.48s)]
*  They're like, we want this guy, this guy has to get pneumonia and strep throat [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=507.68s)]
*  so we don't put him on any crew in the playoffs. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=511.48s)]
*  And now they're just going to sit and wait for the results. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=514.04s)]
*  I think it's like Officer and a gentleman where he just has the guy [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=516.0s)]
*  doing exercises in the pouring rain. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=519.7199999999999s)]
*  They're brand. I'm not going to quit. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=522.1999999999999s)]
*  That's nowhere else to go. Yeah. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=525.7199999999999s)]
*  Also a terrible game. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=527.1999999999999s)]
*  I have for my next pick, the. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=528.8399999999999s)]
*  Sadly, the Detroit Lions fans. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=531.8s)]
*  Who? Just feeling great. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=534.5999999999999s)]
*  The Lions fans, there's like this is awesome. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=537.0s)]
*  We're going to be the three seed playoffs. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=539.4s)]
*  They lose Laporta. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=542.1999999999999s)]
*  I can't imagine he's playing next week. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=544.4399999999999s)]
*  Laporta was the best tight end in the league like he was. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=546.5999999999999s)]
*  Definitely the best going forward in the playoffs for sure. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=549.4s)]
*  And yeah, I think Trey McBride might be second. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=552.24s)]
*  Really? Just like watch it, like just watching the last five games of the season. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=557.3199999999999s)]
*  Tight ends who repeatedly just got open and made shit happen. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=560.76s)]
*  I think those were the two impact guys. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=564.0799999999999s)]
*  Is there anyone else you would put? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=566.16s)]
*  I'm trying to think this Kincaid kid is really good. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=568.68s)]
*  Yeah, he was good. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=573.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, you can't put him for the whole year. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=574.3199999999999s)]
*  No, but Laporta was unquestionably number one. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=576.2399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'm with him. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=579.7199999999999s)]
*  Lose him flashbacks a little bit to we lost Welker in the last game in 2010. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=580.9599999999999s)]
*  Heading into he tore his knee and we go in and then we get waxed by Baltimore [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=587.04s)]
*  the Pats back when we were good at stuff. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=592.88s)]
*  But that last week of the year injury AJ Brown to the Eagles. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=596.0s)]
*  But I think the Eagles had bigger problems than that. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=600.28s)]
*  But now they got the Rams coming to Detroit. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=602.6s)]
*  You had Stafford coming back. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=606.04s)]
*  You have goth against McVeigh. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=608.04s)]
*  So it's a whole week of things. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=609.68s)]
*  So instead of this like Detroit Lions celebration, we're in the playoffs. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=610.8s)]
*  Now it's like, oh, shit, we just lost the best tight end in the league. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=614.8s)]
*  We have this guy coming in who's got this hot offense that can totally match us. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=619.16s)]
*  That doesn't care where he plays. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=623.52s)]
*  And then the irony of Stafford coming in and knocking Detroit out of the playoffs. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=624.96s)]
*  I just feel like this is a loss for if you're a Lions fan like, fuck, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=628.76s)]
*  why this team? This had to be the team. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=632.6800000000001s)]
*  This is absolutely this game was going to be hard enough to win. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=635.1600000000001s)]
*  And now it carries ten times the weight because Stafford's coming to town. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=639.32s)]
*  And there's even people saying, like, I heard them on CBS, like Cower. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=642.8000000000001s)]
*  And they're arguing over whether or not Stafford gets a little bit [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=646.36s)]
*  of a ceremony before the game. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=650.0s)]
*  They're like, ceremony. They're going to get beat. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=651.52s)]
*  What are you talking? What are you going to do? Do it after the game. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=653.64s)]
*  But the fact that they're talking about that is let's meet. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=656.16s)]
*  And we'll go over the line in a second. But I think you're right. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=659.96s)]
*  This is a. That would lead to an unbelievable Chris Russo rant. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=662.64s)]
*  If that. Oh, yeah. It's a ceremony. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=666.76s)]
*  They give him a ceremony. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=668.8000000000001s)]
*  He's going to come in and beat your ass around one. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=670.76s)]
*  Send them a gift basket after the game. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=673.5600000000001s)]
*  Don't stop the game. They give them a tribute. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=676.0s)]
*  He's here to beat you. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=678.72s)]
*  All right. What's your next pick? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=681.36s)]
*  All right. You know what? It's a it's a dual entry here. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=684.08s)]
*  I'm going to say, first of all, because you're one of these people, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=686.6s)]
*  anyone who fell for New England minus one and a half [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=689.48s)]
*  talking about how bad they were all year. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=692.6s)]
*  And I labeled this armoring of wise guys like this is a rat line. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=695.24s)]
*  When two bad teams are playing each other and nobody on the planet [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=699.08s)]
*  likes one of them, the Jets and the line is still lower than three. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=702.44s)]
*  Now, I think it went to two and a half. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=706.12s)]
*  But everybody had the Patriots in the slop fest of a game. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=707.5999999999999s)]
*  You guys hate your quarterback. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=711.1999999999999s)]
*  And it just comes down to who has the better running game, right? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=712.7199999999999s)]
*  When it's all slushing around. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=715.16s)]
*  I like your receivers are going to get a better separation. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=716.68s)]
*  That's one part of it. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=719.1999999999999s)]
*  The other loser part is the reporters who continually try to trick [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=720.4399999999999s)]
*  Bill Belichick into answering an actual question in the press conference [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=723.88s)]
*  after the game about his future is like, I don't want to talk about the Jets. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=727.4399999999999s)]
*  If you want to talk about the Jets, I'll talk about the Jets. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=731.4s)]
*  All right, coach. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=733.4s)]
*  And then they try to be cute with it. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=734.4s)]
*  How did this Jets game shape? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=736.0s)]
*  What's going to happen to you in the future and where you're going to be [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=738.16s)]
*  disappointed and what happened with the Jets? Next question. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=740.88s)]
*  OK, does this make you want to quit this game with the Jets? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=743.64s)]
*  Does it make you want to quit football? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=747.6s)]
*  Just very disappointed. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=749.68s)]
*  But next question, I think I addressed that already. Next question. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=750.72s)]
*  And you never get anything out of them. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=753.2s)]
*  So there's a dual loser pick for me. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=754.96s)]
*  Bill, three days from now, when you're in your office [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=758.48s)]
*  thinking about this Jets loss, where would that office be located? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=760.8s)]
*  Possibly. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=765.48s)]
*  What area code would that be in? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=767.2s)]
*  Bill, you're going to go to the bank. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=769.5600000000001s)]
*  Who's going to sign your checks? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=770.88s)]
*  Do you think when you endorse the checks over, which owner would you say? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=772.28s)]
*  Yeah, so a lot. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=777.4s)]
*  I'm going to defend Pat's minus one and a half. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=779.44s)]
*  The snow, I don't think I had any real idea until they went to the game [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=781.9200000000001s)]
*  like 10 minutes before the over and there was like 28. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=787.04s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=790.44s)]
*  But it's just when you saw and then Belichick comes out and they're like, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=791.24s)]
*  he's been under the weather all week, but he's going to go through it. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=794.6800000000001s)]
*  And they show him he's got the hood on with like a ski mask. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=797.88s)]
*  It looked like he was, you know, like in a Blumhouse movie. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=800.5600000000001s)]
*  And and then the first Bailey's Zappie pass. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=804.2s)]
*  I was like, oh, my God. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=807.0s)]
*  I watched Kyle came over and both of us were like, how are you going to score three? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=808.6s)]
*  Is this going to be like a three, nothing final? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=811.96s)]
*  I this leads me to Belichick, which was my next pick for [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=814.12s)]
*  for the losers. You can't pick my pick. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=818.76s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=821.12s)]
*  Well, I guess I didn't pick Belichick. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=822.36s)]
*  OK, you're right. You didn't necessarily pick Belichick. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=823.76s)]
*  That's true. Yeah. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=825.4s)]
*  So here's how it ends for him. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=827.0s)]
*  He loses 17 to three to the team that he hates the most. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=829.3199999999999s)]
*  The New York Jets in a snowstorm. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=833.72s)]
*  He's sick. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=836.84s)]
*  And if you didn't feel sick during the game, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=838.48s)]
*  it definitely got worse as you watch Bailey's Zappie. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=840.76s)]
*  One of the worst football games I've ever watched [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=844.8s)]
*  and Chris Myers was announcing and it was like, if this isn't rock bottom, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=847.48s)]
*  I don't I don't know what else this game needed other. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=852.3599999999999s)]
*  I don't even know what else I would have added. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=856.3599999999999s)]
*  He he was dressed like he was Jack Torrance in The Shining about to walk through the maze. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=859.0s)]
*  I just don't I just don't understand it. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=865.3599999999999s)]
*  So I it's going to open up to all this. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=868.52s)]
*  Well, if he leaves and people are going to pick apart the legacy. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=871.76s)]
*  And the big thing is he was 36 and 44 in Cleveland. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=875.0s)]
*  He was five and 13 with Drew Bledsoe. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=879.1999999999999s)]
*  He was 11 and five with Matt Castle. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=882.3199999999999s)]
*  And then he was 29 and 38 after Brady. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=884.0799999999999s)]
*  It's just mediocrity everywhere, except for that Castle season where they didn't make [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=886.8s)]
*  He needs Castle back. We've been saying that for a while. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=889.9599999999999s)]
*  The Castle thing does does screw up the can't run without Brady theme. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=893.28s)]
*  But the reality is all of his success became came with Brady. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=896.9599999999999s)]
*  I think he's the greatest coach of all time. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=901.88s)]
*  I was there day in, day out watching him and supporting the team. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=904.4799999999999s)]
*  He did 100 million things that make me think, like, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=907.4799999999999s)]
*  you can't say it was all because of Brady. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=911.44s)]
*  But I do feel like the way those last four years went. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=913.2s)]
*  It does open the door for that argument. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=917.7600000000001s)]
*  It's a it's a bummer. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=919.6400000000001s)]
*  And the reality is they needed each other. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=921.1600000000001s)]
*  And I don't think anybody can win without a QB. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=923.24s)]
*  Andy Reid was that last Andy Reid Eagle season was four and 12. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=925.24s)]
*  Yeah, you know, QB, you're just not going to win his QBs. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=928.96s)]
*  I mean, the Zappie Mac Jones combo, I think, was even worse than Ritter and Heinecke. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=933.6800000000001s)]
*  I think it was worse than anybody, anybody had, except maybe Carolina. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=939.4s)]
*  It was pretty grim. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=945.04s)]
*  But I think he's going to I think it's over. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=945.92s)]
*  And all indications seem to be the Pats are ready to move on. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=949.3199999999999s)]
*  Maybe he takes a year off, maybe somebody trades for him. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=952.28s)]
*  But it really does seem like it's over. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=954.5999999999999s)]
*  And this was the worst way for a 10. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=956.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, you said last week you wanted him back. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=957.92s)]
*  That was a big announcement. Yeah, you want to back. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=960.0s)]
*  And you want to go on and back. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=962.4799999999999s)]
*  But you don't want him calling the shots. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=964.48s)]
*  He and all those great things he did. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=966.36s)]
*  OK, let's say he could still do them. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=968.12s)]
*  He can't revive this current team. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=970.0s)]
*  He's got to figure they got to get someone in there. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=972.68s)]
*  Those receive you. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=975.52s)]
*  You can blame the quarterback. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=976.52s)]
*  You can blame the receivers. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=977.48s)]
*  I feel like the Texans receivers aren't that great. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=978.48s)]
*  Honestly, I feel like going into the season is Nikko Collinson. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=981.48s)]
*  That's it. No. Yeah, I get it. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=984.28s)]
*  But it's like, yeah, why? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=986.24s)]
*  And they still move the ball. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=988.5600000000001s)]
*  And I know they have a quarterback that's that's pretty dynamite. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=989.44s)]
*  But these guys get separation. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=991.96s)]
*  I feel like I watch I watch the same games as you. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=994.32s)]
*  And I don't want to blame a client. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=997.04s)]
*  Just I want to manage your expectations. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=998.92s)]
*  If you get like a Jaden Daniels next year and it's still not working. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1001.52s)]
*  That's all I want to do. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1005.4399999999999s)]
*  I assume that's who they're going to get. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1009.0799999999999s)]
*  Because it seems like this is now a top three is all QB's [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1011.56s)]
*  before it seemed like a top two. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1015.0799999999999s)]
*  Now it really does seem like it's going to be one, two, three. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1016.4399999999999s)]
*  And they'll just take whoever falls to them at three, which I'm fine with. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1020.0s)]
*  But this was grim. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1022.64s)]
*  I got to say it was I was bummed out. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1025.48s)]
*  So was Kyle, because it wasn't just that they lost. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1028.0s)]
*  It was like watching them walk off at the end. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1030.4399999999998s)]
*  He's got like the ski mask. It's like almost over his face. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1032.9199999999998s)]
*  He looked like freaking Kenny in South Park. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1035.6399999999999s)]
*  It just was. And it's the Jets, right? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1038.76s)]
*  You had one at what? 15 in a row against them. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1041.24s)]
*  Yeah. And they're the snow angels. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1043.36s)]
*  Like it was pretty good. All right. What's your next one? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1045.08s)]
*  OK, let me see what's left on my list. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1047.84s)]
*  Did we did I mention that brain dead conspiracy theorist, the number 12? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1050.48s)]
*  OK, no. All right. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1054.68s)]
*  You know what? I'm going to jump in front of this one. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1056.2s)]
*  I'll say Tyler Goodson. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1059.24s)]
*  I know you love him. He's your favorite player in the league. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1061.52s)]
*  He caught six passes all year or his career. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1064.64s)]
*  I'm not sure what it was. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1067.72s)]
*  And then this is a dual entry because I had money on the Colts. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1068.96s)]
*  I had a nice same game parlor that was about to come in. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1072.1200000000001s)]
*  And then they blew it. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1074.8400000000001s)]
*  They went on fourth down and Goodson was wide open. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1075.8400000000001s)]
*  The throw was a little bit behind him. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1079.3200000000002s)]
*  I watched it a million times. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1080.72s)]
*  It was the only could have caught it. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1082.0400000000002s)]
*  Whatever. It's a two yard nice catch. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1084.48s)]
*  It would have been a fine catch. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1086.6s)]
*  It's a two and a half yard route. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1088.44s)]
*  Turns around. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1090.04s)]
*  There you go. I'll blame him. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1092.24s)]
*  Not great that Jonathan Taylor went out of bounds when he could have turned it up [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1093.92s)]
*  and gotten an extra yard or half a yard in the first down. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1097.16s)]
*  And not great that the coach Stiken, who I really still think [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1099.84s)]
*  called a great play with Goodson, and he caught it. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1103.0s)]
*  Not great that he bled the clock and called the timeout on himself [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1105.96s)]
*  with fourth down one that he could have used. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1109.72s)]
*  So there you go. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1112.0s)]
*  I'm going to probably take the Colts as a whole as a loser. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1112.76s)]
*  So I'll just piggyback on that. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1116.48s)]
*  I had Stiken because that last drive, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1118.1999999999998s)]
*  the entire conceit of the drive was we just want to chew up clock. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1121.1599999999999s)]
*  We don't want to give Houston back. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1124.72s)]
*  And it was a drive born out of fear. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1126.6399999999999s)]
*  They should have won the game. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1129.0s)]
*  They were so concerned about chewing up clock [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1130.9599999999998s)]
*  that it ends up that fourth downplay. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1134.8s)]
*  To me, that was so much worse than Tyler Goodson dropping it. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1137.24s)]
*  Like you're going to run off 35 seconds and then call timeout. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1140.08s)]
*  Now it's like this place do or die, because if you don't get it, right. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1144.04s)]
*  Your season's over. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1147.0s)]
*  If you call the timeout right, heading into fourth down. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1148.28s)]
*  Then at least if you don't get it, you still have a chance to get the ball back. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1152.1999999999998s)]
*  Listen, we argued about it on text. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1155.76s)]
*  If we if we published our text threads with me, you house and hench. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1157.8799999999999s)]
*  I think we we texted about it for an hour and a half. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1161.9199999999998s)]
*  I will. I'm just playing my flag on this for the rest of my life. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1165.04s)]
*  I never want to have the ice cold guy decide the game when it's a big game. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1168.68s)]
*  And this goes by, I mentioned this stupid example of the Clippers. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1172.72s)]
*  Any Clipper fan knows what I'm about to say without me even saying it. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1176.04s)]
*  Game four, Phoenix 2006, they're up three timeout. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1180.0s)]
*  Mike Dunleavy thinks he'd be super smart. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1183.6s)]
*  Brings in Daniel Ewing off the bench ice cold to garden the corner. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1185.8s)]
*  Roger Bell, of course, is ice cold, forgets to get his hand out. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1189.8s)]
*  Roger Bell three tie game overtime. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1193.44s)]
*  Suns win. But it's I just don't like ice cold people in big spots. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1195.64s)]
*  That's my rule in life. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1199.16s)]
*  OK, but making a three is much harder than catching a two yard pass. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1201.1200000000001s)]
*  If you just have to move a little bit to your left. Right. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1205.16s)]
*  I'm not letting Tyler Goodson decide my season. That's on the coach. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1208.8000000000002s)]
*  But then you hate then you hate every anytime a 350 pound lineman catches it. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1211.92s)]
*  Like you must have been rip shit about Dan Campbell. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1216.1200000000001s)]
*  Forget about how it turned out with the knowledge of Matt. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1218.3200000000002s)]
*  That was a bad call for his season. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1220.64s)]
*  He's not going to do that with the season on the line. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1222.44s)]
*  Well, it was a big play. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1224.44s)]
*  The two seed was on the line. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1226.04s)]
*  Whatever their whole season. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1227.52s)]
*  But you could always find someone who's had more reps like they could have drawn [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1229.16s)]
*  the Jamiro Gibbs or something. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1233.08s)]
*  The fact is, nobody's covering this guy because he has six catches all year. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1234.6s)]
*  He's wide open. And that's why it's a good call. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1238.52s)]
*  Tyler Goodson. That's why I dropped it. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1240.48s)]
*  We can go back and forth. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1242.24s)]
*  Give me a wide open guy. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1243.84s)]
*  Give me a wide open guy on fourth and one every single time. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1245.44s)]
*  I don't care who he is. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1248.16s)]
*  If he has hands, then he can catch the ball. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1249.04s)]
*  Let's bring in Chris Russo. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1251.84s)]
*  And he's down against it. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1253.32s)]
*  I would have run that play with Josh Downs. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1257.1599999999999s)]
*  You want to add my running back, somebody who actually [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1262.04s)]
*  had the athletic ability to make the way. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1265.2s)]
*  Also, like terrible play by Minshew. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1267.24s)]
*  And he was bad. And he's to me, another reason they lost. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1269.28s)]
*  Like he proved that it's really hard to get to the play. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1272.48s)]
*  That's why they ran to Minshew. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1275.08s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. I guess we agree. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1276.4399999999998s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, I called him as the loser, but I think I think he could have called it. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1278.96s)]
*  All right. You got another one. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1283.0s)]
*  Well, we need to do Doug Peterson and Trevor Lawrence. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1285.72s)]
*  Which one do you want to take? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1288.44s)]
*  Who that needs to just be this round, both of them. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1289.84s)]
*  So do you want Doug Peterson or you want Trevor Lawrence? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1292.08s)]
*  I'll take Trevor Lawrence. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1296.2s)]
*  OK, good. I'll do Doug Peterson. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1297.6399999999999s)]
*  So other than the 2017 Eagle season, he is forty seven and forty nine as a head coach. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1299.08s)]
*  His two thousand twenty three Jaguars team was two and oh in London and seven and eight in America. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1306.08s)]
*  He lost five of his last six, starting with an OT loss to Jake Browning. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1311.48s)]
*  I went back and I looked at his playoff success. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1317.72s)]
*  So you remember their first playoff win, the Eagles? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1322.0s)]
*  This I went down an Eagles rabbit hole during the Miami game that actually got pretty dark. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1324.04s)]
*  I'd forgotten this. I blocked that out of my mind. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1329.64s)]
*  Do you remember their first playoff win? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1331.4s)]
*  The Eagles, the year they won this. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1333.68s)]
*  Was it against the Bears that kick the bad kick? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1335.04s)]
*  No, that was the next year. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1338.04s)]
*  Oh, I don't know. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1339.4399999999998s)]
*  That was the Atlanta Falcons. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1340.6s)]
*  They're down five. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1344.24s)]
*  They get a first down. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1345.96s)]
*  First, they go from the eight yard line. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1348.28s)]
*  There's like a minute and a half left. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1350.28s)]
*  First and goal first play. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1352.3999999999999s)]
*  I watched on YouTube. I was fucking going nuts. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1354.04s)]
*  First play was a terrible fade to Julio Jones in the end zone. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1356.6s)]
*  No chance. Second down was this awful shovel pass that almost seemed like it was going to be an interception. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1359.8799999999999s)]
*  So now it's third down from the eight. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1365.56s)]
*  They throw over the middle, seven yard catch. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1367.8s)]
*  So now it's fourth and two. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1369.8s)]
*  Do you remember the fourth and two play their whole season? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1371.52s)]
*  Was it something it wasn't with Julio? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1373.6s)]
*  Or maybe it was. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1375.56s)]
*  It was the classic awful fade where he's completely covered and he's going out of bounds if he catches it. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1377.28s)]
*  So they win that one. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1384.28s)]
*  Then they get to play Minnesota the next round, who had just won because that stupid Stephon Diggs play, the miracle play. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1385.68s)]
*  And it should have been the Saints. They beat them. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1392.04s)]
*  And then this is what killed me. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1394.6399999999999s)]
*  I swear I haven't watched one play of this game other than the occasional highlights. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1396.08s)]
*  The Eagles, Patts, Super Bowl. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1399.28s)]
*  Do you realize in the Super Bowl, we ran for 113 yards and threw for 505 and we lost? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1401.08s)]
*  Wow. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1409.6s)]
*  We had 618 yards of offense and we lost to Nick Foles. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1410.04s)]
*  We lost to Nick Foles and we had 618 yards of offense. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1416.1599999999999s)]
*  I was so fucking mad. I left a long voicemail on a hench. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1419.72s)]
*  I just left him one of those voice texts. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1423.12s)]
*  I'm just reading him stats. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1425.1999999999998s)]
*  It's usually the other way around. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1426.84s)]
*  Well, the greatest coach ever screwed that up, it sounds like. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1428.4799999999998s)]
*  Well, so then Peterson goes to Jacksonville and he's done not that much there. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1431.76s)]
*  And I guess my point is that I'm not too sure about Doug Peterson because that game losing to Tennessee today was fucking awful. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1436.36s)]
*  Like awful. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1443.1999999999998s)]
*  Ryan Tannehill. Tannehill is trying to throw them picks to keep them in it. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1444.4399999999998s)]
*  It was awful. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1448.6s)]
*  Yeah. So I'm all right. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1449.76s)]
*  I agree with all of it and I have the same reasoning for Trevor Lawrence, except I hate picking on an injured guy. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1451.4s)]
*  Like we kind of know he was injured going in. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1456.76s)]
*  I feel like Baker was injured too. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1458.72s)]
*  He was terrible under through. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1460.64s)]
*  Evans was wide open, but whatever. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1463.28s)]
*  It was a whole different thing. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1465.4s)]
*  Trevor Lawrence, let's remember what happened last year with this team, right? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1468.04s)]
*  They win that week 18 game on the road. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1472.1200000000001s)]
*  It was like a defensive touchdown against Tennessee in that Saturday night game. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1475.08s)]
*  Shouldn't even made the playoffs. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1478.56s)]
*  They make the playoffs. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1479.76s)]
*  They blow a gigantic lead. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1480.88s)]
*  Chargers do because they're the Chargers. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1482.64s)]
*  And then the immortal Brandon Staley, who's never going to coach again in the NFL. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1485.1200000000001s)]
*  He's gone. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1488.68s)]
*  And they lose an unlosable game to the Chiefs if you really look at it. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1489.72s)]
*  Right. And what happens? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1493.6000000000001s)]
*  They come out of that and Trevor Lawrence is well, you know, he's a top five quarterback going into 2020. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1494.8000000000002s)]
*  They're like, really? Is he? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1500.0800000000002s)]
*  OK, well, he's definitely better than Dax. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1501.6000000000001s)]
*  So you better shut up. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1503.4s)]
*  All right. Fine. I guess he is. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1504.72s)]
*  And then they're eight and three. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1506.3600000000001s)]
*  Now, I know he's heard a couple of these games. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1507.8000000000002s)]
*  You and I are talking about maybe number one seed. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1509.44s)]
*  Like, what are the odds for the Jacks to get the number one seed? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1512.1200000000001s)]
*  Because they have such an easy schedule the rest of the way. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1514.16s)]
*  How did they blow this? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1516.48s)]
*  They really this and I had Tennessee and I think you had Tennessee, too. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1517.5600000000002s)]
*  It's like there's just it's razor thin in that division. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1521.2800000000002s)]
*  It really is. It's all bad. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1524.96s)]
*  It's so little space in the margin. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1526.8000000000002s)]
*  Tennessee not even trying to win. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1528.2s)]
*  Vrabel might not be come back. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1530.1200000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, they're probably going to beat Jackson or come close. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1531.5600000000002s)]
*  What do you think Trevor Lawrence's career record is? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1535.16s)]
*  Not going to years, is it? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1539.72s)]
*  How many years? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1541.4s)]
*  It's three and a half, three, three. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1543.3600000000001s)]
*  Twenty one, twenty three, twenty and thirty. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1548.76s)]
*  Twenty and thirty. Wow. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1551.92s)]
*  One on one in the playoffs. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1553.1200000000001s)]
*  I was thinking there's three types of number one overall picks, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1554.4s)]
*  and we'll find out which one this year's pick will be in twenty twenty four. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1557.3600000000001s)]
*  You get the stud. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1562.3200000000002s)]
*  You get the bust. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1564.44s)]
*  And then you get like Drew Bledsoe. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1566.96s)]
*  Where it's like pretty good. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1570.0800000000002s)]
*  Sniffing around top five, top six, maybe has a season that looks like an all [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1573.68s)]
*  process, you can win games with them, make the Super Bowl with them. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1578.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you get to the super. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1581.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he got us the 96 Super Bowl, won a couple of playoff games with them. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1583.3600000000001s)]
*  Really fun. Not great, but very good. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1586.44s)]
*  And it's usually those are the three categories. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1590.92s)]
*  And I guess Lawrence is maybe we thought he was going to be a stud. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1593.2s)]
*  Maybe he's Bledsoe. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1597.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't even think he's been Bledsoe. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1599.7199999999998s)]
*  But he's not a bus. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1602.52s)]
*  This is the year if you're fifth or seventh to rise up the ranks, right? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1604.04s)]
*  Like everybody like, oh, Herbert, oh, Tua, you know, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1608.04s)]
*  you don't think the same about those guys. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1611.36s)]
*  And now Lawrence, like it is disappointing that those three guys [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1613.12s)]
*  are just didn't take the next step. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1615.9599999999998s)]
*  If the Jags caught the Bears and said, we'll give you Lawrence for the number one. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1618.6s)]
*  What do the Bears say? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1621.8s)]
*  What do the Bears say? Yeah. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1624.56s)]
*  Now, the Bears have to say no, I think I don't do that. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1628.36s)]
*  OK, number two pick Washington. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1632.36s)]
*  The Jags caught Washington and say, we'll give you Trevor Lawrence for the second pick. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1636.7199999999998s)]
*  That I might do. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1643.12s)]
*  I might. I don't know why. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1645.4399999999998s)]
*  I just I'm with you with the established quarterback so he can win a division, although. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1646.6799999999998s)]
*  I'm not sure. I don't know. What do you do? You do that? [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1652.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't know enough about the quarterbacks, but it is like and then the right pass. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1654.72s)]
*  So they call one of the crafts calls me is like, hey, man, big fan of the podcast. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1658.84s)]
*  It's Jonathan Graff there. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1664.1200000000001s)]
*  Just want to get your take on this trade. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1665.48s)]
*  Jacksonville offered us Trevor Lawrence for the third pick. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1667.28s)]
*  Would you do it? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1669.96s)]
*  You got to do it and you got to do it in a voice. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1671.8s)]
*  You have to respond. I don't think I would do it. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1674.76s)]
*  Really? Yeah, because he's got this big contract coming up [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1677.04s)]
*  and I'm not sure how good he is, but it would be great if he did. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1680.48s)]
*  How good he is. But you could say like, oh, he's hurt. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1683.72s)]
*  He's banged up this year. OK. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1685.88s)]
*  It seemed like he had good receivers. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1689.76s)]
*  Maybe I do it. I guess you would just watch tape and try to talk yourself into it. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1692.24s)]
*  But I think like another way to look at it is look at the last 20 guys drafted [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1695.72s)]
*  and he was still in the top echelon of those. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1700.08s)]
*  Right. And you could say he had didn't have his left tackle. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1703.04s)]
*  Yeah. Kirk got her like they had some timely injuries in the in bad spots. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1706.04s)]
*  And he got her. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1710.3600000000001s)]
*  And you beat the Washington, the number two for Trevor Lawrence is an interesting one. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1711.48s)]
*  So now you're putting him in Washington with no offensive line. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1717.56s)]
*  All right. Loser draft. I only have a couple more. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1719.8s)]
*  Do you have any more? I have like two more. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1721.96s)]
*  I have like one or two more. Yeah. All right. Go. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1723.44s)]
*  All right. I have. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1726.92s)]
*  You say, all right, anyone. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1730.92s)]
*  OK, anyone who has a fantasy league that ends in week 18, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1732.3600000000001s)]
*  if you had to start like a draft just Jeff Driscoll in a league 18. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1736.2s)]
*  I mean, for God's sakes, I mean, like my my sons in one. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1740.88s)]
*  I'm like, just get out of that. That's garbage. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1743.8400000000001s)]
*  You know, picking up Jordan Mason for 50 dollars. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1746.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. Enough. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1748.72s)]
*  We've seen enough. These games are hard enough to figure out. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1750.88s)]
*  So that's just that's good. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1753.1200000000001s)]
*  I have Drake May. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1755.64s)]
*  So the way this shakes out, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1758.68s)]
*  he's going to be the second pick or the third pick, right? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1760.7600000000002s)]
*  People seem to be van was telling me today that [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1762.96s)]
*  people think Jaden Daniels is going to go to the combine [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1766.1200000000001s)]
*  and everyone's going to lose their mind [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1768.3200000000002s)]
*  because he's going to run like a four three. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1770.0s)]
*  And they're really Jesus Christ, this guy is like tall or Lamar. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1771.5200000000002s)]
*  Like, how does he not go second? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1774.7600000000002s)]
*  Regardless, Drake May is going to go second or third. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1776.2s)]
*  So either he goes to Washington. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1779.0s)]
*  They have no offensive line, they have no coach, no GM, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1782.0400000000002s)]
*  and they have an owner who just gave us the process with the Philadelphia 76ers. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1784.8000000000002s)]
*  That's choice a choice B. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1789.0800000000002s)]
*  He goes to New England, no Belichick, literally no skilled guys. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1791.5200000000002s)]
*  And you're in Tom Brady's shadow as part of this rebuild [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1795.24s)]
*  with God only knows how that's going to go. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1798.76s)]
*  Cold weather, both situations. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1801.0s)]
*  Those are your two options. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1802.8s)]
*  That's a pretty two pretty big strikes coming out of the gate [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1804.72s)]
*  versus like, oh, that would be so cool if so and so traded up for me. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1808.6s)]
*  And I got to play in a dump like Atlanta moves up from eight to two. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1812.6s)]
*  And now I get all these weapons and I'm in a dome. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1816.2s)]
*  Instead, I'm in Washington with like nothing. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1818.76s)]
*  So I feel like he's a loser somehow. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1821.64s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1823.92s)]
*  And that's you'd love to know behind the scenes with them. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1825.12s)]
*  I mean, that's a documentary you want to do right now. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1828.04s)]
*  And forget about these quarterback ones. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1830.08s)]
*  It's like you stay with the guy all year, watch games with them on Sunday [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1831.6s)]
*  and see which team they dread the most playing at. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1835.6399999999999s)]
*  Oh, that would like college quarterbacks on Netflix. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1838.36s)]
*  Yeah. Just sit there. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1841.36s)]
*  And as they're watching the sewage pour out of the drains and Washington Stadium, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1842.8s)]
*  like, oh, my God, that's where I'm going. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1847.28s)]
*  Do I have any eligibility left? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1850.44s)]
*  Can I claim COVID? No. OK. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1852.12s)]
*  He's rooting for the for the Jets to beat the Patriots. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1854.76s)]
*  Yeah. Or for the Pats to beat the Jets. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1857.68s)]
*  One more quickie loser, Dak Prescott. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1862.16s)]
*  What? Why? Bear with me. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1865.1200000000001s)]
*  I won't. If I told him for the year, Dak Prescott. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1867.88s)]
*  We'll get the two seed. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1872.52s)]
*  He's going to throw for 4600 yards. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1874.68s)]
*  There are 36 touchdowns, nine picks, 72.7 QBR. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1877.5600000000002s)]
*  He's going to have a couple of huge games in the clutch. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1883.5600000000002s)]
*  He's going to turn CD Lamb into a top three receiver in the league. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1886.6s)]
*  And every single Cowboys fan will be like, Dak has answered every fucking question [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1890.6399999999999s)]
*  I ever had about this guy. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1894.36s)]
*  You would say, oh, well, then he won the MVP, right? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1895.96s)]
*  And it's like, no, Jackson did. OK. Yeah. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1899.48s)]
*  What else did Dax never win in the MVP if it didn't happen this year with the media? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1902.56s)]
*  Dallas, all that stuff behind him. And he still couldn't win. Right. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1906.72s)]
*  My buddy, you're right. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1909.2s)]
*  And I'm glad you took that that. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1910.56s)]
*  Yeah, I zagged. I know. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1912.6399999999999s)]
*  You did. It's pretty good. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1914.44s)]
*  I was like, well, how can you say anything bad about it with all those stats behind it? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1915.56s)]
*  But my buddy, the parlay kid who, you know, we would say in this, we're like, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1918.48s)]
*  how is Dak not MVP? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1921.8s)]
*  And it really is the narrative of who played who, when it right. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1923.44s)]
*  It's like if the Cowboys, I'll tell you what, the schedule maker again is the bad guy [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1927.3600000000001s)]
*  because these division games in week 18 suck. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1931.88s)]
*  They really don't. A lot of them don't matter and they should matter. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1935.8400000000001s)]
*  So put them in the time of the year when they do matter. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1939.3600000000001s)]
*  Don't play the Chargers and Chiefs and don't play the, you know, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1942.0s)]
*  the Browns and Bengals in week 18 when they don't matter or they kind of matter [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1945.24s)]
*  like they did tonight. So and then you're left with the Dak [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1948.92s)]
*  in a loser game against Washington. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1952.1200000000001s)]
*  He puts up giant stats and they're like, well, it doesn't matter. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1953.8000000000002s)]
*  It's Washington. They suck. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1956.0800000000002s)]
*  He's getting no credit for that. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1957.44s)]
*  Marge action, who sat who actually sat is going to get the MVP. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1958.92s)]
*  So I'm with you. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1962.6000000000001s)]
*  And I appreciate that. You have any more? [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1963.92s)]
*  I'm going to say, oh, maybe. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1967.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah. This [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1971.12s)]
*  the clerk at seven eleven who argued with our friend [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1972.92s)]
*  Brad, who tried to buy Kodiak tobacco. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1975.52s)]
*  And what happened? [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1978.24s)]
*  Well, I had custody of our crazy friend Brad for a couple of days. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1980.36s)]
*  He's like, yeah, I'd like to come over. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1984.32s)]
*  I was like, OK, I alert the family and Brad staying over for a couple of nights. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1986.6399999999999s)]
*  And we go to seven eleven because he chews tobacco and spits it in every cup [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1990.56s)]
*  around the house and doesn't tell anybody where where everything is. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1994.36s)]
*  And so but when he gets there, they're like, no, no, no. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=1996.8799999999999s)]
*  No good. It's a city ordinance. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2001.3999999999999s)]
*  We don't sell it there. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2003.56s)]
*  And that should have been enough. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2004.8s)]
*  But Brad, that goes in lambastis guy as if he is going down to town. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2006.08s)]
*  He's Bear Care and Bass. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2010.48s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. He's making the decision. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2011.8s)]
*  And but shame on this seven eleven clerk [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2014.24s)]
*  for not selling it, despite the fact that it's against the law. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2018.1599999999999s)]
*  Is it against the law here? [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2021.6s)]
*  No, we had to go two towns over and I got fine. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2023.76s)]
*  It was just a town order. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2026.76s)]
*  And where do you live? The fucking town from Footloose? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2027.92s)]
*  That's why that's exactly right. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2030.2399999999998s)]
*  No dancing, no spitting tobacco. That's it. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2031.8s)]
*  I have I have two more quickie losers. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2035.08s)]
*  One is Mac Jones, who lost his job to Billy Zappi, who's terrible, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2037.76s)]
*  who had six first downs today. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2042.6s)]
*  Mac Jones was also passed on the depth chart by Nathan work. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2044.32s)]
*  Like, oh, wow. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2048.3199999999997s)]
*  I we call it. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2049.3599999999997s)]
*  I were like high fiving for a month after they drafted Mac Jones. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2050.48s)]
*  I was so excited for the for the year. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2053.48s)]
*  He had better stats than Zappi. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2056.4s)]
*  Zappi had six starts, six touchdowns, nine picks, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2058.36s)]
*  twenty three point two QBR, like just off all in every respect. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2063.08s)]
*  And somehow people were like, it's better than Mac Jones. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2066.6s)]
*  Then my other one is just the Eagles fans. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2070.56s)]
*  You know, we've been talking about them for the last couple of weeks, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2073.84s)]
*  but what what's happened to them? [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2076.1200000000003s)]
*  They have that gauntlet of those four hard games where it's like, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2077.7200000000003s)]
*  there's a lot of a lot of holes in this Eagles case. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2081.1600000000003s)]
*  But, you know, maybe they'll figure it out. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2084.52s)]
*  And instead, it goes the other way. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2086.0s)]
*  And by the time it gets to this Giants game, which was the weirdest, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2087.16s)]
*  I thought that was a rat line. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2089.8799999999997s)]
*  It's like, why are the Giants getting five and a half points [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2091.24s)]
*  against this shit Eagles team that the moment Dallas has the Washington game [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2094.16s)]
*  wrapped up, they're going to, you know, go in the tank. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2098.12s)]
*  Well, turns out they went in the tank the first minute of the game. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2101.3999999999996s)]
*  They're down 24, nothing. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2104.12s)]
*  Their defense is such a sieve. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2106.3999999999996s)]
*  It's hard to imagine them stopping any NFC offense. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2109.0s)]
*  AJ Brown gets hurt. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2112.16s)]
*  Jalen Hurts gets hurt. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2113.64s)]
*  The defense, the Matt Patricia thing, he's like the freaking it follows monster. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2115.4s)]
*  Like wherever he goes, they just people start dying. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2119.84s)]
*  And and if I'm an Eagles fan, I'm just going nuts. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2122.48s)]
*  And it's been a five year grace period now since Super Bowl. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2127.2400000000002s)]
*  It's been six years since they won. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2129.92s)]
*  Yeah, they're allowed to go crazy. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2132.48s)]
*  But they had this embarrassment of riches and Howie Roseman. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2134.8s)]
*  Oh, my God, how did he pull all this off? What a genius. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2138.84s)]
*  And they have this loaded D line. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2142.52s)]
*  She'll Capati and I broke it down on Thursday. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2144.56s)]
*  All these big picks and fridge signings. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2146.68s)]
*  Georgia, Georgia. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2148.64s)]
*  Yeah, they can't get a pass rush. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2150.6s)]
*  They can't stop anything. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2152.8s)]
*  And they can't run the ball. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2154.2s)]
*  They have this great offensive line. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2155.64s)]
*  And and every week with hurts, he looks worse and looks less durable. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2157.88s)]
*  And this is the I can't wait to play this team in round one team. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2163.28s)]
*  I think it's almost even worse than how you explained it, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2168.0s)]
*  because the way it has been usually is the loser of the Super Bowl [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2170.4s)]
*  then just goes to shit the next year for whatever reason. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2174.2000000000003s)]
*  Maybe the the bang bang, the buck, the trend. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2176.56s)]
*  But Philly loses on, you know, a questionable call in the Super Bowl. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2179.48s)]
*  They then go 10 and one. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2183.64s)]
*  So they fool you into thinking, oh, they're going to be a one seed. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2185.2000000000003s)]
*  They're going to be great. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2187.6s)]
*  Better even than the Jacks Jacksonville did to them. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2188.56s)]
*  And then they get to this point. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2191.2400000000002s)]
*  And we saw they've lost five. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2192.6s)]
*  They could have lost on Christmas Day to to the Giants. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2193.84s)]
*  Like, OK. And then they got like idiots like me and you trying to nuance [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2196.48s)]
*  the lines like, all right, they're going to play hard in the first half. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2200.12s)]
*  So I like the Eagles minus two and a half in the first half. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2203.12s)]
*  They'll they'll scoreboard watch and the Cowboys are winning. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2207.04s)]
*  They'll take them out. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2209.52s)]
*  No, they're just going to go out there and get their asses [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2210.3199999999997s)]
*  kicked by Tyron Taylor and Tommy DeVito. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2212.2s)]
*  What the hell is that? [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2214.7599999999998s)]
*  As a cowboy, I'm like, oh, why aren't they trying or are they trying? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2216.3199999999997s)]
*  Have they taken hurts out and and then hurts hurts his finger and everything? [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2220.04s)]
*  Yeah, they're they're a mess going in there. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMVxn0-u2_o&t=2224.24s)]
