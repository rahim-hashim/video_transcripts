# Shedeur Sanders to Cleveland (???) plus NFL Draft Scoops With Todd McShay | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=0.0s)]
*  We're bringing in the new owner of the Boston Celtics, Todd McShay. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=0.5s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=3.08s)]
*  Can't wait to see what you do with the team. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=4.08s)]
*  Pretty good money they got for that, huh? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=6.76s)]
*  Quite the investment. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=8.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=9.42s)]
*  Big six with no arena. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=9.92s)]
*  So you have the McShay show for us. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=11.42s)]
*  You have the McShay report of excellent newsletter that is really becoming, um, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=14.46s)]
*  more and more exciting as we're within five weeks of the NFL draft. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=19.88s)]
*  And I have some special interests because my favorite team is picking forth. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=23.68s)]
*  But I wanted to go through some of the stuff you have in here. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=27.54s)]
*  I feel bad. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=30.38s)]
*  I, anytime I have you on, I feel like I'm stealing something from Rosillo. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=31.02s)]
*  Did it, do I have to work this out with them? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=35.06s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=36.62s)]
*  I just feel like I'm going to his fridge and grabbing like his grapefruit juice [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=37.62s)]
*  and taking like a big swig. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=40.9s)]
*  No, you're like, you're like team Rosillo. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=42.58s)]
*  I always feel bad. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=44.5s)]
*  Yeah, but we're all on the team now. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=46.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=48.3s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=48.86s)]
*  Great. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=49.62s)]
*  That's a good way to play. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=49.94s)]
*  I'm going to tell him that. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=50.739999999999995s)]
*  Um, it's starting to look like one, two for the QBs, which is what you laid out [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=51.9s)]
*  of mock draft 2.0 cam war to Tennessee Sanders to the Browns. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=56.98s)]
*  Can we go through all the breadcrumbs of this Cleveland Brown Sanders? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=62.22s)]
*  Yeah, let's do it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=65.78s)]
*  Please. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=66.34s)]
*  Let's hear it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=67.17999999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=68.1s)]
*  So I mean, you turned me onto the, what is it? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=68.42s)]
*  Bazzana. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=71.74s)]
*  I had to look up who Bazzana was. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=72.42s)]
*  Do you like how I was that deep social media trying to find weird people talking [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=75.17999999999999s)]
*  about this? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=78.97999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I actually did. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=79.78s)]
*  And I'm sitting here, right? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=81.22s)]
*  And I'm watching tape and I'm, it was running back. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=82.78s)]
*  So I'm like, I'm on like the eighth or ninth running back and I've got like 20 [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=85.94s)]
*  more guys to do, and then we're texting about that. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=89.3s)]
*  And I was like, you know what? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=92.74s)]
*  I'm going to stop down for a minute. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=93.89999999999999s)]
*  I thought I was going to take like 10 minutes and look through and see. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=95.53999999999999s)]
*  Then I kind of got into my own little deep dive of art. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=98.78s)]
*  So everyone wants to say, Shador's got a second round grade for a lot of teams. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=102.42s)]
*  I talked to two, two, we'll call them sources, two personnel people, right? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=107.62s)]
*  At the combine who are in that, in the 15 minute interviews with Shador [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=111.26s)]
*  Sanders for teams that are drafting in the top 10 that need a quarterback. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=116.02000000000001s)]
*  And I was surprised that the information that came out was, and I'll kind of [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=120.9s)]
*  paraphrase or summarize it just, we got the vibe after meeting with all these [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=124.38000000000001s)]
*  other players and all the years of doing this, you can sense how important these [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=130.22s)]
*  meetings are for the individual player. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=135.26000000000002s)]
*  When they come in for Shador with us, we didn't get the sense that he cared an [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=136.9s)]
*  awful lot about what we thought of him. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=142.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=144.70000000000002s)]
*  It was almost like he was meeting with his accountant for 15 minutes or something. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=144.98000000000002s)]
*  He was trying to sell them. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=148.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=149.9s)]
*  Like exactly. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=150.22s)]
*  And so, so I'm getting that information and I look at him as a player who in [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=151.5s)]
*  certain systems, certain situations, he's got a chance to really succeed in the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=156.58s)]
*  league, but he's not for everybody. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=160.9s)]
*  He's, he's not a big, strong arm mobile quarterback. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=163.14s)]
*  He's none of those things. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=167.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=168.34s)]
*  And so, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=169.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=169.5s)]
*  Cause the perception is, cause it's Deion's son. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=169.54s)]
*  You just in your head, you're like, Oh, he's got to be an amazing athlete. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=172.74s)]
*  And he's actually a way more traditional quarterback. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=175.01999999999998s)]
*  It's the biggest surprise you'll see. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=177.26s)]
*  And he was talking about, I'm going to, I'm going to run faster than my dad. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=178.82s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know if you're going to, if you were to run a 40, I don't [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=181.14s)]
*  know if you're going to break like four eight. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=183.85999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=185.98s)]
*  So, so you've got all of that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=186.54s)]
*  And so, and now the reports come out from different people in the league. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=188.57999999999998s)]
*  We don't even have a first round grade on them. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=191.18s)]
*  And so I get it because in the teams that are willing to talk or the teams [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=193.26000000000002s)]
*  that don't have interest, right. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=197.46s)]
*  So that's kind of the backdrop. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=199.9s)]
*  And then you, you know, you, you send me some of that stuff. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=201.9s)]
*  And I had heard that Cleveland's a place that he, that he has interest in it, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=204.66s)]
*  but that's a short list. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=208.46s)]
*  And there are some teams that I think those teams that I talked to that he didn't [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=209.62s)]
*  have the, the, you know, overwhelming interviews with are the ones that are on [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=213.06s)]
*  the list where coach prize been telling us since what October, November, that [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=217.46s)]
*  there's going to be some teams that I, that my son is just not going to go play for. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=221.98000000000002s)]
*  So you start to put all these things together. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=226.14000000000001s)]
*  And I just took a minute and I went back and I looked at Kevin Stefanski's history. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=228.3s)]
*  What has made him successful? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=233.10000000000002s)]
*  What he's, what has he been successful with? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=234.66s)]
*  Well, Case Keenum, we want 11 games with as a, as a coach, uh, Kirk [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=236.94s)]
*  Cousins, he won 10 games with a quarterback coach, offensive coordinator, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=244.01999999999998s)]
*  like hands on with those guys. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=248.34s)]
*  And so it got me thinking like the skill sets are the same, not big, not mobile, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=251.06s)]
*  not elite arms, but process quickly. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=256.9s)]
*  That's his secret sauce. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=259.02s)]
*  That's what would you put Flacco in there? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=260.34s)]
*  Flacco modern day Flacco still has a big arm, but not like, you know, the Baltimore [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=263.46s)]
*  Ravens in his prime Flacco and has never been overly mobile. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=268.34s)]
*  So, so yeah, so he's winning games with these guys where pocket passers [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=272.41999999999996s)]
*  don't have these traits, but they all process quickly. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=276.21999999999997s)]
*  They're accurate passers. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=279.41999999999996s)]
*  That's what Chador is. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=280.46s)]
*  And so now I'm looking at it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=281.94s)]
*  I'm saying Cleveland is in purgatory salary cap wise because of the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=282.9s)]
*  Deshaun Watson deal. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=288.14s)]
*  So if I'm Andrew Barry, and I don't have any information that's saying Cleveland [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=289.73999999999995s)]
*  is taking Chador just to make that clear. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=294.14s)]
*  But if I'm Andrew Barry and I'm saying, all right, the salary caps horrible this [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=296.82s)]
*  year, and it's not going to be any better next year, we maybe can get a Russell [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=300.58s)]
*  Wilson or make a trade for Kirk Cousins, but that's just temporary. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=304.94s)]
*  That could help us win some games this year while we're developing a young [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=308.97999999999996s)]
*  quarterback, whether that's for later in his rookie year or for year two. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=312.58s)]
*  But we got to get to year two. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=316.41999999999996s)]
*  Cause if we're drafting this high next year and talking about like Garrett [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=318.38s)]
*  Nussmeyer from LSU or Carson Beck or whoever the quarterbacks are going to be [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=321.38s)]
*  next year, we're probably not the decision makers here in Cleveland. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=325.29999999999995s)]
*  We probably lost our job. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=328.9s)]
*  They have to get to year two, not the Browns. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=330.38s)]
*  Correct. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=332.85999999999996s)]
*  The people making the pick have to get to year two. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=333.34s)]
*  Correct. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=335.5s)]
*  So it makes sense that you're bringing Kenny Pickett as a backup and maybe he [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=336.02s)]
*  does better things than all of us expect. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=340.65999999999997s)]
*  If forced into duty. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=343.34s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=344.41999999999996s)]
*  And so why are they still in the market for these veterans? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=345.7s)]
*  Well, they're not going to cost anything. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=348.7s)]
*  And so they're only up, they weren't in it for Stafford. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=351.21999999999997s)]
*  They're not in it for Aaron Rodgers, but if they can bring in someone to help [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=354.06s)]
*  win games, whether it's the whole year or part of this rookie year for a [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=358.3s)]
*  Chedure Sanders that gives them a shot. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=362.26s)]
*  And then if you have Chedure, there's energy, there's excitement about the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=364.54s)]
*  future and Stefanski is one of the handful of guys in the league that I believe [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=369.02s)]
*  could get the most out of Chedure and actually win a lot of games with. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=373.3s)]
*  So we're checking a bunch of different boxes that make the NFL draft and the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=377.38s)]
*  NBA draft so much fun, right? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=381.34000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=383.18s)]
*  There's desperation. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=383.62s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=385.18s)]
*  You have decision makers like I might not be here in a year. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=385.46s)]
*  What's my, what's my big swing? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=388.85999999999996s)]
*  Well, we have no salary cap space. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=390.58s)]
*  I have the second pick in the draft. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=392.97999999999996s)]
*  Nobody's really going to probably trade up for this. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=394.53999999999996s)]
*  And even if they do, I want to have a quarterback. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=396.82s)]
*  We're going six and 11, seven and 10 next year. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=398.65999999999997s)]
*  See that you have the Miles Garrett piece who was going to leave, get a trade. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=401.29999999999995s)]
*  Something happened. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=406.14s)]
*  He gave that one interview where they asked them, are you comfortable with [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=407.26s)]
*  what's going to happen at quarterback? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=410.82s)]
*  And he's like, oh, yes I am. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=412.09999999999997s)]
*  I was like, oh, what is it? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=413.46s)]
*  Why is he comfortable now? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=414.65999999999997s)]
*  There's no free agent. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=415.7s)]
*  Is that Russell Wilson's not making him comfortable. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=416.5s)]
*  I wouldn't think so. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=418.94s)]
*  Flag that one. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=419.46s)]
*  Then you have Sanders like playing footsie on social media with the [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=420.65999999999997s)]
*  top Indians prospect, which I thought was notable. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=424.38s)]
*  You have the dad who if his son goes second in the NFL draft, it's more money. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=427.74s)]
*  It's more prestige, all that stuff. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=432.74s)]
*  Cleveland. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=435.26s)]
*  And his dad, and his dad, like we can say all the things you want about coach [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=435.78s)]
*  prime and, and, and he's not for everybody. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=439.42s)]
*  And the way he handles things is things are, it's kind of against the establishment. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=442.7s)]
*  So there's obviously always going to be pushback, right? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=446.78s)]
*  But he is dialed into the league and he knows the guys that can help develop his [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=450.58s)]
*  son and at the end of the day, as a father, right, all you want to do is put your [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=456.26s)]
*  children in a position where they have the, they can help them get the best of [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=460.65999999999997s)]
*  what they are, no matter what their career path is. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=465.46s)]
*  And so I think he looks at it and with his connections in the [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=468.82s)]
*  league and his understanding. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=471.74s)]
*  And he looks at it and says, you know what? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=473.5s)]
*  I'm in a good position. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=475.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=476.38s)]
*  He makes more money if he goes picks one, two or three, but also with that. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=477.18s)]
*  And it's kind of unique. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=482.18s)]
*  There are three guys that are running the organization has had coaches that [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=483.74s)]
*  actually can coach quarterbacks. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=488.58000000000004s)]
*  And he's not going number one where Brian Callahan is, but Stefanski is an [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=490.7s)]
*  outstanding quarterback developer and can work with them. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=494.5s)]
*  And Brian Dayball, while he's worked with bigger, you know, Josh [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=498.42s)]
*  Allen's and Jalen Hurts at Alabama. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=501.66s)]
*  He's worked with guys that have different traits. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=504.3s)]
*  Brian Dayball can coach quarterbacks really well. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=506.38s)]
*  So I think the combination of, yeah, he gets more money, but probably just as, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=509.3s)]
*  if not more importantly, I know, I trust where he's going to go and the people [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=514.5s)]
*  who are going to be working with. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=518.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=520.0600000000001s)]
*  And as people listen to this, you're going to be like, well, of course, Simmons [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=520.34s)]
*  wants them to go second because that's going to push out the two best guys. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=522.9s)]
*  You should have seen my comments. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=526.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=527.58s)]
*  I came out and I started talking about this. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=528.02s)]
*  They're like, oh yeah. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=530.22s)]
*  He was got to you. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=531.14s)]
*  Simmons got to you. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=532.9399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=533.9s)]
*  And, and my answer is, yeah, he got me thinking. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=534.66s)]
*  There's no question. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=538.38s)]
*  He got me thinking with some of the social media stuff that I was oblivious [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=539.06s)]
*  to, cause I'm sitting here watching like RJ Harvey, the running back from UCF. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=542.3s)]
*  This started in Cleveland. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=547.22s)]
*  Like there's people that cover the team. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=549.1s)]
*  There's people who follow the team and they're just kind of reading the tea [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=551.1s)]
*  leaves and it's for a lot of the reasons you mentioned. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=554.62s)]
*  It's they really are the only chance for them to get a quarterback who might make [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=557.62s)]
*  it. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=562.58s)]
*  And this is the most fun part of the stretch for the draft where you have 50, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=562.86s)]
*  50 odds, usually with a quarterback this high, right? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=566.86s)]
*  This might be 40, 60, but you start looking hard at the 40. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=569.38s)]
*  I'm like, well, Stefanski, well, we have a good foundation around him. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=573.78s)]
*  Well, we have no chance to get a quarterback. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=578.14s)]
*  What if we can turn them into something like, you know, Rossello has a theory. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=580.9s)]
*  He would just take a quarterback every year in the first round, I think, cause [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=584.74s)]
*  it's like, let's just keep throwing the darts and at some point you hit the [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=587.66s)]
*  balloon. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=591.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=591.46s)]
*  In this case, if you're them, you have no other way to get a quarterback and you [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=592.82s)]
*  are absolutely murdered by the, by the Deshaun thing. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=596.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=600.94s)]
*  The Giants one, that's a little tough for one, cause they're not in the same [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=601.0600000000001s)]
*  salary cap that the Browns are in. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=605.3s)]
*  And they're not, but no, but no one wants to, but Matthew Stafford at the end of [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=607.7s)]
*  the day, he was offered the same. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=611.54s)]
*  And I've even heard reports, maybe like a little bit more to go to New York. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=613.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=616.5s)]
*  But if you're, if you're looking at it and I say, I get two, three years left, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=616.74s)]
*  like, I'm not certain that Joe Shane and more importantly, Brian Dable is going [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=621.0600000000001s)]
*  to be there for two or three years. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=624.26s)]
*  What's the stability? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=626.34s)]
*  About one year. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=627.26s)]
*  They're in the same desperation thing, right? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=628.38s)]
*  They hit on Sanders, they can save the jobs. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=630.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=633.58s)]
*  So that's why for, for the majority of people I've talked to in the league, Bill, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=634.1800000000001s)]
*  it is a later first, maybe early second round grade for, for Chador. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=639.8199999999999s)]
*  But for the teams that are in these very unique situations, Cleveland at two and [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=644.5799999999999s)]
*  the, and the Giants at three, they've, they have circumstances that require them [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=648.9s)]
*  to make decisions that maybe they wouldn't make if they had six years left on their [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=654.38s)]
*  contract, they'd done a lot of winning and they didn't, you know, they, they [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=659.5s)]
*  wanted a quarterback, but they, they didn't need to reinvigorate the fan base. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=664.02s)]
*  And more importantly, show promise towards the future. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=669.14s)]
*  So this isn't Mitch Trubisky either, because this kid comes with real fame [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=672.8199999999999s)]
*  already, people have watched him in college. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=677.6999999999999s)]
*  They've watched him do good things. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=680.34s)]
*  They like his dad. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=682.02s)]
*  He's got some pizzazz where it's like Trubisky. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=683.54s)]
*  It's like, Hey, he's like Darko Milichek basically, Hey on paper, this guy's [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=686.38s)]
*  amazing and there's really no evidence at all. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=692.66s)]
*  And he talked himself into it. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=695.06s)]
*  He didn't have to come back for a second year where defensive coordinators had [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=696.26s)]
*  seen it the first time around. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=699.6999999999999s)]
*  Like Chador, here's the thing that I find interesting. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=701.5s)]
*  First of all, when you watch the tape, he's tough as nails. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=705.9s)]
*  So forget all like the diamonds and the commercials and all that stuff. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=709.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=714.3s)]
*  This guy is an old school throwback, pocket passing, stare down the gun barrel, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=714.54s)]
*  take the hits and pop back up type of quarterback. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=720.74s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=723.1800000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=723.46s)]
*  And the other part is too, it's interesting talking to people in the league. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=724.4200000000001s)]
*  To a T it's like, yeah, primes getting all the media attention and people [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=729.0600000000001s)]
*  think that that's a headache. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=733.94s)]
*  He's not going to be a headache when, when Chador comes here. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=735.5400000000001s)]
*  In fact, and I don't want to go into a lot of the detail and it's speculation [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=739.9000000000001s)]
*  and when one person's thoughts on it versus another's, but Cam Ward's got [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=744.26s)]
*  a father apparently who's been very involved in it. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=750.6600000000001s)]
*  And so there's, there's talk in the league of like, and it's not going [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=753.1800000000001s)]
*  to affect where Cam goes, he's going to be the first pick in the draft. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=756.58s)]
*  But like the, the interesting part to people in the league is like, we'd be a [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=759.4200000000001s)]
*  little bit more worried about the externals with Cam than we are with [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=762.5s)]
*  Chador and coach prime. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=766.6600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=767.94s)]
*  And he's also had a big spotlight on him for the last couple of years. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=768.1800000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=771.5400000000001s)]
*  Then abnormally large for QB. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=771.9s)]
*  There's one other piece. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=774.5400000000001s)]
*  So you're talking about how he didn't do well in a couple of those interviews, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=775.34s)]
*  right? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=778.1800000000001s)]
*  Or the, the vibes were off and it. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=778.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=781.98s)]
*  Nothing was disrespectful. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=782.14s)]
*  No, just like, Hmm. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=783.5400000000001s)]
*  Doesn't seem like he's that interested in coming to our team. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=784.5s)]
*  He knows something that maybe we just don't know. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=787.14s)]
*  And yeah. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=789.3000000000001s)]
*  So there's an NBA version of this. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=790.34s)]
*  They're in the COVID draft when, uh, Lamello ends up going second to Charlotte. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=791.94s)]
*  And the story I always heard was they, and they have to do zoom interviews and [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=797.94s)]
*  it's a, it's like the most fucked up draft process ever. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=803.26s)]
*  And they do the Lamello thing and he's just really off in it and he's distant [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=806.34s)]
*  and just seems like he doesn't really give a shit about the warriors. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=811.1s)]
*  And it affected how they thought about, you know, whether they should take them [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=814.46s)]
*  or not. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=818.38s)]
*  And then it turns out he probably knew he was going, you know, Charlotte, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=818.7800000000001s)]
*  he probably wanted to go there. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=821.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=823.5s)]
*  And you kind of perform what your expectations are for where you want to go. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=823.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=828.4200000000001s)]
*  So if it's a team and I could totally see it, if it's a team you don't really [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=828.74s)]
*  want to go to, you turn in a Tom Cruise and risky business where you're like, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=832.58s)]
*  Hey, I don't really want to go to university of Illinois. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=836.6600000000001s)]
*  I want to go to Princeton. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=839.4200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=840.7s)]
*  So if he has an inkling that he could go second, he knows in Cleveland, like [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=841.4200000000001s)]
*  obviously LeBron was there, like you can become a big star in Cleveland, but I [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=846.4200000000001s)]
*  can see it. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=850.34s)]
*  And it's a good situation because their team wasn't bad last year. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=850.82s)]
*  Like it's not, they're not that far away from being a little more impactful [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=854.26s)]
*  maybe if they had a decent QB. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=858.22s)]
*  No. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=859.94s)]
*  And they, and they need a running back. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=860.42s)]
*  And this is, this just so happens to be the best running back class, maybe in [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=862.14s)]
*  the history of the draft and certainly since 2017. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=865.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=868.18s)]
*  And you know, they're, they're not that far away. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=868.7s)]
*  They're really not. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=872.26s)]
*  And I go through it. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=873.3s)]
*  If I'm Shador and I've got assurances that it could be Cleveland, but if it's [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=875.3s)]
*  not, it's very likely going to be the Giants. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=880.74s)]
*  I think that that probably led to what you were just talking about too. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=884.22s)]
*  And there's no trade up team. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=887.22s)]
*  We don't think cause the Raiders got Gino. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=888.38s)]
*  I don't think that the jets just went in on fields. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=890.98s)]
*  I don't see them trading up anyway. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=893.46s)]
*  And then the same. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=895.1s)]
*  I do hear that the jets, the jets could pull, could, um, throw us a curveball [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=895.86s)]
*  the first night, don't be, let's just get it out here now. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=900.58s)]
*  I'm not saying it's going to happen, but I think there's a little bit of love for [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=903.5s)]
*  a Jackson Darten, that building. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=906.82s)]
*  Oh, it seems like he's the, uh, the bow next of this draft. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=909.5s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=913.82s)]
*  Bonix ends up going what? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=914.42s)]
*  12. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=915.46s)]
*  He went 12. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=916.26s)]
*  Inconceivable. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=916.86s)]
*  He was second round, second round, second round. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=917.7s)]
*  Oh, maybe late first round. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=919.38s)]
*  Then all of a sudden he's 12. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=920.5s)]
*  And if it wasn't Denver, it was probably going to be second round in that place. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=921.66s)]
*  It just Sean Payton fell in love with them. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=926.98s)]
*  Perfect fit. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=929.1s)]
*  And that's how it worked out. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=929.82s)]
*  And listen, Jackson Darten doesn't go seven, which again, maybe let's put a [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=931.62s)]
*  25, 30% chance at most at this point. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=936.66s)]
*  Um, New Orleans is a possibility at nine, but then after that, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=940.5s)]
*  another team that's in salary, cap, hell, and just completely screwed and [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=943.7s)]
*  have to get a quarterback somehow. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=947.6600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=948.98s)]
*  And then everyone's like, well, they brought Derek Cartback. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=949.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=951.3000000000001s)]
*  One more year, but this would actually be a perfect time to get a rookie [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=951.62s)]
*  quarterback as we worked through all the salary stuff, not force them out there [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=956.7s)]
*  for year one. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=960.1800000000001s)]
*  So I think Jackson Dart could be a top 10 pick, but if he's not, then it's like, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=960.74s)]
*  you know, we talk about 21 to Pittsburgh, um, or a team. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=966.0600000000001s)]
*  That's the other thing. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=970.1800000000001s)]
*  Either the Browns or the giants are very likely to take should door, whichever [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=971.3000000000001s)]
*  team doesn't the Browns are picking at 33, which is the first pick of the second [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=976.7s)]
*  round, the giants are picking up one spot after that. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=980.4200000000001s)]
*  I think you'll see one of those teams, whichever one doesn't get a quarterback. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=983.38s)]
*  Why not moving into the first round? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=987.6600000000001s)]
*  Maybe it's to pick 19 to Tampa or 20 to, um, to Denver to try to secure [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=989.7800000000001s)]
*  Jack Jackson, Dart, um, and also to get that fifth year in the NFL. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=996.5s)]
*  There's a fifth year option for the first round player. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1000.74s)]
*  So you want to get that for that extra year of security as an organization. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1003.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, in the McShay report, a very excellent newsletter that everybody [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1006.9s)]
*  should subscribe to pops right into your, it's like, I woke up this morning, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1010.26s)]
*  seven o'clock looking at tax sell, techs, all of a sudden got sold. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1013.66s)]
*  Then your newsletter came. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1017.1s)]
*  I'm like, what a great morning. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1018.1s)]
*  I haven't had that coffee yet. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1019.0600000000001s)]
*  It's kind of nice. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1020.5s)]
*  You have the giants trading up to 19 for Dart. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1022.02s)]
*  You did a fake trade 34 and 65 and a 26 third rounder, the bucks. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1025.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1030.5800000000002s)]
*  For pick number 19. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1030.9s)]
*  So in that scenario, the two quarterbacks go one, two, they take Hunter third. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1032.14s)]
*  And I want to talk about that in a second and then move up and take Dart. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1037.22s)]
*  And now they're like, we've got Dart. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1041.74s)]
*  We've got neighbors. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1043.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1045.46s)]
*  Yo, Travis Hunter, who knows? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1045.66s)]
*  Maybe he'll play both sides of the ball and all of a sudden now there's [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1047.94s)]
*  energy with the giants. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1050.26s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1051.5s)]
*  Let's bring it back to the top four, right? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1054.0600000000002s)]
*  It's a puzzle. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1056.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1057.94s)]
*  And we know one, we've got one of the four pieces of the puzzle with those four picks. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1059.14s)]
*  I feel very strongly like we've got it planted in there. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1063.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1066.94s)]
*  So now figuring out the other three, it's almost like the rest of the draft starts [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1067.7s)]
*  at pick five, like Mason Graham and Tyler Warren and the running backs and all this. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1071.38s)]
*  But the first four picks, it's like, how does this work? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1077.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1079.54s)]
*  Well, and let me stop you one second there. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1079.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1081.98s)]
*  I refuse to read another mock draft that doesn't have those four going in some order. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1082.26s)]
*  I still see drafts from like good places where they're like number four Patriots, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1087.1399999999999s)]
*  Will Campbell, and then Jacksonville takes up dual Carter at five. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1091.26s)]
*  I'm like, I promise you that's not happening. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1094.1399999999999s)]
*  No, no. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1096.4199999999998s)]
*  If Abdul Carter is in four, they're taking up dual Carter. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1096.6999999999998s)]
*  And I put it in there because I wound up with Abdul Carter in the [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1099.54s)]
*  newsletter and the mock draft 2.0. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1102.86s)]
*  I put Abdul Carter in there, but I'm very, very clear to my friends here in New [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1105.3799999999999s)]
*  England, like don't, don't get overly excited because a lot has to, a lot has to happen. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1110.3799999999999s)]
*  So don't buy the Jersey yet. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1115.5400000000002s)]
*  Tell my buddy Jaybug, don't buy it yet. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1117.18s)]
*  Wait till like end of April. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1119.42s)]
*  But if Chedure goes two or three, you can, you can buy two jerseys and get rid of one [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1121.2600000000002s)]
*  of them because it's going to be Hunter or Carter period. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1127.1000000000001s)]
*  But Hunter makes a whiff more sense for the Giants, but I thought you laid it out correctly. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1129.46s)]
*  It makes a little more sense, but if they took Carter, that's, it's not like that's [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1134.38s)]
*  stupid, they would just have an amazing defensive mind. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1138.14s)]
*  I think they've prepared like most good organizations do. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1141.42s)]
*  And I'm saying the Giants have been, but, but organizations are in free agency, are [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1145.3s)]
*  trying to free themselves up to take the best player in the draft. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1151.18s)]
*  The Giants obviously have Kavon Thibodeau and Brian Burns at edge. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1154.98s)]
*  So you look at it and say, it's not a huge needle. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1159.06s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1160.9s)]
*  Like when you get a player like that at the second most important position, you take him. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1161.5800000000002s)]
*  And so if, if it, if it goes where Chedure is number two, they have their choice. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1165.94s)]
*  And so that's a good position to be in. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1172.0600000000002s)]
*  But what if Abdul goes, what if Abdul goes one or two or what Abdul goes to? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1173.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1180.5s)]
*  And they're sitting there three and Hunter's the only guy or if Hunter goes to, and [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1180.9s)]
*  then Abdul sitting there, they've got to make sure that they're covered. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1184.98s)]
*  They, they sign, re-signed Darius Slayton at wide receiver. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1188.42s)]
*  They Paulson Adibo at cornerback. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1191.6200000000001s)]
*  So they're covered, but they're talking about excellence versus just solid players. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1193.7s)]
*  And so, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1199.5s)]
*  well, you put, you put him and neighbors together just from an athlete standpoint. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1200.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1204.94s)]
*  And now you, now you have, and then the opportunity to go get a Jackson [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1205.82s)]
*  dart with that, as you had mentioned. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1210.1000000000001s)]
*  So there's a lot of ways this can play out, but for new England, the only thing you [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1212.1000000000001s)]
*  really truly have to pray for is that should door goes number two or three, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1216.74s)]
*  because then you get either the best or the second best player in this entire [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1223.22s)]
*  draft falling to you at four and that doesn't happen very often. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1228.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1232.86s)]
*  Otherwise you're looking at a trade back and in a trade back, I don't know who's [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1233.06s)]
*  trading up and what you're getting. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1236.98s)]
*  I mean, I told you my dream trade would be the jets move up to four. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1238.5s)]
*  Pats get Garrett Wilson. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1243.54s)]
*  Pats give up their second round pick. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1245.8999999999999s)]
*  So it's basically seven and 39 for, you know, for like whatever the [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1247.6599999999999s)]
*  Pats end up with seven and Garrett Wilson in the deal. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1252.94s)]
*  And I'm like, I'd sign up for that. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1255.1000000000001s)]
*  Why would the jets do that? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1256.9s)]
*  I have no idea, but that's my dad. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1257.9s)]
*  That's where you lose me. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1259.7s)]
*  I mean, yeah, you had me on the show. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1260.74s)]
*  No, I had it. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1262.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1263.14s)]
*  I had it. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1263.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1264.42s)]
*  I can't listen. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1264.78s)]
*  I can't apologize for my dreams. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1265.74s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1267.6200000000001s)]
*  But the thing with the Pats is I'm not, I'm not a big draft for need guy when [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1268.9s)]
*  you're not one guy away from winning the super bowl. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1274.02s)]
*  This Pats thing is going to be like a three year, you know, had completely like, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1276.3400000000001s)]
*  they don't know like we need a left tackle because that way we'll go eight and nine [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1282.02s)]
*  next year, like they just need, they need awesome players and it really doesn't [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1285.62s)]
*  matter what position they are. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1289.1799999999998s)]
*  Well, the problem is though, if you're in New England, if Shador doesn't go, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1290.3s)]
*  right, let's say, let's say Cleveland in the Giants pass and it goes Abdul, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1294.2199999999998s)]
*  uh, Abdul Carter, two Hunter three or vice versa. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1299.82s)]
*  Then it's then now you're, you're in, remember I say, you're in Membo, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1303.6599999999999s)]
*  you're in Membo range. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1307.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1308.3799999999999s)]
*  And Membo's are like taking them three, four spots. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1309.06s)]
*  Too high, but you kind of have to do it. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1311.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1313.4199999999998s)]
*  Membo's are right tackle in college and Kenny kicked to the left side. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1313.6999999999998s)]
*  Are they comfortable with that? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1316.9799999999998s)]
*  And Will Campbell's a pure left tackle, but he's got 32 and a half inch arm. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1318.5s)]
*  Like, and that's concerning when you're using a top 10 pick, you just want it to [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1323.3s)]
*  be clean. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1327.02s)]
*  And so, and then you got Jaylen Walker from Georgia who would do great things. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1328.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1332.86s)]
*  Edge rusher who do great things in Mike Vrabel's defense. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1333.26s)]
*  But again, you're talking about elite and no matter what the draft, Travis [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1335.9399999999998s)]
*  Hunter, Abdul Carter are elite. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1340.86s)]
*  They're in that top tier to then like, it could be one of like six or seven guys [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1343.2199999999998s)]
*  with very similar grades. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1347.6999999999998s)]
*  And now we're, now we are focusing more on the need. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1349.1799999999998s)]
*  No, it's, it's Lombardi's old thing about blue chippers, we call them red [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1352.06s)]
*  chippers and then the guys below that. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1356.6999999999998s)]
*  But you, the teams that usually are around the super bowl sniffing around, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1359.62s)]
*  you look and they have five, six, seven, eight blue chippers. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1364.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1367.6599999999999s)]
*  The Pats only have Gonzalez a drink made right now. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1368.8600000000001s)]
*  Plus the nose tackle they got from the Eagles. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1371.7800000000002s)]
*  What's your blood pressure going to be like when Cleveland and the giants come up [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1373.8600000000001s)]
*  to, you know, to make their, like during that 25, 30. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1379.26s)]
*  Well, don't you think we'll know, we'll know, we'll know with Cleveland and [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1381.98s)]
*  Sanders, right? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1384.8200000000002s)]
*  Like that, that's not going to leak out. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1385.7800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, probably. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1387.8200000000002s)]
*  A lot of people with interest in that. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1388.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1390.7800000000002s)]
*  Don't you think? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1391.42s)]
*  Probably, probably, but still like until you hear the name. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1392.66s)]
*  Cause the only thing that worries me is are the Browns I, and I would do this [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1396.98s)]
*  if I ran a team, like, do you pretend you're drafting Sanders because you want [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1401.18s)]
*  to see if the giants are going to flip out and maybe offer you something to flip [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1405.06s)]
*  picks with you and you wanted Abdul Carter all along. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1408.98s)]
*  Yeah, of course you do. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1412.06s)]
*  I always feel like I'm just going to represent that I'm going to potentially [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1412.98s)]
*  take somebody. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1417.3799999999999s)]
*  The Giants would know, unless you're a team behind trying to, the Giants would [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1418.02s)]
*  know if you're willing to give up that pick, you're not, you're not taking them. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1421.6599999999999s)]
*  But they could say, if you don't swap picks with us, we have somebody that's [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1425.54s)]
*  coming in hard. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1430.54s)]
*  That's the way we might move back to 7-8-9. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1431.62s)]
*  The Jets were a surprise team, the Saints, whoever. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1434.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1436.1799999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1436.46s)]
*  And then, and then you have the Giants are now trying to use all their intel, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1436.8999999999999s)]
*  like find out from our guy and the Jets and how real this is. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1440.7s)]
*  And that's what makes the draft so much fun. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1443.54s)]
*  You're basically all playing poker with each other, but it's some of the worst [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1445.3799999999999s)]
*  poker players who ever lived. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1448.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1450.94s)]
*  So you, the biggest questions are Carter versus the other, the QBs, Carter [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1451.82s)]
*  versus Hunter, just who has more value. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1458.02s)]
*  And that really seems like whoever just needs whatever they do more, but they, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1461.6200000000001s)]
*  they're pretty equal. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1466.02s)]
*  You have Carter above Hunter, but not by it. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1466.7s)]
*  No. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1469.02s)]
*  Shit load, right? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1469.42s)]
*  It's like a hair. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1470.18s)]
*  They're basically identical. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1471.06s)]
*  The tricky part for Hunter is what's the plan, right? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1472.1000000000001s)]
*  And for a team like New England, I've gotten to believe it's, you don't have [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1477.22s)]
*  Drake May and say, yeah, we just drafted this guy for overall generational talent. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1481.34s)]
*  He's going to be a nickel corner as a rookie and eventually our starting corner. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1486.74s)]
*  You might get 20 plays with them on offense. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1490.4199999999998s)]
*  It's just not going to happen. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1492.5s)]
*  So everyone is talking about the, the moonlighting where you'd like to play [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1493.4199999999998s)]
*  him at corner, cause that's the harder position in terms of developing and the [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1498.1s)]
*  technique and being part of it, part of 11 there, whereas wide receivers, a [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1501.78s)]
*  little bit more ISO one, it's kind of like an NBA thing, you know? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1506.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1510.4199999999998s)]
*  A lot of one-on-one stuff for New England. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1510.8200000000002s)]
*  I can't imagine that would be the case. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1513.8600000000001s)]
*  I think it would be your full-time receiver. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1515.26s)]
*  We've got our biggest asset in this entire organization is Drake May. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1517.3400000000001s)]
*  And so we've got to, we've got to assist that. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1521.3400000000001s)]
*  And this is also our best chance to get a number one receiver. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1523.7s)]
*  Cause we struck out trying to get all these different guys. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1526.38s)]
*  Now you're looking at Stefan Diggs and Brandon IU, people are coming off major [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1529.5s)]
*  injuries, it gets a little, and it's a receiver draft that sucks. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1533.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1537.5800000000002s)]
*  So it depends on the team, but I'll say this. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1537.9s)]
*  I think Travis Hunter is more advanced as a wide receiver right now. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1541.5400000000002s)]
*  I think Travis Hunter can be Garrett Wilson and with maybe like a touch [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1545.18s)]
*  more juice after the catch, like. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1549.74s)]
*  So I would have no problem with him being a 50 snap a game, offensive player [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1552.5s)]
*  and 25, you know, third downs, red zone, that kind of stuff on defense. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1557.3400000000001s)]
*  If you can, if you can manage all that. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1561.8200000000002s)]
*  It sounds like such a fun wrinkle for whoever gets him. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1563.98s)]
*  Where if you play him at receiver, but he's also like your dime back. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1567.1799999999998s)]
*  And it's just like, he's in now. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1570.9399999999998s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1572.1s)]
*  He picked one off. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1572.62s)]
*  Like just, it's this rate of being on the field to return a puncture kick. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1573.4199999999998s)]
*  Do you remember like, or when he would line up at receiver, it was like so exciting. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1578.6999999999998s)]
*  I was like, Oh my God, are they going to throw it to him? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1582.4199999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1584.58s)]
*  So that would be cool. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1584.82s)]

*  Um, then the draft really starts at five. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1682.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1685.3799999999999s)]
*  And you had Mason Graham going to the Jags and mock draft 2.0. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1685.98s)]
*  Um, yeah, it makes a lot of sense. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1689.6599999999999s)]
*  The running backs are fascinating to me too, though. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1691.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1694.26s)]
*  So I was going to say that the boys to stay kid at six to the Raiders, but then [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1694.58s)]
*  you also love Hampton and we could have two running backs in the top 12, even [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1699.22s)]
*  though one of the only things we've learned about the draft is don't take [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1702.78s)]
*  running backs that high, it's, it's a disposable position. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1706.3799999999999s)]
*  Like I was looking at the 2016 draft in the NFL. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1710.1s)]
*  Don't ask why. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1713.18s)]
*  And like everybody in that draft seems so old now, like Zeke Elliot's in it. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1714.7s)]
*  2016 draft is like not that long ago. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1718.54s)]
*  Like Jaylen Brown was in the 2016 draft and he's just hitting the [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1720.94s)]
*  prime of his career and Zeke Elliot seems like he's 48. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1725.18s)]
*  Um, so you think about that with running backs and it's like, all right, so [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1729.3s)]
*  you're, I'm going to draft somebody that I have for six years. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1733.02s)]
*  I get Mason Graham. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1736.26s)]
*  He might play till he's 36. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1738.46s)]
*  You might, he might have two giant contracts. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1741.14s)]
*  I just, Cam Hayward's one at 36 now. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1743.9s)]
*  So, right. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1746.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1747.1s)]
*  So if you're taking a running back, that guy that high, you better think it's [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1747.3s)]
*  like, this is Saquon Barkley, B. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1750.66s)]
*  Sean Robinson for each of those teams. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1752.78s)]
*  Do you look at the Raiders and like some of their other position, like wide [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1755.06s)]
*  receiver, there's no receiver to draft that high, some of the other position, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1758.4199999999998s)]
*  cornerback, like John A. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1761.62s)]
*  Barron from Texas, but it's not like, we're not talking about, you know, one of [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1762.98s)]
*  those like elite, elite corners. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1767.34s)]
*  Um, you look at what Pete Carroll has had and he's not necessarily, you [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1769.94s)]
*  know, going to be the, it depends on what his role winds up being, but Tom Brady [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1775.5s)]
*  is going to play a big part in all of this too, but from a, from the standpoint [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1780.34s)]
*  of how they want to build it, you want to have a great defense. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1785.1399999999999s)]
*  They want to recapture some of the Legion of doom stuff. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1787.66s)]
*  They want to have a, you know, a running back, like a Marshawn Lynch, who, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1790.94s)]
*  who gave you a big banger, protect the ball, let the defense take care of a lot [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1795.9s)]
*  of the business on the field. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1801.5s)]
*  And that's what Chinti is in terms of an every down back. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1802.94s)]
*  He, the miss tackles forced and like, he's just, he's a special back. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1806.7s)]
*  So that it makes sense for that organization and for that pick where they [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1811.74s)]
*  are, cause it's not like they're passing on this elite pass rusher or corner or [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1815.46s)]
*  wide receiver that they, that they shouldn't for a running back. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1819.3400000000001s)]
*  And then for Chicago, they handle their business so well in free agents, three [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1822.38s)]
*  offensive linemen that they're protecting their quarterback. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1828.18s)]
*  They, they could go tackle with that spot if Will Campbell's still there. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1831.1000000000001s)]
*  But I also, I have concerns enough with drafting at 32 and a half inch arm tackle [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1836.14s)]
*  in the top 10, and if we bring in a running back to go with Deandre Swift, how [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1841.7s)]
*  much more are we protecting our quarterback by having two backs? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1847.54s)]
*  And so if one goes down, we still have a top shelf back. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1851.42s)]
*  If both are in there, they're keeping each other fresh. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1854.06s)]
*  We can run the football. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1856.8999999999999s)]
*  We can take some pressure. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1857.98s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1858.86s)]
*  And we saw what Ben Johnson did with Jameer Gibbs and how quickly that, that [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1859.82s)]
*  offense went from, you know, 90 to a hundred, but that one player really. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1865.06s)]
*  So Will Campbell, if Will Campbell had 34 inch arms, he'd be the fourth pick in the draft. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1871.6599999999999s)]
*  Could be. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1877.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1878.1s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1879.22s)]
*  There's only three starting tackles in the league at the end of the year [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1881.18s)]
*  with sub 33 inch arms. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1884.74s)]
*  So you're, you're playing a, it's kind of, Per Sells used to say, we don't, we [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1888.02s)]
*  don't want a roster full of exceptions, you know, so that part's concerning. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1893.34s)]
*  If you were GM, would you ever take a running back in the top 12? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1898.26s)]
*  No. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1901.26s)]
*  I don't think I would either. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1902.7s)]
*  Especially not this year when I'm looking at guys like Quinchon [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1903.5800000000002s)]
*  Judkins from Ohio state and Kam Skataboos. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1907.22s)]
*  I take his tape. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1910.98s)]
*  I liked even more than I thought after watching the awesome things he did this season. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1911.9s)]
*  That's my dream scenario for the third round for the Pats. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1915.8600000000001s)]
*  I don't know that he's going to get there. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1918.9s)]
*  He might not, but, but even if not, you got RJ Harvey from UCF. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1921.9s)]
*  You've got DJ Giddens from KC. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1925.5400000000002s)]
*  You know this though, when there's too many guys start dropping because nobody [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1927.3s)]
*  ends up taking like even think about last year with the wide receivers that got so [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1931.86s)]
*  stupid and the Pats ended up with the 10th guy in the first 35 picks who was a receiver. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1935.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1940.46s)]
*  You know, I think there's a, they know all of a sudden Cooper goes to the Eagles at [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1940.86s)]
*  39 and he's the third best defensive back on the board. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1945.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1948.6599999999999s)]
*  I just feel like when there's a glut, it really fucks things up. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1949.3s)]
*  And so, and sometimes though, when you look at it and say, well, I can get those [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1952.4199999999998s)]
*  guys later, sometimes it's like, hold, hold, you know, and then all of a sudden [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1956.86s)]
*  one goes and there will be this, this run. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1962.34s)]
*  But I think everyone's going to kind of wait to see where the dominoes start to [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1965.4599999999998s)]
*  fall before they jump in because no one wants to draft a, no one wants to draft [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1968.6599999999999s)]
*  the running back over some of these other premium positions, even if you're [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1973.02s)]
*  talking about pick 40, they'd rather wait. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1975.9799999999998s)]
*  But I would say the, the, the Gibbs and the success Detroit had with him as a [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1978.78s)]
*  weapon would make people think like, ah, maybe in the 12th to 15 range. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1982.54s)]
*  I always look with the draft, you know, and I'm starting, I'm already starting [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1986.5400000000002s)]
*  to think about NFL over unders and the wind totals and can somebody get like [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1990.26s)]
*  when the Eagles got Jaylen Carter that year, it's like, Oh, that's that getting [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1994.9s)]
*  that guy at nine, Jesus, like that, that might affect. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=1999.1000000000001s)]
*  And when you look at the teams that are picking the first 15, the one that jumped [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2002.3000000000002s)]
*  out to me was the team you mentioned, the bears, and I have no idea if they're going [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2008.8600000000001s)]
*  to be good and they're in a brutal division and who knows with Caleb, but [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2012.18s)]
*  they, they spent a lot of money. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2015.78s)]
*  They have the QB on the rookie scale. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2017.26s)]
*  And then if they just crushed the 10th pick somehow and got somebody awesome, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2019.8999999999999s)]
*  then you just have to start thinking like, ah, look at this, like that [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2025.34s)]
*  Tyler Warren, the tight end, I don't know where he's going to go. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2028.5s)]
*  He could go five. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2030.98s)]
*  He could go 12, but like, if they got him at 10, that's somebody that could play [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2031.7s)]
*  right away and be, you know, potentially like an impact dude right away. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2036.74s)]
*  So that was the team I was looking at. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2041.54s)]
*  And then the only other one was, uh, was Atlanta, just cause I think Atlanta [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2043.54s)]
*  with Penix and they have some talent, the division sucks, like if they are able [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2047.86s)]
*  to nail that pick, that could be a good one too. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2052.38s)]
*  Going back to the bears, it's kind of what I said earlier, like the good [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2055.42s)]
*  teams, they, they plug all the holes so that they can pick, pick the best player [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2059.42s)]
*  available, they do have a luxury pick. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2064.22s)]
*  And you would say, well, how do the bears have a luxury pick? [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2066.62s)]
*  Well, that would be in it to a certain degree, a luxury pick, but [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2068.42s)]
*  it fits what they want to do. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2071.86s)]
*  But the other part of it is maybe you say to 10 and you draft an offensive [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2073.58s)]
*  tackle, or maybe you draft an edge rusher, like a Mike Kell Williams from [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2078.46s)]
*  Georgia, because they are picking it. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2082.42s)]
*  I've got it right here. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2084.94s)]
*  30, 39 and 41 in the second round. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2085.9s)]
*  And so if I, I love Omarion Hampton from UNC at running back, but what if I just [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2089.7799999999997s)]
*  take a stab at one of these pass rushers and look at what like the Eagles. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2095.58s)]
*  What if I load up on my D? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2099.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2100.66s)]
*  Load up on my D, go get cam Scataboo, go get Quinn Sean, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2101.02s)]
*  Judkins, one of those guys at 39. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2105.02s)]
*  I can still draft an offensive lineman or defensive player with that 41st pick. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2107.02s)]
*  So there's different ways to look at all of this. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2111.62s)]
*  And that's why I think it's going to be fascinating. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2114.9s)]
*  We, we're going to see at least two running backs in the first round. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2116.3s)]
*  I think three, I don't know that we're going to see two in the top 10, but we [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2119.38s)]
*  can't believe that, you know, that's what with TMAC, I wonder like, with this is [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2122.98s)]
*  the reverse of a glut when there's nobody at a position, he's the only probably [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2127.8999999999996s)]
*  first down first round graded wide receivers. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2132.14s)]
*  One of the only two that you could even see going in there and somebody just [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2134.74s)]
*  needs a receiver and you get people in our office like, ah, fuck it. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2137.74s)]
*  We need a receiver. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2140.22s)]
*  And all of a sudden he's going 11th, you know, cause we see that version of the [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2141.06s)]
*  draft too, I just say, wow, you're taking them here. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2144.62s)]
*  I think everyone wants to be so quick to look at the highlights and the spectacular [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2148.2999999999997s)]
*  plays and they are spectacular. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2152.02s)]
*  And then they want to look at his size and then they want to look at the report [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2153.58s)]
*  from Schultz was it that where he ran a four, four, eight, I talked to some [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2157.06s)]
*  scouts, they had closer to four, four, five, somewhere in that range, regardless. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2161.02s)]
*  Um, I, I don't see the dog in him and I don't see the refinement and Drake London [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2166.18s)]
*  wasn't overly refined and he needed a year before he could be a thousand plus [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2173.38s)]
*  yard receiver, but that's the comp, right? [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2176.46s)]
*  Tall, just acrobatic type of guy, but they're yes, the shades of, but they're [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2178.5s)]
*  not, they're not the same player. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2186.02s)]
*  So does somebody look better if there's not, if there's not a lot of competition [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2187.98s)]
*  in a draft and then they start to look like the hottest girl at the bar? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2192.1s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2195.9s)]
*  And he will go, I mean, he could go as high as Dallas at 12, let's say. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2196.5s)]
*  Uh, but I, I had him going later in the first round. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2201.94s)]
*  I had him go into the, um, to the Ravens kind of at that point, best player [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2204.54s)]
*  available, they can use another receiver. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2208.7s)]
*  Probably go somewhere in between that range when it's all said and done. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2210.98s)]
*  But I'm betting on Matthew Golden from Texas. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2214.46s)]
*  If you need a receiver, like that's why I gave you Dallas. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2216.98s)]
*  I've got two and then a Mecca Ibuka could be the third that sneaks in from Ohio [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2219.9s)]
*  State. We'll see how he runs it as pro day, but he would be the third that I [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2223.58s)]
*  think has a good chance to go. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2226.18s)]
*  All right. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2228.14s)]
*  Two more questions. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2228.38s)]
*  Second, I'll ask him. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2229.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2230.82s)]
*  If you're not getting the receiver that first pick at 38 for New England, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2232.06s)]
*  Jayden Higgins from Iowa State do a little work on him. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2235.86s)]
*  I've watched some YouTube on him. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2240.38s)]
*  They're looking for, they're looking for a physical receiver. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2242.5800000000004s)]
*  Phil little burned after poke last year in the, in the thirties with the receiver. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2245.6200000000003s)]
*  I'm, I'm, I'm hurt. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2248.1400000000003s)]
*  My guard's up. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2249.1000000000004s)]
*  I know, but I'm just saying he's a name that fits what they're looking for. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2250.1800000000003s)]
*  Second, I'll ask question. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2254.34s)]
*  Who is the holy shit this guy's going here? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2256.26s)]
*  Top 15 guy. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2259.78s)]
*  If you had to guess the guy who just goes 10, 11 spots higher than you ever [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2261.38s)]
*  could imagine last year would have been Bo Nicks. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2266.42s)]
*  Like if we were talking about that draft five weeks for the draft, they're like, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2268.1800000000003s)]
*  and you said Bo Nicks is going to go 12. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2271.7000000000003s)]
*  I would have been like, what? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2273.5s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2274.82s)]
*  He's not going 12. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2275.7000000000003s)]
*  Who is the, that's insane guy. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2276.86s)]
*  I think Jackson Dart could be. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2279.26s)]
*  I'm just looking at it right now. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2281.3s)]
*  Um, is there a weird left tackle? [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2283.7000000000003s)]
*  Like maybe on paper guy that we're not, that could be like Membo already. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2286.46s)]
*  I'll give you a guy. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2292.3s)]
*  Everyone coming out of the combine. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2294.02s)]
*  Nikki Minwari, right from South Carolina. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2296.26s)]
*  Really good player. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2298.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2300.06s)]
*  I don't think an elite player yet. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2300.5s)]
*  I think he's still getting there. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2302.78s)]
*  I think you used in the right scheme. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2304.0600000000004s)]
*  I'd love to see him, um, with, I would say. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2306.2200000000003s)]
*  Trying to think of Seattle would be a perfect spot, right? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2312.54s)]
*  McDonald the way he, he, what he did Baltimore Hamilton. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2315.86s)]
*  I could see that being a really good marriage, but even worry was, was [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2320.82s)]
*  like almost six, four, 220 pounds. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2324.6600000000003s)]
*  His combination of like size 40 times, which was four, four flat and vertical [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2327.38s)]
*  broad jump, it had never been done in the history of the combo. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2332.14s)]
*  Like he's that special of an athlete. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2335.7799999999997s)]
*  It was awesome to watch. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2337.14s)]
*  I still think the other safety who ran after him and ran a pedestrian time [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2339.94s)]
*  and didn't jump like him. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2344.86s)]
*  And I think Malachi starts from Georgia. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2346.02s)]
*  Could wind up being a top 15 pick ahead of Eman worrying. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2347.98s)]
*  I think that would surprise people right now. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2351.02s)]
*  Last question. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2353.62s)]
*  Rossello stretches for a half hour. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2354.78s)]
*  Goes out to Manhattan and tries to run the 40, but he's stretched. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2358.54s)]
*  He's limber and he's ready. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2364.58s)]
*  And we have scouts there and a stopwatch. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2366.06s)]
*  What is Rossello running right now in the 40? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2368.06s)]
*  We haven't talked about this publicly, but what there's no better place to do it. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2370.86s)]
*  I texted Rossello the other day with the old, the old line of, um, of, uh, town, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2374.62s)]
*  the town, the movie, you know, I can't tell you what we're going to do. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2380.3s)]
*  You can't, you can't, you know, you can't. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2383.86s)]
*  And I said, I, my, your answer needs to be who's, whose car are we going to take? [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2387.06s)]
*  And that was in regards to, I wanted, I want to take over his house for the third [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2393.46s)]
*  day at the draft and do a live stream from there. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2397.82s)]
*  Sounds great. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2401.02s)]
*  So this was, so we're announcing that right now without permission, but I [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2401.94s)]
*  figured who's going to yell at me. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2405.2200000000003s)]
*  You right. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2407.1400000000003s)]
*  Um, but I, I would love to do, to do that as part of the day three of the [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2407.94s)]
*  draft to get Rossello to run. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2412.78s)]
*  I'm going to guess. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2414.46s)]
*  I mean, he's really, he's got a lot of muscle right now, which I think would [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2416.1800000000003s)]
*  hurt for the speed, but it also may help. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2420.86s)]
*  Maybe he's in great shape. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2423.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2424.3s)]
*  493. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2426.2200000000003s)]
*  493. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2427.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2429.38s)]
*  So you're under five. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2429.94s)]
*  He's a friend. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2433.7000000000003s)]
*  That's fair. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2435.6600000000003s)]
*  That was really, really nice of you. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2436.0600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I thought so. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2437.5s)]
*  So publicly you'll go 493. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2438.26s)]
*  I would be more interested in like the three cone or the short shuttle, the [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2440.46s)]
*  lateral agility with all that weightlifting. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2443.58s)]
*  I just can't see that, that ending. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2446.22s)]
*  Well, what, what weightlifting out of all those things they do in that, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2447.94s)]
*  what would he crush? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2451.66s)]
*  The bench press. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2452.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2454.02s)]
*  The bed's a huge bench press. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2454.82s)]
*  That's what the teams are talking about after like Jesus Rossello bench 580. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2456.22s)]
*  But I don't see him as a fullback. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2461.74s)]
*  So I'm trying to figure out where we're going to roll him. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2463.38s)]
*  Oh, you see him like a, like a, what was that guy in the Niners? [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2465.66s)]
*  You check. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2469.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2469.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2470.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2471.38s)]
*  Like a guy Belichick would have taken in 2007, just like I just want him for special [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2472.18s)]
*  teams. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2476.18s)]
*  Special team effort. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2476.54s)]
*  I like his attitude. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2477.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2478.66s)]
*  Kind of like that celebrity basketball game he played and I'll never forget that. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2479.22s)]
*  Oh, he's still mad about it. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2483.2999999999997s)]
*  We'll talk about it all the time. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2484.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2485.7s)]
*  All right. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2485.86s)]
*  McShea subscribe to his newsletter. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-huTzyjbZc&t=2485.98s)]
