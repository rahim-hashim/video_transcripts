# Million-Dollar Picks Week 2 With Joe House  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3hyqNLScEs)
*  All right.
*  Joe houses here.
*  We're about to do million dollar picks.
*  We almost had an awesome week last week and then, uh, the jets let us down, but
*  we, we finished four and two last week.
*  We won $364,000 of fake money.
*  We were four and one on the straight ups.
*  We lost our teas and most importantly, I want our argue pick, which was charges
*  raider, so we're gonna do an argued pick.
*  Congrats.
*  We do.
*  We too is always scary overreactions.
*  Uh, a false sense of security or a false sense of this team is way worse than, and
*  then it turns out they're not that bad.
*  So we've been talking a lot about bets we like this week and unfortunately there's
*  been more disagreements than usual.
*  Thank God it's my podcast and I can overrule us.
*  I, I, the thing we seem the most excited about is the chargers just to beat the
*  absolutely terrible Carolina Panthers.
*  Um, and there's a bet on Fandel where it's chargers first half charges for the game
*  is minus one 30, but we were looking at that, but I'm going to go through some of
*  the games that I like and you could either poo poo them throw in, I'll do two.
*  Then you do one and we can just go back and forth.
*  I'm just happy to be back.
*  So yeah, you get, you earned another week because we won.
*  Thank God.
*  So Steelers Broncos Steelers minus two and app at Denver.
*  And I love the Steelers.
*  I'm continuing the back to Steelers.
*  I love their defense.
*  Now it's like, well, Kirk Cousins couldn't move.
*  That's why I thought their defense was awesome in that game.
*  Denver last week in Seattle, 67 plays for 231 yards.
*  Bonus was awful.
*  Yes.
*  Why wouldn't Pittsburgh's defense just eat him up this week?
*  Explain it to me.
*  It's not picked Pittsburgh's defense that I'm worried about.
*  Um, cause I do think that they'll travel.
*  They'll be ferocious.
*  It's the offense, right?
*  We know, no touchdowns.
*  So we're still trying to find a touchdown with Pittsburgh and it's
*  just situationally a hard thing.
*  A second consecutive road game at the beginning of the season, flying
*  out to the high altitude and Denver started off last year, oh, and to
*  never lost to Washington and their home opener last year.
*  So I think Sean Payton is like, you know, point of emphasis.
*  Let's try and not do that again.
*  And the reason that I'm feeling not incredible about Pittsburgh is I
*  thought that Denver defense was something against Seattle.
*  I mean, they opened the game with a sack and an interception and two
*  effing safeties in the first half and Denver was winning at halftime.
*  So for me, I'm, I'm not at that inclined to jump back in.
*  There's a big difference between Tomlin as a dog and Tomlin as a road favorite.
*  So I'm just kind of like feeling squeamish about it.
*  So the only thing with Denver's defense, for some reason,
*  Seattle just couldn't block.
*  Well, they have one of the worst offensive lines.
*  Yeah.
*  I was texting with Mina and Danny Kelly and they were just having a hard attack
*  in the first half about how bad the blocking was.
*  So Denver's defense might actually not even be that good.
*  It might've just been in a Seattle.
*  We'll know with the Seattle offensive line against the Pats this week.
*  I, to me, this is an only fields can screw this up at Lombardi made
*  the key point before you came on.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  I know you don't have to get Lombardi was like, watch how
*  they used fields in that first game.
*  He never threw the ball over the middle.
*  They never wanted to put him.
*  Everything was to the sides or deep or him scrambling.
*  Like I think, I actually think the Steelers are pretty well coached and have kind
*  of figured out what they can do and not do with him.
*  Um, I still like it.
*  Steelers minus two and a half.
*  I have it marked down.
*  I'll talk you into it.
*  It's fine.
*  Jaguars Browns is a bet against Deshaun Watson.
*  And a bet on Jacksonville's defense that maybe actually is good.
*  They were good for two and a half quarters gave up one long tie replay,
*  one waddle play, but for the most part, uh, I thought they were pretty good.
*  I mean, they only gave up 20 points.
*  Um, no, no joke.
*  Go for Cleveland.
*  Cleveland's offensive line is still banged up.
*  My question is if ETN doesn't fumble and Jacksonville goes up 24 seven,
*  they're about to win.
*  Is this line like five and a half?
*  Well, that, that would be crazy.
*  The look ahead was Jacksonville by one.
*  And I'm saying Jacksonville kills Miami and gets killed by Dallas.
*  This line's Jacksonville by six.
*  I don't, I mean, that would be crazy talk.
*  If you, I went through all of the lines and looked for the discrepancies
*  between the look ahead for week two, because, you know, just in general,
*  week two, you don't play favorites, right?
*  Favorites hit like 40 some percent of the time in, in week two.
*  So stay away from favorites.
*  And the other thing is, you know, you're looking for teams that were outright
*  favorites in week one who are now in week two, um, you know, th there is a nice
*  bounce back angle in terms of against the spread, those hit at about a 60% clip.
*  But I don't like, um, you know, I didn't see anything from Jacksonville that
*  warranted the inflation on the line.
*  That is a purely a function.
*  That's exactly it.
*  It's a, it's a, it's a Deshawn premium.
*  You got to pay it to Sean premium.
*  How about this?
*  I'm happy to pay it.
*  I think his career is over.
*  Well, I don't think he's a functional starting quarterback anymore.
*  It may be, and I'm not going to make the argument supporting him.
*  What I will say is that there was a big difference between the first half and
*  second half of that game in terms of, you know, him looking mildly functional.
*  He did hit a Amari Cooper in the hands with a 40 yard pass for a touchdown
*  that Amari Cooper did drop.
*  The Browns did have four drops.
*  He's probably so shocked.
*  He got hit in the hands of the past.
*  He probably didn't know how to react.
*  No argument, but I mean, I'm still invested in the Cleveland defense.
*  And I do think, you know, they're good.
*  They're the Jacksonville offensive line has a little bit of a
*  rotating cast of characters.
*  And if Cleveland puts defense on, on Trevor Lawrence, you know, the splits for
*  him under duress and not under duress are not good.
*  So I just don't love like all the extra, the two extra points.
*  How about the splits of Cleveland's defense on the road versus
*  Cleveland's defense at home?
*  Then the other question is, you know, Cleveland, it's a must win, but it's
*  also, if they lose, then it probably gives them an excuse to, to dump to Sean and.
*  You know, put them on the bench and try one of the other guys.
*  Jacksonville, if they lose this game, they'd be owing to going into
*  at Buffalo on a Monday night at Houston.
*  It's weirdly a must win, even though it's the Sean Watson.
*  Like this is a, Hey, if we're good, we got to take care of business.
*  So for me, I thought, I thought Jacksonville was a playoff team.
*  I still think they have the talent to be there and if they can't win a game like
*  this, then I was dead wrong and I'm just not willing to think I'm wrong.
*  So this ties into the third game Colts Packers Colts minus three in
*  Green Bay with Malik Willis.
*  And we're going to argue about Malik Willis in a second.
*  I get the best defense in either league against Bo Nix.
*  Sorry, Kyle.
*  I get a Jaguars defense at home that seems pretty good in hot weather against
*  the Sean Watson, his career is about to be over.
*  And then I get to bet against Malik Willis.
*  And I'm just like, just strip all this stuff away.
*  And it's like, I get to do those three things.
*  I get to do the three things.
*  What are the odds I can't go at least two and one with those three, with
*  those three thoughts in my head?
*  I just want to urge caution because what you've done after you admirably
*  presented me with a full slate of week one underdogs, you've now shown up for
*  week two, the week where you don't play favorites and immediately put three
*  favorites on the table, including one where the look ahead line was, you know,
*  you're doing a great conciliary job.
*  Yeah, that's what I'm here for.
*  I'm here for the look ahead line.
*  I'm here for the conciliary job.
*  Yeah, that's what I'm here for.
*  Malik Wilson, Malik Willis.
*  Maybe you should change his name.
*  Same difference.
*  Doesn't matter.
*  Three starts, 48 points, 11 passing first downs, got sacked 10 times, 276 total
*  pass yards, zero touchdowns, three picks.
*  Just got given away for our seventh round pick.
*  I don't know what they're doing.
*  It almost, the only thing that worries me about this is if they think Jordan
*  Love can actually play and they're rope-a-doping us.
*  Cause they haven't, they haven't said he's out.
*  He's like doubtful, questionable.
*  And are we allowed to do a million dollar picks?
*  Like if Jordan Love plays, the bet's scratched.
*  Well, it's your-
*  I guess it's my gimmick.
*  I guess I can do what I want.
*  I just am prepared to talk you out of it either way.
*  I just-
*  Why? Talk me out of it.
*  Let's hear it.
*  Well, because either we believe in LaFleur, who starts off the season on fire, his
*  record against the spread and straight up in the first three weeks, since he's
*  been the head coach, is stellar.
*  And you know, you could say, well, this is because the guys had, you know, he
*  went, he went from Aaron Rodgers to, to, to Jordan Love and yeah, like, you know,
*  two pretty great quarterback situations.
*  And we're going to put that all to the test.
*  But the thing to me is, I like the way that Green Bay established the
*  run against Philadelphia.
*  And I think that Philadelphia's run defense is superior to the Colts because
*  Joe Mixon, who hasn't run for 160 yards since what, high school, came out with
*  Houston and ran for 160 yards against this Colts defense.
*  Can I give you a counter on that?
*  Please go ahead.
*  Cause I said this to Lombardi.
*  Is it possible Houston's offense is really well-rounded and awesome?
*  And Indianapolis was like, we have to give up something.
*  We don't want to give up deep passes and have Straub just annihilate us all over
*  the field.
*  Let's see if Joe Mixon can run for 160 yards.
*  Cause I think that was the philosophy.
*  I also don't think Indianapolis' defense is that good, but
*  well, it might be awesome.
*  Here's an element to it, right?
*  The Colts defense was on the football field for more than 35 minutes.
*  Like, I mean, right around 35 minutes.
*  76 plays to 43, I think.
*  Something like that.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause the other time the Colts got the ball and they were just, Richardson
*  had 350-yard plays, so the drives were faster.
*  Yep.
*  Yep.
*  Yep.
*  Yep.
*  So you have a tired defense on the road.
*  Are you really telling me you don't want me to bet against Malik Willis?
*  Like, that's honestly what you're telling me?
*  When we were comparing notes, you thought it was a line.
*  They brought him out to throw a Hail Mary and he didn't even get the Hail Mary off.
*  It was the best thing ever.
*  There's no scenario under which I'm going to sit here and advocate for Malik Willis.
*  I honestly think that LaFleur is going to keep the ball out of his hands.
*  He is going to be standing in the quarterback position.
*  You know why the Packers ran the ball well against Philly?
*  Cause Jordan Love was their quarterback and they had to play with all the receivers,
*  worry about them, and they had to give up something.
*  It's a great point.
*  Now you don't have to worry about anybody.
*  Well, I accept-
*  Listen, you're not taking Malik Willis week away from me.
*  I want to bet against Malik Willis and I'm doing it.
*  Oh, I'm telling you, it's too many points.
*  This is a miracle line.
*  It's cold minus three.
*  No, I don't like it.
*  It's a field goal.
*  It's too much.
*  I would be fine with it.
*  Too much? How much lower do you want it?
*  What if it's one?
*  It's like, oh, now that's a fair price.
*  One and a half or two would be fine.
*  Six points.
*  A six point difference for Love.
*  That's all.
*  Not doing three.
*  You're just being a puss.
*  That's really what you're being.
*  I'm here to be your consigliere.
*  I just want to urge caution.
*  It's the most obvious game on the table.
*  Like the most obvious game on the table last week.
*  And we saw how that went.
*  What is the case for supporting Green Bay and Malik Willis?
*  Nobody can make it.
*  You just made the case.
*  You said Green Bay's going to-
*  that Indies run defense is bad.
*  Green Bay's going to run the ball.
*  The floor is a good coach.
*  Lambeau Field, Anthony Richardson and Green Bay.
*  There's a case.
*  I'm trying.
*  I just don't think people remember how bad Malik Willis was.
*  It's like, oh, they have a backup.
*  It'll be fine.
*  It's like, no, this is way worse than a backup.
*  Chargers-
*  He also won't be blown away by seeing the Colts because while he was on the Titans,
*  he saw the Colts a couple of few times.
*  Right?
*  It's not like, oh, this is not going to be the-
*  you know, it's still a Gus Bradley defense.
*  Cover three all day long.
*  Chargers-Panthers.
*  There's a bet on Fandel we like with that minus 130 first half game that I just want to mark.
*  Carolina lost Brown for the year, their best guy on the defensive line.
*  Bryce Young's in absolute shambles.
*  Harbaugh against Dave Canales.
*  Palmer's hurt for the Chargers, which was where's me little.
*  Lombardi was pointing out how Herbert just didn't look good in game one.
*  Chargers next to is at Pittsburgh home KC.
*  So this is a little bit of a must win, but the Carolina thing.
*  It's almost bad to play at home if you're Carolina.
*  When the fans are this upset about the Bryce Young trade, how bad Bryce Young's
*  look, the owner, just the vibes.
*  I would, I would rather be on the road if I was them, but, uh, this just feels like
*  a Harbaugh figures it out game.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm glad we're talking about this game in the manner we're talking about it, because,
*  um, if we were talking about the points, I wouldn't, I wouldn't want to do it.
*  I try, I mean, you can't make a compelling case for Carolina.
*  All you can do is say historically teams that, you know, get blown out and lose by,
*  by the number of points that they lose in game one, come into game two and cover,
*  cover at an incredible rate.
*  I mean, there's nothing in the X's and O's to commend Carolina.
*  The thing I was so blown away by how tough that Chargers defense was.
*  Like magically you flip a switch.
*  Like my guy, look at my guy, Joey Bofa, Joey Bofa dominant, dominant.
*  He's on the injury report.
*  Oh no.
*  No, it's just, he's questionable now and for week two, but it's Joey Bosa.
*  Like just you have to factor that in with them.
*  He's questionable.
*  Joey Bosa
*  forced fumble, uh, led the team in, in, in, in, in tackles.
*  Yeah.
*  He's the Riddler.
*  He's questionable at all times.
*  Both of these nuts is not missing this game.
*  Both of these nuts is here.
*  He's going to show up for this game.
*  So we like first half in the game, minus one 30 have them marked down.
*  Cards Rams fits here.
*  This looks too easy case where it's cards minus one and a half in Arizona.
*  But McVeigh owns the Cardinals.
*  They have a bad defense, but McVeigh has all these offensive line
*  issues already, Pook is out.
*  I like the way the cards played last week.
*  We're taping this before Miami Buffalo.
*  So it's hard to say how impressive the cards putting up 28 and driving for a
*  game winning touchdown at the end and not getting it.
*  Um, is this a stay away to you or should we
*  consider it?
*  It's a stay away.
*  I mean, if I was going to do anything, I would tease the Rams up, um, you know,
*  from the one and a half and get them up to over seven and a half up to seven and
*  a half, but I, there's no reason we don't, we're not compelled to play it.
*  Okay.
*  There's a ton of teaser legs that I like this week.
*  And I'm going to talk about them right now.
*  I, there's some, watch out for that teaser.
*  Chiefs just seemed too easy and just super fun to throw in.
*  I gotta say, I, I don't want to have a bet for against the Bengals this week
*  because I don't know what's going on with them.
*  Right.
*  It just seems like a classic.
*  Everyone likes the chiefs and then the Bengals actually look like the Bengals
*  are like, Oh my God, I can't believe I fell for the Bengals suck thing.
*  They do this every year.
*  I just want to know part of that game.
*  I'm with can we cross that one off?
*  Cross off.
*  Houston home for the bears is the Sunday night game, I think.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  This is the chaser tease where if you did do well on Sunday, you guys talked about
*  this on the ringer gambling show.
*  Then that Sunday night it's like, I'm down Houston tease with, with Philly on
*  Monday night and I'll, I'll rally back.
*  Something scares me about this game.
*  And I love Houston.
*  I have AFC South Houston bets.
*  I have Houston for the one seat.
*  I have Houston in the super bowl, but I don't know why it looks too easy.
*  It just looks too easy.
*  That's it.
*  I don't have a rational reason.
*  Oh, see, I feel a little more confident about this one.
*  And I'm not saying let's walk in and lay the points.
*  I prefer to play it as a teaser leg.
*  Um, I think on a, on that national stage, that Sunday night, I think they're
*  good, they're, they intend to come out and embarrass the bears.
*  And I don't think it's going to take very much effort because, um, speaking
*  of, of, of Michael and Barty, did he talk about the bears offensive line and, and
*  the, the atrocious play and their inability, um, last week against Tennessee.
*  Now Tennessee has a much improved defense for sure, but, uh, Caleb was running for
*  his life and that definitely played a role in, in how inaccurate he was and how
*  lackluster, uh, average passing yards.
*  Well, we did have, we had the conversation of, is did the bears defense look good
*  or is Will Levis terrible?
*  And the answer is Will Levis might be terrible and the bears might be slightly
*  good, but yeah.
*  All right.
*  So, all right, you talked me into it.
*  Texans minus six and a half teaser.
*  Ravens minus eight and a half.
*  And I think that line bumps up, um, higher than that against Las Vegas.
*  I just think Las Vegas, I just want to keep betting against them.
*  Don't rally back.
*  They'll win their state.
*  They'll beat Casey somehow.
*  They'll have a couple of dumb wins down the road, but right now I want to bet
*  against them.
*  So with the teas, you could take the Ravens under three to two and a half.
*  You could take the Texans down to, um, a half point.
*  And then I also like the Eagles against Atlanta and I think all three of those
*  should go together.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, the Eagles against Atlanta is going to end up like all over my card in so
*  many different ways with like alt spreads and all kinds of stuff.
*  Uh, because, well, and her cousins can't move.
*  They didn't run a single play action play.
*  The whole world knows it and is talking about it.
*  What are they possibly?
*  And part of the thing with, with Atlanta, like, how can you be this unprepared?
*  How can you show up against, you know, you're playing Pittsburgh in, in, in week
*  one and you can't put this guy under center and run play action.
*  Well, they didn't do it because he can't, he can't move.
*  Right.
*  So how is that like a responsible to him, to cousins, and how is it a fair to the
*  rest of his teammates to put that dude in that position?
*  Pittsburgh knew every play that Atlanta was going to run based on the formation.
*  So we can, uh, put those three together.
*  That's plus one 40 on Fandall for a six point tees.
*  What could go wrong?
*  Also, we could use our hammer because they have a double your winnings on any
*  Moneyline bet and we could use our hammer.
*  I think on that, or we could use our hammer on that Chargers bet.
*  I'd rather use it on the Chargers bet because the script for me with the
*  Chargers is a low scoring Chargers just come in and take care of business.
*  Like they're up 17 to six, right?
*  The Carolina gets two field goals over the course of the game.
*  Chargers just, you know, they're still, you know, keeping the training wheels on
*  Herbert because they, he's, he's whatever that planner, Fesheitis or whatever his
*  issue is with his foot, he didn't look great.
*  They're not trying to push the ball down the field.
*  They just want to control the ball, let their defense do its thing.
*  They don't, you don't have to do anything against Carolina.
*  Carolina certainly isn't going to put any pressure on the Chargers.
*  Just run the ball, run the ball, run the ball.
*  27 runs for 176 yards against the vaunted Raiders and their vaunted defensive line.
*  They went in there.
*  No Tyree Wilson this week for the Raiders.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So I like it.
*  So Fandl, we get to use this on our million dollar picks with fake money, but
*  they have a double your winnings profit boost.
*  We used it last week with the Lions money line, which was minus one 98.
*  And then we won and we went $204,000.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, we did.
*  Basically we won our money back and then a little bit more on that.
*  So we have that one to play just quickly going through the stay aways.
*  Lions bucks.
*  Lions are another tease candidate.
*  I want to see the bucks for another week because they, they had a little, nobody
*  believes in us last week and I know they're banged up in the secondary and I get it.
*  Yeah, I have them in.
*  I kind of want to see them.
*  It's a tease of a leg.
*  They're very comfortable playing in Detroit.
*  We've already seen it.
*  All right.
*  I get it.
*  Jets Titans is a complete stay away from me.
*  Stay away.
*  It's three and a half Seahawks, Pat's.
*  I just want to see the paths again.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  I actually, I went from, I had three different futures going against the past to kind of
*  liking their underdog money line in week two, but I think it's stay away.
*  Cowboys, saints.
*  I get it.
*  I just don't trust the Cowboys.
*  I think the saints, I just don't, I, I just don't trust them.
*  You're not roping me in because you killed Cleveland.
*  What I had them under all spring and all summer.
*  I did not believe in them.
*  I didn't think there'd be a playoff team and I'm not going to overreact because they
*  beat Deshaun Watson.
*  It's not an overreaction.
*  The number is exactly where the look ahead was six.
*  I get it.
*  And now it's six and a half.
*  I'm not overreacting to what I saw last week.
*  I still don't believe in the Dallas team.
*  I don't want to put money in them.
*  Okay.
*  You can put your money in them.
*  I will.
*  I will.
*  It might be my best bet on wise guys on Sunday.
*  Why are we still doing that show after everyone lost their wise guy best bet?
*  Did anyone win?
*  Did you win?
*  I did not win my, of course I lost my half point.
*  No, I didn't.
*  I had Pittsburgh on the money line.
*  So that was when I was plus for the week.
*  Cause I hit Pittsburgh on the money line.
*  Is did Raheem retire after he had Carolina as his best bet in week one or
*  now he's going to come back.
*  Every smart guy on earth with all summer long touting Carolina.
*  Oh, they added these weapons on offense and the progression was second year
*  quarterbacks.
*  Nobody could explain how trading their very best defensive players was going to
*  help them win football games.
*  They, they, they
*  not having the first round pick that it was too.
*  They'll have one.
*  They'll have one this coming year.
*  Yeah, though.
*  It's going to be probably number one.
*  49ers at Vikings.
*  I'm staying away.
*  I don't know why, but Minnesota, I don't know what what's going on with Sam
*  Darnold, but I want to watch another week.
*  Minnesota did beat San Francisco last year.
*  And then the last one washed in giants.
*  I have a new category called the both of these teams can fuck off.
*  I just want to go part of this.
*  Both of these teams can fuck.
*  I hit the FO line.
*  We should come up with a name for that.
*  I'm not going to feel stupid if somebody, if the team that I pick in our picks pool,
*  the other team wins.
*  I was like, Oh, I should have known.
*  There's no, I should have known what giants.
*  This is a thousand percent a teaser like for me.
*  I mean, the only team that Danny dimes has any success whatsoever against is
*  Washington.
*  He's five, one and one against Washington with 1500 passing yards, 10 touchdowns,
*  three picks.
*  All he does is torture Washington and, and the giants have a good pass rush.
*  Um, so I'm, I'm concerned for my guy, my guy JD.
*  So we're bumping Cardinals.
*  It looks like we have four, four games, which we disagree.
*  We don't even, do we even have an argue pick?
*  I guess we can double as their argue pick.
*  Well, I'm just telling you for million dollar picks, we're doing the Steelers,
*  the Jaguars, the Colts, and then we're doing that tease and we're doing Chargers.
*  So we got five bets.
*  Steelers, Jaguars make, make the Colts our argue pick.
*  So what that will also we can double.
*  If love, um, plays, I'll let you, you know, back off of it.
*  We won't call it the argue pick.
*  You know what?
*  I'm not afraid of him in his MCO.
*  He shouldn't play, but even, even if he plays, uh, one
*  Once again, I did win the argue pick last week.
*  Chargers Raiders.
*  We did back Antonio Pierce.
*  He punted from the 40 yard line right in your face.
*  Yeah.
*  Down to the eight.
*  And then he promptly, his vaunted defense, this brilliant defensive guru,
*  let the Chargers run right down their effing throat on a 92 yard drive.
*  Congratulations, Antonio.
*  Way to go.
*  I was just excited to watch somebody punt from the 40 yard line.
*  I didn't, we hadn't seen that since like we were in college.
*  Do you think that every stadium that he goes to, he's going and grabbing a little
*  bit of turf so that it can go into his memento case?
*  Cause he, this is it.
*  This is, this is a, he's a one and done and it'll be lucky if he gets all the way
*  through 17, we're already looking at him.
*  If we have to replace Rahim, if Rahim does a Carolina best bet this week,
*  I don't think if JJ just keeps taking the dolphins, maybe he could host wise guy.
*  I don't know.
*  JJ does all the dolphins tonight.
*  We're taping this before the dolphins came.
*  Okay.
*  The million dollar picks for week two, we are up $364,000 and it should have been
*  more, but the jets and big shot Bob Salah would not cooperate.
*  We have a little disagreements on these picks, but we're going to plow ahead anyway.
*  You're going to be happy that we took the Steelers minus two and a half in
*  Denver against Bonix.
*  This is a straight, Hey, Steelers defense, just a straight, straight, straight.
*  Just take us home.
*  That's it.
*  Justin Fields.
*  Just don't throw the ball over the middle.
*  Run around a little, throw to fryer moves, throw deep down the sidelines to pick
*  and swice and then let your defense do the rest.
*  My job is just to be a consigliere to give you the other side and considerations.
*  We're putting $200,000 on that.
*  Hopefully Justin Fields does not screw it up for us.
*  Next game.
*  Jaguars minus three at home for the Browns.
*  I, this, this is a personal one for me.
*  I still believe in the Jaguars.
*  They didn't throw me up their scent.
*  No Nujoku for Cleveland banged up offensive line for Cleveland, Cleveland on
*  the road and most important, this might be Deshaun Watson's last start ever.
*  And I want to have money against him one last time.
*  I'm really looking forward to it.
*  Not arguing you out of it.
*  I still think Jackson's deed might be Jacksonville's deed might be
*  legit good Jaguars minus three.
*  Maybe it'll be a push, whatever.
*  200,000 on that.
*  Here we go.
*  Our argue pick as well.
*  I'm want to know in the argue pick Colts minus three Packers.
*  I overruled house house was trying to convince me not to bet against Malik
*  Willis and we had an argument about it.
*  And I won the argument because we're betting against Malik Willis that I just,
*  this feels like Christmas in mid September.
*  I understand.
*  I just want to, I'm just searching.
*  I'm going to be texting you with the whole game as he's throwing the ball.
*  It's it's hitting guys in the face mask.
*  He's throwing it to the other team.
*  You know, the guy holding the first down chain.
*  All kidding aside, here's a preview of wise guys.
*  Whatever the pass attempt total is for Malik Willis, it's an auto bet under.
*  There is no auto bet under whatever the number of pass attempts that the books
*  have put out there for Malik Willis under under under the floor wall tolerated.
*  Can we bet that?
*  Oh, you definitely can.
*  You can definitely.
*  Is that a bet we could do right now?
*  Now, now you got, now you screwed up million dollar picks.
*  I don't see that on the, I'm sure they'll have that this weekend.
*  Now they'll have it this weekend.
*  They don't put those up until over the weekend.
*  I'm good point.
*  Good point.
*  Good point.
*  Speaking of Fandl, Fandl was still doing their double your winnings bet where
*  whatever the money line on the bet, they'll double it with their little profit
*  boost token.
*  We did this last week.
*  We went on the lines, money line.
*  We're going to do it again this week.
*  We're going to bet 200 K on.
*  I was a 200.
*  Maybe we should bet 150.
*  The Chargers first half Chargers game is minus one 30.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So we're going to bet 130,000 on that.
*  And if it wins, Fandl is going to double our money and we'll win $200,000 back.
*  Chargers win the first half.
*  Chargers win the game.
*  Did some research on the Panthers.
*  I think they only won the first half last year, three times.
*  In 2020, 23, they did not win the first half this week as well.
*  In Jim Harbaugh.
*  We trust I'm going to try to overlook the part that Herbert looks terrible.
*  Yeah.
*  Chargers D look great.
*  They're going to run the ball and, and I'm not afraid of Bryce Young.
*  Last but not least a teaser Ravens minus eight and a half against Vegas.
*  The Eagles on Monday night minus six and a half against the statue of Kirk
*  Cousins, the Texans who I think we both believe in minus six and a half against
*  Chicago, we're going to bring all of those lines down by six points.
*  That is plus one 40 on Fandl.
*  Lamar is 32 and 11 at home.
*  Vegas has four road wins in 2022 and 2023 in this year.
*  They haven't played on the road yet.
*  Raiders D gave up 176 yards rushing last week.
*  Ravens just run it down their throats.
*  Just run it.
*  I don't need to make the case to bet against the statue of Kirk Cousins.
*  And then we both believe in this Houston team.
*  We do.
*  We're going to put a special 200 K on that plus one.
*  I love that one.
*  You know, I did those are the million dollar picks for week two.
