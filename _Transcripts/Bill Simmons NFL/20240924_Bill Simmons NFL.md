# Five Biggest Bummer NFL Teams So Far With Sheil Kapadia  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAT2r80_N0E)
*  I asked to do five favorites, five train wrecks, five disappointments.
*  What's the title?
*  I did five biggest bummer seasons through week three.
*  So the fan bases are just like, uh, this, you know, this isn't kind of going the way
*  we were hoping it would go.
*  So I was trying to figure out the right way to phrase it through three weeks.
*  So that's what I came up with.
*  So five biggest bummers.
*  We're going to go five to one.
*  So your fifth biggest bummer is who?
*  San Francisco 49ers.
*  They're one and two.
*  They blow a 10 point lead against the Rams.
*  I'm not writing them off, but if you were a 49ers fan going into the season and
*  you're like super, this kind of feels like a Super Bowl hangover season with all
*  the off season drama.
*  Now Christian McCaffrey's going to Germany, Bill, which you've been on this
*  for like 10 years.
*  It's not good when you go to Germany.
*  Yeah.
*  I got a bunch of texts.
*  They're like, Oh, Germany watch McCaffrey.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like, you've been making that joke for a decade and now he's actually, it's
*  actually a headline.
*  Christian McCaffrey is going to Germany to get his Achilles checked out.
*  So that's not great.
*  They played it without Debo, Samuel and George Kittle on Sunday.
*  Their defensive tackle, Javon Hargrave is now likely out for the season.
*  So it's like all these things together.
*  And I actually think Brock Purdy's playing well, like they're often to over 400
*  yards of offense on Sunday without any of those guys.
*  He was really good.
*  So that's the bright spot.
*  If you're a Niners fan, you're like, we still have Shanahan Purdy's playing well.
*  We can still save this thing, but just the injuries and then the way the defense is
*  playing and you're one and two, it hasn't gone the way you would have liked.
*  Yeah.
*  So we're thinking about this three months from now and the Niners are fine.
*  We're like, Oh, remember after week three, we'd probably look back and go, well,
*  Minnesota defense week two, they're buzz off, right?
*  Week three, bunch of injuries.
*  They're up 14, nothing fake punt game flips.
*  And the Rams just kind of steal the game.
*  And then we panicked.
*  We're like, Oh my God, the Niners.
*  And then all of a sudden they were fine.
*  I guess the hard grave thing was the one that really made me pause.
*  Cause now you're going to be able to run on them.
*  I would, I would assume unless they have some secret dude, you know, off their bench,
*  he's just going to come in and stuff and stuff the run.
*  I already felt like they were a little vulnerable.
*  It felt like you could move the ball on them and throw on them, especially if you're
*  behind and now it feels like you're gonna be able to run on them combined with like
*  they pay IU who hasn't really done anything to get this crazy game out of Jennings.
*  Debo and Kittle getting hurt is the least surprising, you know, like I'm just
*  factoring that in those guys eight games a year, but, um, my big fear for them,
*  Sheila is that the NFC West might be really good.
*  It might just be one of those where we might have three play outs.
*  Sal and I talked about it Sunday.
*  There might be three playoff teams and I don't even know which three it's going to be.
*  I've been really impressed by Arizona.
*  I think they're legit, like a little frisky.
*  So, you know, I look at the Niners and I go, are they one more injury away from
*  being the year from hell team?
*  Cause right now it's either them or the Rams for the year from hell team, right?
*  Unless you're going to say since.
*  Yeah, I'm with you.
*  You kind of give their offense the benefit of the doubt.
*  Like the floor is, it's going to be pretty high unless like Purdy goes down or
*  some one more injury happens, but defensively they make that coordinator change in the
*  off season and now they've got injuries and like their defense was not good in
*  that.
*  I mean, their defense, their defense and special teams blew that game.
*  I don't, I really don't think it was the offense's fault on Sunday.
*  So you're right.
*  I mean, there's no walk over in the NFC West where you just like chalk that up to
*  a win.
*  The Cardinals can score, the Rams can score as long as Stafford's healthy.
*  And then the Seahawks can kind of win in different ways.
*  So yeah, I'm with you.
*  That that division is going to be competitive all the way through.
*  Do you agree with me on Arizona?
*  Cause I thought they've had two losses and I really thought both losses were good
*  losses.
*  I think you can have good losses.
*  I was impressed with how they hung with Buffalo.
*  I was impressed with how they hung last week.
*  I just, I think they're in these games.
*  They hung with Detroit.
*  Detroit was felt like they were going to go up by 30 and they just never did.
*  Yeah.
*  I think offensively I buy into the Cardinals.
*  I think Kyler was a little bit off last week, but he was really good the first two
*  weeks.
*  So I think they're going to be able to move the ball and score most weeks.
*  They might have like the most gettable defense though in the NFL.
*  Yeah.
*  Like the lions couldn't put them away last week, but I just think if you look at
*  it week to week, I mean, they just don't have players on defense.
*  I don't know what scheme you draw up there.
*  So that's what I worry about, but I think they'll play entertaining games and I
*  think their offense is going to keep them in a lot of games.
*  Don't sleep on how bad Washington's defenses.
*  I mean, burrow, I don't, since then, I don't think they punted yesterday.
*  They didn't.
*  All right.
*  So on the Niners last thing, it's, it's probably more fun for the NFL if they
*  have a year from health season, just cause that's going to infuse some new
*  blood in the NFC.
*  The big picture piece though of, of this is the last year with Purdy on the deal
*  that he's on and you start thinking about windows with the NFL, which are always
*  three, four, five years maybe.
*  And then you really have to reinvent your window.
*  And it, you know, that was my feeling with them heading into the year, like
*  what, what's the window of this team?
*  Can they sustain it?
*  Can they extend it?
*  And this has not gone well.
*  And now having McCaffrey hurt the reason you got McCaffrey for not even
*  happening about the first round pick is because he's injury prone.
*  Well, he lasted a year, he got injured.
*  So there's, there's some red flags everywhere, but Rams have red flags,
*  Arizona's defense, Seattle's already banged up, has lost a couple of guys.
*  They can't block.
*  So fascinating division.
*  All right, let's go.
*  You're number four.
*  Biggest bummer.
*  Number four is the Chicago Bears.
*  And I was deciding, should I put them on here?
*  Cause you're, if you're a Bears fan, you're like, we still get to watch
*  Caleb Williams every week.
*  We still have hope.
*  There's some excitement here, but the infrastructure around this
*  guy is a complete disaster.
*  They are 32nd in offensive DVO way through three weeks.
*  They had the worst offense in the NFL.
*  Their offensive line is a mess.
*  Do you want to guess what their running backs are averaging yards per carry?
*  It can't be more than like three yards of carry, right?
*  2.3 yards per carry bill 56 carries for 130 yards.
*  They had this sequence against the Colts where they have first in
*  goal from the four yard line.
*  They go direct snap to Khalil Herbert.
*  Then they go two more runs to Khalil Herbert.
*  And then on fourth and goal, they run one of the worst plays you'll see all season.
*  Speed option with so bad.
*  They lose to who loses 12 yards on fourth and goal from the one.
*  Like we watched a lot of football.
*  I've never seen that before in my life.
*  So I was thinking like, if the athletic came out with an article this week and
*  was like, the Bears haven't been practicing this season.
*  I'd be like, oh, OK, yeah, I know that that's what it looks like.
*  It's looked like that since week one.
*  So this isn't like a Caleb Williams take.
*  This is just like, do they know what they're doing there?
*  Because the Colts maybe had the worst run defense in the NFL.
*  They couldn't run the football on them.
*  Caleb Williams, I think, dropped back to pass like 52 times in that game.
*  They're having issues with just like calling timeouts before
*  two point conversions and stuff.
*  They don't look like a well coached team.
*  I thought their formula coming into the season was very good defense.
*  And can you create like a mediocre offense?
*  Can the line be good enough?
*  Because I think that would have been good enough to make the playoffs.
*  And their offense just right now is a complete disaster.
*  So the Bears to me, as someone who picked them to make the playoffs
*  and now they're plus two 90 to make the playoffs after three weeks,
*  they're having a bummer of a season.
*  They can't block. Yeah.
*  They are number one in the they can't block rankings somehow ahead of the Patriots,
*  who also can't block.
*  But that play you mentioned, that fourth down play
*  at all the games on and they were in the left corner TV.
*  And I'm watching everything.
*  And I knew it was for down, but two things happen.
*  And then I look back and I just see a Bears guy going backwards.
*  And I'm like, wait, what was that guy going backwards?
*  I thought it was for down.
*  And they somehow ran a play that had somebody go backwards eight yards to coaching.
*  It's really tough to say this with Sirianni and Doug Peterson
*  and some of the coaching disasters we've seen this season.
*  But I think he perfuses up there as they seem the least prepared.
*  The coaching decisions during the game are bad.
*  It doesn't seem like they have an idea how to use timeouts or challenges.
*  And then for Caleb, when they can't block for them,
*  they still have them going back and, you know, going backwards
*  and trying to look for guys for four or five seconds.
*  He doesn't have four or five seconds.
*  So, you know, before the season, Jaden Daniels was, I think, six to one
*  for rookie of the year.
*  And Caleb was plus 120.
*  And we talked about it on our future pods.
*  I know you did, too.
*  We're like, yeah, why are those ads so different?
*  Like, what what happens to we have that Jaden Daniels isn't
*  in as good of a situation as Caleb?
*  And everyone was saying this is the best situation anyone's walked into.
*  They can't fucking block and their coach sucks.
*  So not a good situation.
*  And you need a coordinator in 2024 where if you don't have a great offensive line,
*  they can scheme around it like we see that with guys.
*  Mike McDaniel, Kyle Shanahan.
*  You look at those teams and you're like, oh, they don't have the best offensive
*  lines, but they figure out ways to scheme around it.
*  And Shane Waldron of the Bears, like I was like, all right, this guy,
*  it seems like an upgraded offensive coordinator.
*  They're not doing anything to scheme around their offensive line weaknesses.
*  And now you look at Seattle, he came over from the Seahawks and it's like,
*  Seahawks look like they're, you know, they're operating a little bit better
*  without him. So now you have to revisit that coaching decision.
*  So, yeah, if I were a Bears fan, I would just be like,
*  we can't let Caleb Williams develop bad habits this season where it's like
*  next year or two years from now. It's like, oh, well, that rookie here,
*  they couldn't block for him. And so he started bailing from the pocket or,
*  you know, he sustained an injury that that has to be like their number one goal
*  for the rest of the season.
*  I thought it was going to be their goal going into last week because they're
*  facing the Colts. It's like, that should be a get right game.
*  And meanwhile, they still can't run the football or protect him.
*  Who leads the league and Zach Wilson's this year of going back to pass
*  immediately panicking and rolling out to the right and then throwing it out of
*  bounds. Cause it's, it's Caleb or Deshawn probably in the finals for that. Right.
*  Yes. Well, that's gotta be Deshawn Watson who we will get to here in a minute.
*  Okay. Let's go. What's your number three bummer?
*  Three is the Cincinnati Bengals. And I have been in on the Bengals.
*  I've been saying don't the Bengals are going to be fine and they're oh,
*  in three bill, but their offense is really playing well.
*  They have a top five offense by any metric you look at. You mentioned it.
*  Monday night, they did not punt. They did not turn the football over seven possessions,
*  four touchdowns, two field goals and a missed field goal.
*  If they would have gotten one stop on defense, one forced punt,
*  they win that game. They're one and two. We're saying, wow, Joe Burrow, Jamar,
*  Chase, that looked great. You know,
*  the Bengals kind of turn their season around and they can't get a stop on
*  defense. And so now they're oh, in three were since 2000.
*  I think one team has made the playoffs after they're oh, in three.
*  And so the bummer is just that like if you would have told me before the season,
*  Bengals are oh, in three. But what we have said, we would have said,
*  oh, Burrows not healthy. Oh, did Jamar Chase get injured? Oh, the offense,
*  you know, it's just not working. No Burrows healthy and playing well.
*  Chase is out there. Higgins is back. The offense is working.
*  And they're still oh, in three. And so now you zoom out and you say, well,
*  they might lose Higgins after the season.
*  And how many healthy seasons are you going to get from Burrow going forward?
*  I mean, hopefully a lot, but you don't know.
*  And so I feel like they're kind of wasting a season right now at oh,
*  in three, although I might be the only person in the world who's still like,
*  I'm not totally out on them. It's a long season. Let's see what happens.
*  But yeah, they've just dug themselves a hole unnecessarily.
*  Yeah. I'm looking at the oh, in three. So wow.
*  2018 Texans was the last one, 11 and five.
*  Before that 1998 bills, 10 and six.
*  Who? 95 lines, 10 and six.
*  That's in the last 30 years. There's been three total. Not likely. Yeah.
*  I'm kind of with you. I look, their defense sucks.
*  I don't know what happened to it. They didn't have a pass rush at all.
*  I don't think Hendrickson's healthy, but it just feels like you can move the ball
*  on them whenever you want. We've seen that over and over again,
*  but I liked how they played against the chiefs.
*  I liked how their offense looked last night against a crappy Washington defense.
*  The question for me is what's the seven seed win total?
*  If it's nine, I can't count them out. If it's 10,
*  that means they have to go 10 and four down the stretch.
*  They're in a really hard division, right?
*  And their defense isn't good and 10 and four doesn't seem realistic to me,
*  but nine and five is inconceivable.
*  Yeah. It's defensively. I don't know what their answers are.
*  Like they had a couple of defensive tackles out last night,
*  but it's like you have to figure something out. I mean,
*  their run defense was an issue last year and going into the season and it hasn't
*  been fixed at all here. So I don't know that there is a fix.
*  I think they could be a feisty team. I think their offense,
*  like if you just look at it historically, if you have a top five offense,
*  you're in the playoffs every year. Like you could take everything else out of it.
*  And there's almost no precedent for having that good of an offense and not
*  making the playoffs. That's why I'm not totally counting them out,
*  but it does feel like, man, what a wasted opportunity. They were what?
*  Seven and what were they?
*  Seven and a half point favorites in week one against the Patriots,
*  something like that. And then seven and a half point favorites on Monday night,
*  you lose both those games.
*  Like they went into the season with an easy schedule and now two games that were
*  supposed to be easy wins. You lost both of those.
*  So the path was indefensible. I mean, they scored 10 points against the Pats.
*  Yesterday they didn't punt. So in two weeks in week one,
*  they seem like a team that had in practice or run any preseason reps.
*  In week three, their offense actually looked good and it still didn't matter.
*  I can't count them out yet because what do we see the Packers last year were
*  three and six and made the playoffs? Yeah.
*  So if the Bengals can get to three and six, but I just,
*  there's teams I like more in the AFC, I guess it'd be the counter, right?
*  Definitely Buffalo, probably the jets.
*  There's an AFC South team. I'd like Pittsburgh more than Cincy.
*  I just think their defense is better than anyone that thing.
*  I would take Baltimore over the, over Cincy at this point.
*  And then sheaves and I, where do you stand on the Chargers?
*  It's I mean, now that like Herbert's dealing with the injury,
*  they have one way they can win. Like they can't win in multiple ways.
*  Maybe their defense continues to play well and they reel off a couple of 50 yard
*  runs each week. I think they're going to be well coached.
*  And I think they're going to be competitive and feisty. We'll see,
*  like I'm not sure that they're going to make the playoffs,
*  but I think they'll be in the mix.
*  So they had a bunch of injuries off that week three game.
*  And I think that, so they're going to lose to the chiefs this week.
*  Suddenly they're two and two and,
*  and maybe they're just going to be too banged up this year.
*  And then Herbert re-injured that ankle and that's not going to be right for a
*  couple of weeks. So maybe they're out. So maybe we have one AFC West team,
*  one AFC South team. I think that's safe. Buffalo and the jets.
*  So that's one, two, three, four.
*  So that would be three from the AFC North.
*  Yeah. They got a chance. I'm not counting them out. Right. Yeah.
*  Well, especially like if Cleveland, we, I'm sure they're coming up right now.
*  They're next. So yeah. So maybe, maybe it is nine and eight, nine and eight.
*  It's doable. All right. Who's your number two bummer?
*  Yeah, it is the Cleveland Browns.
*  And there's really a case for them to be number one. I mean, you look at this team,
*  I don't think we've appreciated how terrible Deshaun Watson has been.
*  Like when we talk about it, we're like, Oh, he hasn't lived up to the hype.
*  You know, he hasn't been quite what they expected. Last three years, Bill,
*  39 quarterbacks have had 500 drop-backs.
*  He ranks 36th in success rate ahead of Davis Mills,
*  Zach Wilson and Bryce Young.
*  Like it's time to take the kid gloves off when we talk about just his on field
*  performance, let alone the off field stuff.
*  He's been one of the worst quarterbacks in the NFL for three years.
*  It's been one of the worst Browns quarterbacks like ever. Like, yeah,
*  Austin had a, yeah, about that, about he's in the Browns have had
*  two and a half decades of terrible quarterbacks and he's like at the bottom.
*  Yeah. They're 31st in offensive DVOA. They've had offensive line injuries.
*  I understand that the quarterback makes the offensive line injuries worse.
*  He's got to be one of the worst quarterbacks to block for.
*  He's a disaster under pressure.
*  He's getting sacked on 12% of his drop-backs.
*  And so now what do you do if you're the Browns because of the contract they gave
*  him, which was the only way they were going to get him because they were the
*  only team that was going to give him that guaranteed contract.
*  The minute they gave him that deal,
*  he became the most powerful guy in the organization other than the owner.
*  Because now if you're the owner, you say we're tied to him for two more years.
*  You're going to bench him for Jamis Winston and we're paying our backup
*  $46 million per year. And we gave up all that draft capital. So that's one option.
*  Two is to keep trotting him out there. I mean,
*  I don't know where that's going to get you. You've had years to figure this out.
*  And now you have your worst offensive line situation. So you can't do that.
*  And then look ahead to the off season. What are you,
*  can you run this back in 2025 with the same coach,
*  the same GM and the same quarterback and say it's going to be different this
*  year? I don't think so. I think the coach and the GM are, are pretty good.
*  Like I think they would get hired pretty quickly if they were out there on the
*  open market. And now you have this lawsuit and these allegations of sexual assault.
*  So is he going to be facing a suspension? It's just like,
*  this is the one of the most hopeless situations in the NFL.
*  They have no chance to compete in the AFC with this guy.
*  And they also have no way out of this.
*  Yeah. I remember this happened to Celtics in the mid 2000s.
*  They traded for Vin Baker, you know, max contract.
*  And he had a bunch of problems that turned out he had alcohol issues and he just,
*  contract just went forever. And the way the salary cap worked,
*  you just looked at it. This was like two,
*  I might even written about it at the time 2003, 2004.
*  And you just look at it and you go, Oh my God,
*  there's no way out of this for three years. Like we're, we're basically,
*  we're in the salary cap league and one of our max spots is just like throw away
*  zero. And this Cleveland situation is way worse than that.
*  Cause it's the quarterback position.
*  Really it seems like the only move is to bench them.
*  But now you have Sullen angry overpaid Deshaun Watson on your bench who might,
*  God only knows what he could do for team chemistry.
*  He said, but I, I don't see any other solution other than to just send them away
*  from the team. Just like, we'll, we'll send your checks every two weeks.
*  If I'm the owner and I guess that's what this guy has,
*  I'm thinking you guys got to make this work. If you don't make this work,
*  I'll I'll get, bring somebody else in to make it work.
*  It's the owner has to realize this has no chance.
*  And it doesn't seem like that's happened yet. Right.
*  Cause they would have replaced them already. Yeah. I mean he was,
*  cause he, cause he signed off on it. You know, was he a driving factor or did,
*  yeah. So it's like,
*  he's the one who guaranteed the money when Watson's like,
*  I don't want to go to Cleveland and has some, like, uh,
*  what if we guarantee all the money? Exactly. All right.
*  I guess I'll go to Cleveland. I mean, think about it.
*  No quarterbacks gotten that sense.
*  There've been a lot of great quarterbacks who have signed deals since.
*  And we thought, oh, is this going to set a precedent for quarterbacks? Nope.
*  No other team has been willing to do this with any other quarterback.
*  They got desperate. They signed him to that deal. They're one and two.
*  They had the hardest remaining schedule in the NFL.
*  If you look at the betting markets and just like, uh, you know,
*  team win totals and Superbowl odds. And so there really is no way out for them.
*  I mean, if you look at it, they just, they said, oh,
*  maybe chub can come back week five. It's like,
*  I have chub on all my fantasy teams. They're saying like week nine.
*  It's not going to be week five. Yeah. The offensive line injuries, everything.
*  So Russell Wilson has had the, had the biggest dead cap hit in NFL history,
*  which is just like the amount of money on your salary cap to people who are you,
*  who aren't on your team. That was 85 million.
*  I think Watson would be like double that if they were to just say it's like 170,
*  if they cut him. So it's like, is that feasible? At some point,
*  you're just going to be like sunk cost, nothing we can do,
*  but I don't know if they're going to be at that point yet or not.
*  You know, it's funny. You would think in the 2020s,
*  we have the history of all the mistakes people have made over the last,
*  however many decades of football or any sport.
*  We have way better advanced analytics telling us how to make decisions.
*  We have smarter people. We have even podcasts are smarter and shows are smarter.
*  And there's all this good information we have now.
*  And yet we've seen three of the biggest mistakes in the history of the NFL,
*  Russell Wilson, the Bryce young trade and the Sean. Those are,
*  I've been following the NFL for, you know, five decades.
*  Those are three of the biggest mistakes since I've been a football fan and they
*  all happen within the span of three years. It's crazy.
*  How are we still making mistakes like this?
*  Yeah. I was thinking about it with the quarterbacks especially.
*  And we'll talk about Trevor Lawrence in a minute here,
*  but like watching Josh Allen last night,
*  it's kind of like there is no swing big enough to acquire a player like Josh
*  Allen. He is going to lift everyone around him.
*  You can make mistakes elsewhere on the roster and you're probably going to still
*  win 10 or 11 games. So when you have a chance to get a guy of that caliber,
*  you can take almost any big swing and it'll be justified.
*  But how many of those guys are there? Three, maybe four.
*  And now you have this big middle class of quarterbacks where it's like,
*  do you want to make excuses for this guy and say he's good and the situation
*  around him or do you not want to? Like you could make,
*  have those arguments for basically guys like six through 20, you know,
*  we could say, well, they're good here because their offensive line is good.
*  They're bad here because their scheming is bad.
*  And so you can't take the big swings unless you had just have a great
*  feeling that it's going to be one of those top four or five guys.
*  Otherwise the big swings for just like a competent guy who can be good under the
*  right situations. Those don't make sense.
*  They're too high risk and too low reward.
*  I would include Dak Prescott in that for $60 million a year.
*  And that there's,
*  I might be able to find Sam Darnold or Gino Smith or Baker Mayfield and have an
*  extra $50 million a year to spend on other parts of my roster.
*  The problem is if you don't find those guys and it's like, oh shit,
*  now we have this guy instead. And then it's trouble. All right.
*  Then you're the Arthur Smith Falcons. Yeah. Then you're the Arthur.
*  And you're just punting every year. All right.
*  Once the Jacksonville Jaguars is going to be a big storyline this week with the
*  way they played on Monday night.
*  I talked myself into the Jaguars going into the season. I know you, you did too.
*  And there was reason to, they were eight and three last year,
*  Trevor Lawrence battles four different injuries. They get bad turnover luck.
*  They get, they're dropping passes all over the place.
*  It's like this team could rebound and win nine or 10 games.
*  They drafted Brian Thomas Jr. Like that. Yeah. I was, I was in.
*  There was a case now they're oh, and three,
*  and we all know what's going to happen is that Doug Peterson is going to be out
*  of a job sometime between now and the end of the season.
*  And then there's going to be this conversation that I just mentioned.
*  Is it Trevor Lawrence or is it the scheme and the co, you know,
*  the coaching and the supporting cast and they mismanaged the roster
*  last three seasons built Trevor Lawrence at 39 turnovers.
*  That's second to Josh Allen and Josh Allen has so many high level plays that I
*  think the turnovers are like completely overrated because he makes up for them
*  almost every single time. That's just hasn't been the case with Trevor Lawrence.
*  He has 25 fumbles over the last three seasons, second to Justin Fields.
*  And the worst part of your Jaguars fan,
*  why they're number one on the bummer list is that he's playing like the worst
*  football of his career right now. I mean,
*  before he was really good at avoiding sacks.
*  Now he's getting sacked on 11% of his drop backs. His accuracy is not good.
*  He's not dealing with pressure. He had that interception Monday night.
*  And so I think what happens is so many people cling to like what their draft
*  evaluation was of a guy and they're like, no, he had all the tools.
*  He was a generational prospect that we just become blind to what we've seen four
*  years in the NFL.
*  Like there's not much precedent for a guy having 53 starts in the NFL and it's
*  like, well, he's not great yet, but he's going to become great.
*  Most of the time we know at this point in his career.
*  And so if you're a Jaguars fan, I'm not saying he's bad.
*  Like I still kind of like Trevor Lawrence. He's young.
*  I think he'll maybe have a moment down the road here or a season down the road
*  where he looks really good.
*  But I do think we need to kind of reset our expectations and be like,
*  this isn't the guy who was getting drafted one overall.
*  This is a guy we've watched in the NFL and he's had what one above average
*  season as a starter.
*  The first three years were explainable. Yeah. Right. Urban Meyer.
*  Last year he got hurt. So,
*  and that was one of the reasons I was totally into them in year four.
*  It was like, here we go. He's going to be healthy.
*  They finally got him a deep weapon. Like this is, this is it. We're,
*  we're on and it went backwards.
*  And unfortunately I've watched all three games. I have them on a fantasy team.
*  I have Jaguars futures and I really thought they were going to cover and
*  possibly win last night. And within what a half hour,
*  you knew you knew where it was going. I don't know what the answers are.
*  Like, like Ruiz was on my pod last week saying they're going to fire, um,
*  fire Peterson and bring in Belichick and it's going to happen. And,
*  and is Belichick going to put up with some of the shit Trevor Lawrence does?
*  Like I, we've already seen that.
*  We've already seen that with Mac Jones and Cam Newton, some of these other guys.
*  So I don't know what it is, but it does make me wonder,
*  should they have waited to do that extension?
*  What was the benefits of doing the extension?
*  Cause you still have the franchise tag thing, right?
*  You've never actually seen him be awesome and you're just going to give him
*  $275 million. Why not wait?
*  I think when you do that, then it becomes a DAC,
*  then you're paying going to be paying even more to your kind of taking a gamble
*  that, you know, this guy is going to be good enough.
*  I also think that it's okay for them to have given that to them because you know
*  how coaches and teams in the NFL operate.
*  If Trevor Lawrence was on the trade market right now,
*  I think you'd be shocked by what Trevor Lawrence would get.
*  Would he be worth more if he was on his original contract versus this giant
*  extension?
*  Yeah, that that that's true.
*  Then the team that trades for him though, probably is like, well, we have to,
*  as part of the trade, we have to sign him to a new deal as well.
*  So I understand why teams do it when you think you have a guy you kind of want,
*  you know,
*  you go earlier rather than later because teams do get desperate.
*  And if you really need to move off a guy like the Eagles had to do with Carson
*  Wentz a few years ago,
*  he was the worst quarterback in the NFL and they got a great draft capital from
*  the Colts. So I still like lean towards pay, you know, if you think,
*  if you feel good about it, go ahead and pay them.
*  Cause it's kind of like you always talk about with the NBA,
*  it's still an asset.
*  You're still going to be able to move off of them unless it's like a Deshaun
*  Watson type situation. But yeah, he hasn't had the moment yet.
*  And now it's just going to be like, all right,
*  he's going to be on his third coach in what five years,
*  another offensive coordinator and what it, what's it going to look like?
*  Maybe it'll happen for him. It still could.
*  I think he can certainly be a solid starter,
*  but kind of the guy we expected, like I was thinking about this.
*  If you flip Josh Allen and Trevor Lawrence,
*  those two quarterbacks on those two teams,
*  I kind of think the Jaguars are a pretty good team and the Bills are struggling
*  to make the playoffs. Now it might be unfair to compare them to Josh Allen,
*  but that just kind of tells you the gap between sort of the elite guys and where
*  someone like Trevor Lawrence might be right now.
*  It's pretty rare to just not have a moment for the first four years of your
*  career and 60 plus starts. And then all of a sudden the light switch goes up.
*  I did to borrow the image analogy and then we'll go like,
*  it's a little like where the Bulls were with Zach Levine, right? Where it's like,
*  well, this guy scores 25 points a game.
*  He's not a franchise guy, but we don't want to lose them either.
*  And here's a lot of money. And now they're now they can't even trade them.
*  And I do feel like we've seen teams get into that bind was quarterbacks were
*  like, well, if we don't have them, what are we going to do for a quarterback?
*  And it's like, yeah, but you're a quarterback. You can't win with.
*  I think the difference here is include, and I include the two of us.
*  We both thought he was going to make a leap this year.
*  There's some sort of disconnect between the talent and what we're suddenly that
*  throw he made that the Hamlin pick guy was wide open.
*  Only him and Anthony Richardson are making throws that bad in the league right
*  now. Anthony Richardson is the all time hit or miss guy. Lawrence isn't hitting.
*  Like he's just missing. And I think that's the difference. All right.
*  That was our bummer list. She'll Kapadia. You can,
*  you can listen to them on the ringer NFL show and on the ringer Philly special
*  read them on the ringer.com. He had a piece today. Good to see you, shield.
*  All right. Thanks for having me.
