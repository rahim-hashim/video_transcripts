# Are Tua Tagovailoa and the Dolphins Actually Good? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJbE4l9g1tk)
*  with Miami, we're going to have to play a game called, do you believe, do you believe in Tua?
*  I, I bet a, I've been a pretty big Tua critic and my case over and over again was like, I don't see
*  it. He has to show me, show me what makes you different. Show me the guy from college. In the
*  first half, it looked like he was on his way to maybe getting benched by Lake week four. He was
*  bad. Two picks. Second half, not only were his receivers open, but there were a couple Tua moments.
*  Like he had that spin move that he used to have in college, spun out of traffic that one time.
*  There was some athleticism. He was hitting guys on a dime and I don't know. It did feel like
*  something was different and now I'm, I'm a little more ready to believe that he might be decent.
*  Oh, I'm definitely a little more ready, but can I see one more game? Am I allowed to say,
*  one more game? I know he had six touchdown passes. I know it was a 28, three
*  comeback, but sometimes these games happen. Although the stat I read you so it shows that
*  these never happen. Complete fluke. Yeah. But, you know, when you get sick, they're down 21 points
*  and he's like doing a dance all the way back to the sideline after score. I'm like, what the hell,
*  what is going on with these? And don't forget it was 35 14. It probably could have been worse.
*  Didn't the Ravens fumble at the one yard line up seven, nothing. And then the dolphins came right
*  back and scored and then the, and then they Ravens put it on them before blowing the lead. But I
*  don't know. I just, um, this might be one of those again, well, this is what happens with week two,
*  right? People are like, I'm going to hang back. I'm not going to bet a lot. Um, I'm going to see
*  what week one gives us. Uh, and then I'll, I'm going to be an expert based on week one. And we
*  just weren't like, we just, the dolphins just didn't show me nearly this much against the Patriots have
*  just as much problems in the secondary, I think as the Ravens or the Patriots have a great defense.
*  I mean, the way they shut down Trubisky, he was never seen him struggle like that. Oh no,
*  I've seen it 20 times. Uh, here's the thing with Tua. I felt like the poise was there. We talked
*  about it on my Thursday pod compared to some of these other dudes where they, you know,
*  if it was within the first two seconds, it was fine. But if he was under pressure or he had to
*  ad lib, I just didn't see it. And today was the first game that he looked like the guy he was
*  supposed to be in college. And there was a poise to him and a presence that, um, was kind of what
*  he was advertised to be before he got hurt in college. Now, I don't know whether that means
*  there's some sort of breakthrough or the Ravens just completely fell apart. And maybe we don't
*  give enough credit to hard it is to defend Tyreek and Wado for an entire game. So we're going to
*  know, but I will say I'm more, I'm more receptive to the idea that you can win 11 games with Tua
*  than I was a week ago. I guess I am too. There's a spot. I, I couldn't figure out,
*  I knew there was a playoff spot for Miami or Denver, and I couldn't figure out who was going
*  to get it. Now I had Cincy in there too. And maybe we'll talk about Cincy after the break.
*  Yeah, we will. But I think Miami is a playoff team. I think that if Tyreek and Wado stay healthy,
*  the, that combo is an asset in a way that I don't think a lot of teams have assets like that. You
*  know, like Minnesota has Jefferson and Thielen. We can go down. There's probably seven teams that
*  they stand out for some reason. Their speed is really fucking frightening when you're betting
*  against it or playing against it. So I had the Miami Moneyline today. So I was rooting for it,
*  but I did. Well, I had, I had that for underdog parlay. I had Miami and Minnesota plus 450 and
*  million dollar picks. Lucky. Yeah. Right. That out of my butthole. Well, listen, they,
*  there's now no score that they can't come back from. Right. So that's, that's great in the clubhouse.
*  Right. So yeah, could they win 11? They won eight in a row last year, didn't they? Like we probably
*  should be believers in them. They just got a little unlucky. So today they, a hundred percent,
*  like there's nothing better than what they put up today. Do you believe in the two and oh giants?
*  All right. Let me start by saying I had them at eight and nine. Right. So I probably thought they
*  were going to be one and one at this point. I thought they were going to be a little better
*  than everybody else did. But let's remember they were at the same position with Joe Judge. They
*  loved him. He was the savior of parcels. Parcels could learn a lot from Joe Judge. And then they
*  fell in hate with him faster than anybody else. And they probably could have lost to Carolina.
*  Let's see them beat a good team like the Dallas Cowboys next week. They're going to win. I don't
*  want to say too much bad about them because they're going to be three and oh after they beat my team
*  next Monday night. But I don't believe they're a playoff team, but I think I still think they're
*  about eight and nine. Is that fair? Yeah, that might be a tiny bit better than that. We'll see.
*  There's a couple of things. Dayball looks like the best coach hour of the year. There's a confidence
*  and a swagger to him in the sideline that it has to be specific to the coach, especially compared
*  to last year when they had Joe Judge, who I think is now a towel boy with the Patriots. But there's
*  definitely a confidence to hit. Like Dana Jones stinks. So how are we supposed to believe? What
*  are we believing in then? If we were ranking the 32 starting quarterbacks, he would be one of the
*  five in the bottom, right? It would be him and Trubisky and a couple others. Yeah, five or seven.
*  And they were able to navigate around him because Barclays are good. I was really impressed by their
*  pass rush. I thought they were swarming around and I thought it felt like the Panthers were going to
*  steal the game. I thought Baker actually played pretty well. He was under duress a lot, but I
*  was really impressed by the D and by the fact that the Giants can move the chains when they need to.
*  Yeah, it was a pretty complete game. And it's a wonder when you watch a game that Barclay and
*  McCaffrey are in and neither of them get injured. Like, wow, this is really something else. This
*  should put this in the archives. But I think that's the problem with the Giants. I always expect
*  something bad to happen injury wise or falling apart or the team starting to hate the coach.
*  So I pumped the brakes a little bit on this 2-0 Giants team, although there are winnable
*  games. There are definitely winnable games on that schedule if you look at them.
*  And when we talked about their over-under, we talked about that was one of the cases for them
*  was the schedule. And then you get a break like Dak getting hurt. And now they catch Dak,
*  Dakless Cowboys in week three. But listen, I thought last week I liked the Panthers. I thought
*  they could have beaten the Browns. Browns hit a 59 yarder. This week they were in the game.
*  It was 16-16. The Giants moved the chains. They moved down. They got the go-ahead field
*  goal and they got some stops. Cooper Rush, do you believe? Yeah. Oh, Ewing Terry, come on in.
*  The committee is here. So you believe. You're into it. I don't want to misspeak here. And he's
*  not better than Dak Prescott. And there's no way I'm saying that right now, but there's a certain
*  calmness to him when he has to lead the team. And physically, Cooper Rush, physically he's not on par
*  and, you know, like it is, it is probably his field awareness and everything else is not the same,
*  but there is some kind of, it's not as chaotic with him as it is with Dak. And I can't even explain
*  it. And now people are going to give me shit for saying that Cooper Rush has been in Dak Prescott
*  and I'm not doing that. But I was confident that he could lead them to a field goal at the end.
*  I checked the Ewing Terry qualifications and Dak checked 20 of the 20 boxes. No, it's just all of
*  them. Like you haven't won anything with them. He's overrated for what his actual impact is.
*  And he, and he was obviously pretty replaceable because some guy named Cooper Rush came in today
*  and won the game for you. So not some guy, the guy, the guy, Cooper Rush.
*  Romo seemed like he liked them.
*  Romo likes him. Romo like took a big swing early on when they went for it on fourth and two. He's
*  like, you got to do that. Of course. I like this Mike McCarthy move. Cooper Rush is good. He's
*  confident. Get him in there. He's not as bad as everyone's set, man. And you say he's not as bad
*  as everyone says, like, oh, yeah, it's tough. And he converted. And that was that. But I'm in love
*  with this defense. I mean, we gave up two touchdowns total to Burrow and Brady and only
*  one through the air. So God bless.
