# Geno Smith Is Perfect for the Seahawks | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [October 31, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPlrRcUg5lo)
*  39th pick in 2013, possible MVP of the 2022 season, Geno Smith.
*  Yeah.
*  So when people say the Jets can't draft quarterbacks, they drafted Geno Smith, who is an MVP candidate
*  and is in the running for best quarterback in the NFC.
*  And they drafted him.
*  They had him.
*  But he was eight and eight with the Jets, wasn't he?
*  That one year.
*  And then the fight and it just was like circumstance.
*  He went to the Giants.
*  He got buried behind Eli.
*  Then he was basically Russell Wilson's backup.
*  He did have one of those.
*  It's almost like when I remember when we were John Ham, when we knew John Ham before Madmen.
*  And it was like, oh, that's Jennifer's boyfriend.
*  Oh, he's an actor.
*  It's like, oh, cool.
*  And then he's got this show, Madmen.
*  It's like, oh, that sounds cool.
*  That's great.
*  And then he turned into John Ham.
*  Geno, like he's like the fucking John Ham of of QB is bounced around for 10 years.
*  We're going to see him sidling up next to flow and the progressive ads.
*  I could see it.
*  You know, should have some progressive ad.
*  Yeah.
*  See your voice.
*  Let's hear your voice, you know, I like rooting for that team, especially when they're playing
*  the Giants, but they're a lot of fun and they play defense.
*  They know that defense allowed one touchdown today.
*  They won.
*  I think they've had two games with one touchdown and one with two in the last four.
*  Like they really they really play D. They got the fans back.
*  Talk about fans.
*  Oh, the Rams must look at that and be like, what the hell?
*  We'll never come close to that.
*  But at least that place is loud and you know what you're getting every week out of those
*  fans.
*  And and then you got Canine, Kenny Walker, the third great pick up.
*  Great pick up.
*  The most unorthodox runner in the league, except for the guy on Washington, the Walker
*  Robinson.
*  Yeah, he's got this herky jerky starter start game and he has the ball in the wrong hand
*  like two thirds of the time.
*  Like the touchdown he had today, he's running right to left with the ball in his right hand
*  as he tried to tackle him.
*  But he gets by everybody.
*  He's like I like a legit weapon.
*  They got two good receivers and locket stunk today.
*  And there is this moment when they came out of commercial and Gino was coming over just
*  trying to pull locket back in because like that a big fumble.
*  He dropped a touchdown, hit his helmet and they go over and they showed Gino just trying
*  to like kind of bring him back in like a real leader.
*  And I was like, oh, this is a nice moment.
*  This isn't like a Russell Wilson.
*  I know the guys are on me moment.
*  This is just I need to get this guy back.
*  We have a chance to win this game.
*  I'll tell you this.
*  I was going to bet see out all week.
*  I was like I was afraid of the Giants because they've just over week after week, they pull
*  games out of their ass fourth quarter.
*  You think you have it.
*  They do something.
*  And I was like, I think this can go down to two and a half and never did it.
*  Stayed at three.
*  And I stayed away.
*  And I was so mad because Seattle, Seattle's home field is just with this team and Gino
*  not making mistakes.
*  They're going to be a really hard team to play as we head into November, December,
*  January.
*  I agree.
*  And you know, that whole thing, I saw it too.
*  Gino coming over to the sideline.
*  I'm like, is this another thing where the young quarterback goes to the guy who's been
*  around a while and that's like, oh, wait a minute.
*  Gino's been playing quarterback since 1984.
*  NFL.
*  This is this actually makes sense.
*  So you're right.
*  There's that leadership, not annoying leadership quality versus what you're exactly right.
*  What Russ offers Denver.
*  And you know, that team is pissed.
*  They won because now it's just knee high knees in the aisles for the next 10 weeks on every
*  flight. It's going to be awful for them.
*  Well, after the game, Tyler Lockett said.
*  It's amazing what we can accomplish when no one cares who gets the credit.
*  Just the fucking drive-bys at Russ are unbelievable.
*  Like, there's guys like Sherman and and Marshawn and people like that that are just, you know,
*  they're they're just coming out and firing bullets.
*  And then there's like all the stuff like that.
*  A lot of I didn't realize I think this seat, those diehard Seattle fans kind of knew, but
*  they didn't want to admit it.
*  But I didn't realize how how dysfunctional the rest thing was.
*  I think it was I think it was way worse than we thought.
*  And then it was like Pete's holding Russ back.
*  It's like, is he? Yeah, this is the kind of team Pete wanted to coach.
*  I can't believe I think like just dozens of guys were waiting for him to lose.
*  Right. It's like, oh, man, why do we tolerate this?
*  We've all worked with people like this.
*  But yeah, he is productive.
*  I can see why they keep him around.
*  He's a good earner.
*  Wait a minute. He can't he can't complete a pass over the middle.
*  All right. OK, let's start talking.
*  We should this guy off.
*  Yeah. Well, Gino, for the season, one one oh seven QB rating,
*  13 TDs, three picks.
*  He's thrown for almost 2000 yards and he leads the league in completion
*  percentage, which can be a bogus stat from time to time.
*  But you have the combo of they're getting big plays.
*  He's not he's protecting the ball, which was a problem with him in the past.
*  And he keeps the chains moving.
*  And I don't know. I think it's a legitimate team.
*  I I feel like he throws downfield.
*  I know he's in the 70s for completion percentage, but it's not a Drew Brees type.
*  It's not a yard check down to Kamara.
*  You know, it's he throws downfield a lot.
*  He does the thing that Kyle and I are just going nuts about with Mac.
*  Like just every once in a while, three step drop.
*  Just try to get your receiver to make a play.
*  Just throw it downfield.
*  Just put it in the air.
*  Let your guy go up and get something.
*  They have locket and they have and they have makeup.
*  So they're over under for the season was five and a half.
*  They were 50 to one on Fandel to win the division.
*  They were 71 to win the conference.
*  They were plus 540 to win the playoffs before the season.
*  And I don't remember whether we went over.
*  Oh, I guess I went I went over on that one.
*  I don't remember what you did.
*  They have next games.
*  They're at Arizona, at Tampa, right?
*  Vegas versus the versus.
*  Yeah, I think they're home for Tampa.
*  Yeah. Oh, actually, that's a that Tampa's away.
*  Yeah, that's a German. Yeah.
*  And then they still have they have another San Francisco game.
*  They have a Kansas City game at Kansas City on Christmas Eve.
*  And that's going to be exciting, that 49ers game in Seattle, December 15th.
*  That's a night game, too. That's going to be fun.
*  Yeah, I think they get it.
*  I think they're going to get the 10 wins, don't you?
*  Yeah, I do. They may only need nine for that division,
*  but I think they get to 10.
*  They're a fun team.
*  And yeah, listen, as a Cowboys fan, I know we're probably if we don't win
*  the division, much, much, much rather go to Atlanta and even Tampa,
*  who beat us than I would Seattle in the playoffs.
*  Right. So how I laid that out for you.
*  If you're the top wild card, assuming you can't beat Philly.
*  I would guess you're going to play the NFC South, whoever comes out of there.
*  So would you rather go to Tampa, Atlanta, New Orleans or Carolina?
*  Oh, just out of those four.
*  Yeah, you'd rather go to Carolina, but they're not they're probably not going to make it.
*  That's the four or five.
*  I, you know, if Michael Parsons can't figure out Marcus Mariota,
*  then something's wrong.
*  I'm sorry. And I know you hate that game and I don't know when you want to talk about it.
*  But stupid, another stupid win for the Falcons.
*  Let's talk about it now.
*  Just to put a bow on put a bow on Gino.
*  Yeah, I think he's like the king of Seattle right now.
*  Hall of Fame. I think he's like the most popular guy in Seattle.
*  Like, how do you not love that story? Love that guy.
*  You trade Russ away. You get this hall back.
*  You get Gino in his place.
*  This incredible redemption story.
*  What's a better story than that? Tim and Julio Rodriguez.
*  Yeah, you're right. Exactly.
*  It's got to be those two in the sun and whatever the Sonics come back.
*  I don't know what is he get comeback player of the year or there's no more.
*  He has to wait.
*  He does like create a new award for him.
*  Create the Gino Smith.
*  I thought you were dead award and give it to Gino Smith.
*  It's too early. They didn't renew the odds, but they refreshed the odds.
*  But yeah, I think he passed Barkley today in terms of being at the top
*  of the leaderboard there for comeback player.
*  Well, you and I are old enough to remember like this.
*  Bigger versions of this Jim Plunkett,
*  number one pick for the Patriots overall 1970
*  gets the shit kicked out of him for six years, ends up getting waved, goes to Niners.
*  Oh, no, they traded Niners gets waved,
*  ends up on the Raiders, ends up in a couple of Super Bowls.
*  Right. That's like the best one.
*  There was a mini test of Verity Redemption
*  where he was on the Browns, then Parcells loved them, had them on the Jets for a while.
*  This is probably closer to test of Verity,
*  but still considering like he never had a moment and he was never a number one pick.
*  And even heading into the the the preseason, it was like,
*  it's going to be him or Drew Locke.
*  And nobody was like, that's crazy.
*  How is it not Gino Smith?
*  Because he'd never really done anything.
*  And don't forget, they beat Denver that first week. Right.
*  And it's like, oh, that's good. That's funny.
*  I get a kick out of this.
*  It did, you know, it's comes all the Russ lovers and the Denver
*  lovers down for a minute.
*  Then they lost it next to.
*  So it's like, all right, this is the rebuilding team we knew.
*  Then they got back going again. Fun team for sure.
