# The Talented Dolphins and the Same Old Chargers | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo)
*  Tyreek was the best guy in any game today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=0.0s)]
*  He was unbelievable. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  And I know people are like, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=6.08s)]
*  oh yeah, 215 yards, two TDs. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=7.28s)]
*  That almost didn't capture what was going on in that game. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=9.16s)]
*  Every time they needed a play, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=11.56s)]
*  we kept looking, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Hinch came over for the late games with me and Kyle, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=14.36s)]
*  and every time we looked at that TV, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=17.04s)]
*  Tyreek was just wide open in the middle of the field [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  with nobody within like six yards of him. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=21.32s)]
*  And we were saying like, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=23.2s)]
*  how great of an athlete does somebody have to be [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=24.68s)]
*  when you're playing at the highest level of football [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=26.72s)]
*  and you're still just wide open seven times? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=29.2s)]
*  Then he makes the big catch to set up the winning drive. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  And then he makes this touchdown catch to win the game [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=35.2s)]
*  that the guys draped all over him. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  It was a perfect throw by Tua. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=39.96s)]
*  And yet again, we had a Chargers choke, right? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I'm bummed out because on Cousins Sal's [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=45.04s)]
*  winning weekend on Fandol TV, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  we go over all the games. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=50.599999999999994s)]
*  And this week I had Harry on and we ran out of time. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=52.0s)]
*  Otherwise I had Tyreek Hill for two or more touchdowns [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  to plus 550, but we ran out. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=58.32s)]
*  Harry ate the tie. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  He actually literally ate all the time. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=60.96s)]
*  He's that hungry. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  So I love that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=63.6s)]
*  And I'm gonna change my tune on Tua. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=65.36s)]
*  Like I still don't know what the rules and everything, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  how long he's gonna last, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=70.92s)]
*  but as long as he's in there, he's so much fun to watch. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=72.0s)]
*  He's so great to watch. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=75.76s)]
*  I'm not like I should just be recognizing this, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  but 466 yards and three touchdowns [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=79.68s)]
*  and just sipping it in there to all different guys. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=82.56s)]
*  And that game was the most fun for the day. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=84.92s)]
*  I have no question about it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=88.44s)]
*  Yeah, we were saying it was almost like an arena game. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=89.28s)]
*  It just seemed like anybody who had the ball, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=92.52s)]
*  they could just get 20, 30, 40 yards a pop. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  Tua was great. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=97.0s)]
*  The biggest thing to me at the end of the game [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=99.11999999999999s)]
*  was the Chargers, the Dolphins missed an extra point. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=101.6s)]
*  So the Dolphins, they take the lead. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=104.6s)]
*  Oh my God, we did it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=106.84s)]
*  Came from behind and they missed the extra point. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=108.52s)]
*  And there's like two minutes left. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=111.19999999999999s)]
*  And it's just like, oh, I've seen this before. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=113.32s)]
*  Now the Chargers are good at score. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  But it's the Chargers. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=118.56s)]
*  So you kind of, I've also seen them [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=119.4s)]
*  completely blow the situation. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=121.48s)]
*  And the Dolphins, they just took over that last drive. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=123.2s)]
*  I think, did they have two sacks or three? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=125.84s)]
*  But they were like, you know, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=127.88s)]
*  the Chargers are going backwards, backwards. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=129.36s)]
*  And they basically eviscerated them. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=131.4s)]
*  I picked the Dolphins to win the AFCs before the year [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=134.48s)]
*  because I thought they had the most talent. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=139.2s)]
*  And it's gonna come down to can they get [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=141.72s)]
*  four months out of Tua? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=144.0s)]
*  But I do think they have the most talent. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=144.88s)]
*  You watch Wado and Hill together. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=146.6s)]
*  Most of it looked fast today, I thought. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=149.04s)]
*  They didn't even have their rookie running back [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=151.52s)]
*  that they thought they were gonna have as a backup. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=153.72s)]
*  But they just have so much speed. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=155.28s)]
*  And I think that's gonna end up being the best team [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=157.4s)]
*  in that division, unless he goes down again. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=159.48s)]
*  That's the whole thing. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=163.68s)]
*  Because Mike White does not have a lot of talent. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=164.52s)]
*  He'll do some other things. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=166.88s)]
*  He'll beat the Bengals once in a while or something like that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=168.16s)]
*  But so that's it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=170.8s)]
*  And I hate betting that way. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=172.52s)]
*  Like, no, no, no, this team's gonna be bad eventually [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  because this guy's gonna get hurt. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=177.07999999999998s)]
*  I hate that. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=177.92s)]
*  The thing I'm the most happy about [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=178.76s)]
*  that I didn't get involved with was the Chargers. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=181.56s)]
*  Because to me, it's same old Chargers. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=183.56s)]
*  It just is. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  They had no home field advantage, which we knew. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=187.0s)]
*  They cut to these Miami scoring touchdowns. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=189.64s)]
*  They're cutting to entire sections of Dolphin fans. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=191.72s)]
*  Then we have to hear about how unstoppable [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=195.44s)]
*  and great this Chargers offense is. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=198.12s)]
*  And they do have stretches where they look awesome. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  But when they needed to put together a 40-yard drive [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=202.44s)]
*  at the end of the game to kick a field goal, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=205.36s)]
*  they just went backwards. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=206.84s)]
*  And I just don't trust the coach. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=208.4s)]
*  And I don't believe in them. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0TCyg4TDo&t=210.76000000000002s)]
