# Way-Too-Early NFL Playoff Predictions | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 26, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rF3rlaafZ8)
*  I wrote down, I was like, do I like seven teams right now?
*  I wrote down Buffalo, Philly, Jacksonville, Green Bay and Tampa.
*  Cause I still think Tampa's D and they'll get their receivers back.
*  They're fine.
*  Baltimore, just cause it feels like Lamar might be putting together something
*  special and then either Miami or KC for that last spot.
*  And I don't, I don't know how that one plays out yet.
*  The lack of firepower.
*  I didn't like my homes yelling at the enemy today.
*  Combined with the lack of firepower made me nervous.
*  That just didn't feel like they had the swagger.
*  Yeah.
*  Well he needs to settle into a receiver at this point, right?
*  Well, I guess it's only three weeks, but, um, you know, let's, you get excited
*  about like a Valdez scantling, you know, like, oh, that's not, that's not the answer.
*  Um, he can't be happy with these guys, right?
*  The guys weren't open.
*  It was like, we were watching the Vegas game and Adams had like 30,000
*  yards, had like 35 yards, 35 yards or less twice in three games, which has
*  happened, happened like only a couple of times in his career in green bag.
*  But when you actually watch the game, it didn't seem like he was open that much.
*  It didn't really seem like all of these vaunted Vegas targets were open.
*  And the same thing for KC.
*  I didn't really feel like there was one play where Schuster got open and
*  he went for like 50 yards, but for the most part, it felt like the guys
*  were covered all over the place.
*  I mean, it's all around, it's an epidemic.
*  Like look at Jamar chase, right?
*  Like that guy can't get open.
*  My guy, see lamb can't get open.
*  There's a, I'm not sure.
*  Um, they didn't change the rules.
*  Did they?
*  Well, the defense is just like stepping up or is it too hot out?
*  They're like, is it all these factors that, that amount to like, what seems
*  like a touchdown less per game?
*  Chris, a lot of that got open.
*  He did a bunch of targets today.
*  Yeah.
*  The, uh, the Vegas game, they were one for 12 on third down.
*  Wow.
*  Our friend Hatch gleefully texted this because him and I have complained a
*  lot about McDaniel's the last few years and he McDaniel's is now five and
*  20 in his last 25 games closed door meeting with Al Davis after the game.
*  A long one.
*  They said out there, out there.
*  They exhumed him.
*  How did they find out?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  That's it.
*  That's the punishment.
*  You have to be with Al Davis.
*  No, they wrote that dug them up.
*  Yeah.
*  No, Mark Davis.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So there's two winless teams yet.
*  Vegas left Vegas and Houston and Houston has a tie.
*  So Vegas is the only own three team left in the entire league.
*  I know, but they're good.
*  I know I'm with you.
*  I'm an idiot.
*  I picked them to be in first place in the West, but they, they, you don't
*  want to say should be three and all, but they're in every game.
*  They're just one of these jackass teams that can't get it together.
*  I don't think.
*  Well, where did this Hollins guy come from that was catching everything today?
*  Mack Hollins.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know how much you're betting on them in a, in a, in a, in a, in a, in a,
*  did you see when they got the touchdown that brought them to within two and then
*  they missed the two point, but it was like fourth and 10 and they just like,
*  they just threw it over to him.
*  He was blanketed and he just did like the Calvin Johnson.
*  All right.
*  I'll just catch this right.
*  It came back hanging all over me.
*  It was really nice.
*  Yeah.
*  He'll go for like $40 in our league.
*  He has as many as many targets as, uh, the Monte Adams today.
*  You make a good point about Vegas.
*  It's weird.
*  They're oh, and three and I'm not totally panicking for really anybody yet.
*  Because even you look at the parody, you look at the standings and like everybody's
*  two and one or one and two.
*  So how can you even be out of it?
*  I mean, I'm, uh, I'm biased because like I said, I had very high hopes for him and
*  my money followed those high hopes, but I think they're better than several to win
*  teams.
*  Like I think they're better than Cleveland.
*  Uh, they're bet.
*  They're definitely better than the bears.
*  I don't, I don't, I don't know what would happen.
*  Um, we'll see what the giants.
*  Um, I don't know.
*  And then, uh, and Denver, they play Denver next week.
*  I think they're better than them.
*  Well, let's do AFC teams.
*  Yeah.
*  Like just if you had to say, making the playoffs, we have no idea.
*  It's week three, a million things can change, but I'd put Miami and Buffalo in
*  there.
*  Um, one of the AFC West teams, Jacksonville and probably Baltimore.
*  And I think there's a bunch of spots.
*  There's two wild card spots open.
*  And technically you could argue the AFC West is open because the chargers are
*  having this season from hell.
*  It's not there yet, but it's starting to edge towards season from hell
*  possibilities with them.
*  Like both the limps off with the groin injury in the first quarter.
*  Alan's already missed two games.
*  Guyton looked like he's something terrible happened to him today.
*  It looked like it was an Achilles or something.
*  The coach and the doctor are trying to kill the star quarterback.
*  He's like JPM Lee Curtis and Halloween.
*  And, uh, and Staley see below 500 now as a coach or 500.
*  What were they last year?
*  Nine, nine and eight.
*  Right there.
*  They were nine and eight, right?
*  Yeah.
*  So he's 500.
*  They went 10 games.
*  They might've won 10.
*  Uh, Oh no, they didn't make the playoffs, right?
*  Yeah.
*  They, I think they were nine and eight.
*  And then on the other side, Philly, Green Bay, well, but back to the AFC, like
*  it's weird that we're three weeks in and we're like, yeah, there's only going
*  to be one AFC West team, but I think you're right.
*  Out of, out of Denver, the Raiders and the chargers, but I guess,
*  there might be, but one of those has to win 10 games.
*  I don't know if the 10 and seven.
*  I think Miami and Buffalo, unless something stupid happens, I think
*  those are both playoff teams.
*  I was really impressed by Miami's defense today, even though I know
*  they gave up 90 plays and Buffalo left a lot on the table, but I
*  thought they pressured Alan.
*  I thought they made him, they made him work.
*  I thought they did a pretty good job of covering the receivers.
*  Um, it was okay.
*  Like they were doing a lot of gimmick stuff, a lot of blitzing.
*  Um, but they, they hung around, they gave themselves a, yeah, they
*  handled the heat for 90 plays.
*  That's, that's, uh, commendable.
*  Yeah.
*  And then on the NFC side, even if you put the Eagles in, let's say Green Bay,
*  Tampa, I don't even know who you're taking out of the NFC West, maybe the Rams,
*  but it's like the Rams have shown a ton.
*  I like the way Carolina is playing.
*  I know I'm in on them every week, but I think their defense is good.
*  Their defense was really good again today.
*  Uh, they, they're, I think that's one of those teams.
*  When the advanced metrics start coming, like really start to get
*  good around week six, week seven.
*  I think that's going to be a team that's going to be like in the top 10 or 12 by
*  all these different numbers and people are like, boy, that's weird.
*  Why is Carolina in there?
*  But I, they're in all, they easily could be three and oh.
*  Listen, I'm not going to argue with you.
*  They, they, um, the saints score and then they come right back.
*  Like Baker, like that, that was an important drive for them.
*  Right.
*  Cause you don't want them to be, if they're all in three, we're not
*  having this conversation.
*  They have a bunch of playmakers on D too.
*  And they can, they seem like no matter how shaky Baker looks from game to game,
*  they're always get like two plays.
*  They get like two long plays and McCaffrey's made it three games without getting hurt.
*  Yeah.
*  To me, the Minnesota looks fraudulent.
*  And then I think tomorrow we'll find out with your team because your
*  team should beat the giants tomorrow.
*  I think so too.
*  I'm not a giant should not go three and oh, oddly confident.
*  Yeah.
*  I really am because the giant fans are really, really confident.
*  We were talking to Schrager is like even the cops in the area walking with a
*  swagger and everything like, yeah, all right.
*  This is where we pounce here.
*  But, uh, you know, the Eagles and bucks are tied now odds wise to win the NFC.
*  Just like that.
*  Makes sense.
*  I think the Eagles, every game, like the box lost today.
*  I know, but their defense is really good and they were missing their top three
*  receivers.
*  Yeah.
*  I know there's three plus 30, uh, point differential teams, Buffalo's plus 53,
*  Jacksonville's plus 46 and Philly's plus 36.
*  And you think like, if Wentz doesn't hit two bombs in that Jacksonville game, he
*  needed to hit both Jacksonville's three and up.
*  And we're like, holy shit is Jacksonville.
*  Are we going to get Buffalo and Jacksonville in the, uh, in the finals?
