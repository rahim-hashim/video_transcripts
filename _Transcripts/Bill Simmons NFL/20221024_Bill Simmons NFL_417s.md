# A Bad Farewell Season for Tom Brady? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [October 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpCfs6VKMBs)
*  This Brady season, I was thinking about all these different farewell seasons.
*  Yeah, I think Ali, we were old enough to remember Ali Holmes, which sports
*  illustrated did the cover and there was no words on it.
*  It was just Ali and the stool with like a black guy, just like completely dead
*  inside. And that's to me a 10 out of 10 on how bad a farewell year can go.
*  Right.
*  Barry Bonds was a good one where everybody basically put their hands up
*  and they said, we're not signing you.
*  It's like, really?
*  AL team, you don't want this guy's at the age who had like a 480 on base last year.
*  No, we're all out.
*  We're blind out.
*  So that's a bad way for it then.
*  You have those things like OJ on the Niners, Emmett Smith on the Cardinals.
*  But when the guy has the last year of his career uniform and it's just kind of sad.
*  Patrick Gilliam was on Seattle, shit like that.
*  And it's like, so you think no matter what, this is it.
*  This is well, I'm going through all the scenarios.
*  Farve second.
*  This is definitely his last year far that second Viking season when his body fell apart.
*  Kareem and the Lakers when they made the finals, but he was like bald,
*  kind of like weird body Kareem.
*  Like he just wasn't Kareem anymore.
*  Iverson's last two NBA years were horrible.
*  Murray Lemieux came back.
*  He played for like five more years.
*  Sure.
*  On the Penguins.
*  Remember that?
*  They didn't make the playoffs.
*  He wasn't Lemieux anymore.
*  There's all these different ways it can go.
*  I think that LeBron's could be pretty bad too.
*  He could be.
*  I know, but he's at least still good at basketball.
*  Like he could still put up 30 points.
*  Like Brady seems dead inside, super skinny, bad luck all over the place.
*  He's getting divorced and I think it's finalized is the word in the street.
*  Everything about this has been like, wow, I wish I hadn't come back,
*  but we have 10 games to go.
*  And I've just never, I've never seen a farewell season like this, I guess is my point of view.
*  Like, rack your brain.
*  Have you thought, have you seen anything this weird?
*  This is the most famous player in the history of the sport.
*  No, I agree with you.
*  There's a ton of distractions and, you know, obviously sitting out a week and he took shit
*  for that in the preseason.
*  And then, you know, I think going to Robert Kraft's wedding, he's like, wow, this guy
*  found true love.
*  Why can't I do it?
*  Why can't I look at this couple?
*  But no, but honestly, I don't, I don't know.
*  Should we give Bruce Arians a little more credit?
*  I don't want to give him too much credit because he had the crazy old man vibe towards the end.
*  We were starting, it was looking like he was going to beat up his own players.
*  So I understand why they had to get him out of there.
*  Yeah, yeah, a little bit.
*  But, but did he make, did he keep things in line in order a little bit?
*  Maybe I don't know that he had all that influence over Brady, but it didn't hurt.
*  That's for sure.
*  The, the play calling is awful.
*  And I, like I saw left, which was trending on Twitter and I thought maybe he got into
*  it with Mike Evans or somebody.
*  So I, I clicked on it and like, what'd he do?
*  And it was just, it was just Bucks fans complaining about left, which for like hundreds of tweets
*  in a row of like, we suck.
*  We run the worst offense in the league.
*  So I don't know.
*  I saw that drop by Evans and I was like, oh, that's, but he's going to get open 45 times
*  and there's going to be a blowout.
*  It just never happened again.
*  They just couldn't get it going again.
*  Then they kicked the field goal down 14, nothing stupid.
*  That was weird.
*  They played Baltimore on Thursday night when we'll do guest alliance.
*  We'll talk about that.
*  They play one of the LA teams on week nine.
*  I assume that's the Rams.
*  Oh no, that's the Chargers.
*  No, yeah.
*  Home for the Chargers.
*  Then they have a London game.
*  No, I think it's Germany actually, or Germany week 10.
*  They're playing Seattle.
*  Does Brady leave the country?
*  I could see him being like, you know what?
*  I'm gonna skip this one.
*  I don't, I don't feel like going away.
*  Either doesn't leave or it doesn't return one of the two.
*  Right.
*  But that's the thing with this Brady season.
*  Like, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I feel like he's moved into the Tyson zone.
*  Yeah.
*  Like if a story came out on that Monday, it was like Tom Brady has decided not
*  to go to Germany.
*  He's going to wait and he'll be again.
*  He'll rejoin the team next week when they return to America.
*  I wouldn't be surprised, would you?
*  I guess not, but also he's all right.
*  Let me play devil's advocate.
*  He's in first place.
*  They're not going to get a buy, but he could probably, what'd you say?
*  There were minus 500 still for first place.
*  Like,
*  No, they're minus 270.
*  It's at least on Fandl.
*  That's not a slam dunk.
*  They could stay at 500.
*  They could stay in first place.
*  Because the other thing is where is he going?
*  If things are not good with the wife, like at least with football, you get to yell at
*  300 pound men and throw a computer like tablets all around.
*  And it's the only place where it's acceptable.
*  I'm going to be able to do this anywhere else.
*  So I don't know.
*  I don't know if you could have distractions.
*  I don't think you can have distractions like this as a quarterback is my take.
*  Like you think about like how his life was carefully constructed the last like what?
*  10, 12 years post ACL surgery as he gravitated toward TB 12 and the diet and he's fucking
*  making avocado ice cream and every piece of his life is just carefully thought out.
*  And now it's like in complete flux.
*  Everything is different.
*  And I think it's definitely screwed him up.
*  I don't, I was taught, we talked last week.
*  He just doesn't seem like Brady on the TV.
*  He says he makes a call to grump.
*  I mean, we've said this and they've hinted that it's not going to happen,
*  but that might be what salvages this whole thing.
*  After everything, a few people have made this point.
*  It's just like that, not the type of team that he normally succeeds with.
*  Like he loves throwing over the middle, right?
*  Who do you trust over the middle other than maybe Godwin?
*  Yeah.
*  No, they, who's like the James White on this team.
*  They don't really have one.
*  They did a poor job of constructing the team.
*  And I think the play calling has been pretty bad too, but this,
*  this Thursday night spot is brutal, right?
*  They've four days rest to play Baltimore.
*  I think Lamar is like the hardest guy to prepare for in the week.
*  Like he really, he ate up the Patriots a few weeks ago.
*  He's not even playing well last few weeks, but to just have four days to prepare for that dude.
*  Well, yeah, I don't understand this defense.
*  Like, you know, whether it's a quarterback running or, you know,
*  Dr. Freeman and Chuba Hubbard had what they have like 180 yards combined rush.
*  That's the one thing you could never do against Tampa,
*  a healthy Tampa defense and Vita Bay is run against them.
*  So it didn't matter.
*  They didn't score any points this week.
*  Yeah, I thought, I thought they'd be better with bowls and they're just, they're just not.
