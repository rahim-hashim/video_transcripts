# The Villain Chiefs, Tom Brady’s 1st TV Year + More Super Bowl Takeaways | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI)
*  Hey, news flash, the Cowboys didn't win another Super Bowl. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=0.0s)]
*  It's been over three decades since the last time. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=3.48s)]
*  We did have the Eagles win. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=7.12s)]
*  We had the end of Mahomes. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=8.28s)]
*  We had a lot of takes. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  Sal and I were doing stuff on Sunday night about, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=11.36s)]
*  Mahomes getting kicked off Cote Island. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=14.32s)]
*  What was the media reaction yesterday? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=17.0s)]
*  What jumped out to you? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=19.12s)]
*  What did you enjoy? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think we had a little bit of a chiefs take crisis [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=21.64s)]
*  with the Super Bowl before the game. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=24.64s)]
*  We did. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=27.16s)]
*  Did you see all the people trying to make the chiefs [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=28.0s)]
*  into villains like the Pats, like the 90s Yankees? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=29.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=34.36s)]
*  And they're not villains. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=35.2s)]
*  They're just not. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=37.160000000000004s)]
*  They're not hated on that scale yet, I don't believe. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=38.0s)]
*  And people try to, you know, oh, we're tired of them. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=41.24s)]
*  We're pissed off at Taylor Swift. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  The refs are in their pocket. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=46.32s)]
*  And they were just trying to get us there [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=48.36s)]
*  that we all hated the chiefs and we're rooting against them. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=50.08s)]
*  But I don't actually believe that was the case. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=53.28s)]
*  I think we might be a little tired of them being good. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=54.88s)]
*  We might've been kind of annoyed [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=57.76s)]
*  at the way they won games this year, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=59.08s)]
*  but I don't think they're hated at all. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=60.76s)]
*  And then my favorite bill was you got to- [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=63.2s)]
*  Wait, hold on on that though. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=64.64s)]
*  Who was the best, who was central casting for best villain? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=65.72s)]
*  Was it just Duke basketball in the 90s? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=70.72s)]
*  Who was just the easiest to put right in there? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that could've been- [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=75.92s)]
*  Because even the Yankees, like, I hated the Yankees, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  but I was like, all right, Jeter, I kind of like, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=79.4s)]
*  he seems like a nice guy. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=81.24s)]
*  You know, there was, it was more the fan base [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=82.48s)]
*  than the team itself. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=85.24s)]
*  Duke basketball seemed like that was the easiest one. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=86.4s)]
*  Duke was at the top of the scale. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=89.0s)]
*  The Yankees had the thing where they were [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=90.36s)]
*  outspending everybody and kind of everybody [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=91.72s)]
*  thought they were ruining baseball. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=94.12s)]
*  So I think that was mixed in there. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=95.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, when you're ruining stuff, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=97.32s)]
*  that's always a good one. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=99.16s)]
*  I'm trying to think who else. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=100.44s)]
*  Like the Pats, because of the Spygate, I felt like that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=101.36s)]
*  In the first three Super Bowls, people were like, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=105.68s)]
*  all right, enough with these guys. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=107.68s)]
*  But it was a little like the chiefs thing. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=109.0s)]
*  But then when Spygate happened, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=110.32s)]
*  then they became criminals basically, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=111.72s)]
*  and that moved it to another level. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=113.92s)]
*  And then they had a hateable coach, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  which is another thing the chiefs lacked. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  Like people don't hate Andy Reid. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=119.04s)]
*  They just don't. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=121.28s)]
*  Bill Belichick was hateable, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=122.16000000000001s)]
*  probably still is hateable in his own way, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=123.88000000000001s)]
*  even as he's tried to rehabilitate his image all year. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=125.92s)]
*  But I think with the chiefs, people were just like, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=128.72s)]
*  ah, okay. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=130.56s)]
*  They had the Taylor Swift thing, a lot of Kelsey, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=131.88s)]
*  a lot of both Kelsies. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=134.6s)]
*  A lot of commercials. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=136.20000000000002s)]
*  They were moving a little bit toward the Trump side of stuff, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  which I think a couple of people ruffled up. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=140.72s)]
*  But for the most part, I don't know. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=143.96s)]
*  My biggest issue with them was they made it so unfun [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=146.72s)]
*  to talk about the Super Bowl, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=150.04s)]
*  which we talked about on Saturday night, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=151.36s)]
*  where it's just like, if you pick them, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=152.76s)]
*  you kind of feel it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=155.0s)]
*  You just say, ah, Andy Reid's my home. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=155.84s)]
*  You had no other reason. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=157.76s)]
*  If you didn't pick them, you felt like an idiot. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=159.08s)]
*  So it was, I think, the worst Super Bowl to talk about [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  since I've been doing this. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=165.0s)]
*  I think so, but I, like you, talk myself into, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=166.96s)]
*  the chiefs are gonna win it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=170.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=171.36s)]
*  I'm like, what's this game? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  It was the first time I ever got slaughtered on a Super Bowl [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  and didn't feel bad really at all. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=176.72s)]
*  I was like, what are you gonna do? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  You can't go get some game. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=179.6s)]
*  What was the other thing you were gonna say [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=180.67999999999998s)]
*  about the villain thing? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=181.92s)]
*  Well, I was just saying, like, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=183.2s)]
*  once the villain thing kind of didn't work out, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  that you heard this amazing take on ESPN and elsewhere, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=186.6s)]
*  people said, don't be tired of the chiefs. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=189.04s)]
*  Appreciate greatness when it's in front of you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=191.83999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=194.48s)]
*  And I was like, what a counterintuitive take. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=195.32s)]
*  You should appreciate a great football team. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=197.32s)]
*  Whoa, whoa. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=199.39999999999998s)]
*  Good tack. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=201.4s)]
*  Go settle down, guys. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=202.24s)]
*  What was it like as a TV viewer [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=204.56s)]
*  for the Brady Mahomes experience? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=206.36s)]
*  Brady announcing the game where Mahomes' goat resume [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=208.6s)]
*  got knocked backwards by about four years. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=211.8s)]
*  So it was a little bit weird, right? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=213.84s)]
*  First of all, Brady actually got to go [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=216.84s)]
*  to the meetings this week, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=218.56s)]
*  and apparently I was told there was a scene [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=220.24s)]
*  in one of the meetings where he and Mahomes [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=222.32s)]
*  were just sitting off by themselves talking. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=223.84s)]
*  Oh. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  And people in the meeting, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=227.88s)]
*  Fox producer was like, look at that. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=228.76s)]
*  I mean, that's kind of awesome, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=230.67999999999998s)]
*  these two dudes just talking football. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=231.88s)]
*  It was one of those moments where you're like, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  whoa, goat plus goat, well, almost goat, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=235.83999999999997s)]
*  talking to each other about football. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=239.44s)]
*  But then it gets to the game, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=241.44s)]
*  and Mahomes just sucks at the beginning of the game. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=242.27999999999997s)]
*  He was terrible. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=244.83999999999997s)]
*  You nailed this on Sunday night. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=245.72s)]
*  So Brady, I thought, never got to talk about [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=247.72s)]
*  Mahomes' greatness in an interesting way. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=252.35999999999999s)]
*  And at the same time, he kind of made a mistake [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=254.92s)]
*  because he didn't really kill Mahomes. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=256.56s)]
*  He was talking about how good the Eagles defense was. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=258.36s)]
*  Well, and that's where Romo, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=260.96s)]
*  probably Romo, but I think Aikman would have been the best [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=263.04s)]
*  because Aikman just doesn't give a shit anymore. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=265.84s)]
*  Aikman, I think probably would have been [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=267.71999999999997s)]
*  the hardest on him, right? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=269.08s)]
*  I think so. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=270.48s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=271.36s)]
*  One thing you could tell with Brady this year, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=272.2s)]
*  and this is kind of one of the most fascinating subplots [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=273.88s)]
*  of Brady announcer experiment, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=276.03999999999996s)]
*  was you could tell what quarterbacks he liked [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=277.68s)]
*  and what quarterbacks he didn't, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=279.88s)]
*  and what quarterbacks he thought didn't measure up. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=281.76s)]
*  Jalen Hurts, by the way, was in the second category. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=286.64s)]
*  Every Jalen Hurts game, he would say, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  Jalen Hurts is better when he gets the ball [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=289.72s)]
*  out of his hands quickly. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=291.92s)]
*  Yep, and he would get mad when he held it too long [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=293.32s)]
*  and got sacked or had to run out, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=296.08000000000004s)]
*  throw it out of bounds, Brady would be exasperated. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=298.08000000000004s)]
*  Which is a nice way of saying he's pretty limited, right? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=300.68s)]
*  He can do certain things, but he can't do other things. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=303.36s)]
*  Well, what happens during the Super Bowl? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=305.16s)]
*  Jalen Hurts kind of balls out. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  He plays better than Patrick Mahomes. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=307.64000000000004s)]
*  So you could feel Brady really processing that [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=309.72s)]
*  in real time, and he sort of got, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=313.04s)]
*  well, he has a great instinct [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=314.72s)]
*  on when to leave the pocket, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=316.6s)]
*  because he was beating all those rushes and blitzes, right, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=318.52000000000004s)]
*  by running, and he kind of got himself there. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=321.24s)]
*  And he gave Hurts his due. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=323.72s)]
*  I don't want to say he didn't do that, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=324.88s)]
*  but that was just funny to hear in real time. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=325.92s)]
*  Yeah, and it seems like after 48 hours, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=328.04s)]
*  the second level analysis stuff is, whoa, the Eagles, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=330.36s)]
*  actually, like go the 2000 Ravens [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=336.6s)]
*  and some of the other great Super Bowl teams, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=339.16s)]
*  where do they go, where do they rank ahead of them? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=341.48s)]
*  And then it feels like people are kind of test driving [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=344.2s)]
*  some Mahomes stuff. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=348.12s)]
*  And even people in my life where it's like, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=350.12s)]
*  are we sure? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=353.4s)]
*  Just because they pulled out all these close games, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=356.28s)]
*  like why don't they have explosive plays anymore? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=359.08s)]
*  The guy's about to hit 30. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=362.0s)]
*  Could you say he peaked a couple years ago [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=364.2s)]
*  just as an explosive, awesome quarterback? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  Like there's always all these excuses around him. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=368.64s)]
*  Are we sure? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  Which I remember hit Brady in the late 2000s too. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=371.96000000000004s)]
*  There was some are we sure stuff. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=374.96000000000004s)]
*  So I don't think anyone feels really committed to anything. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=376.24s)]
*  The biggest thing that shocked me, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=379.24s)]
*  and I feel like I say this every year, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=381.52000000000004s)]
*  and it feels like it's even, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=383.24s)]
*  it just speeds up by probably an hour every year. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=384.88s)]
*  But going back, we both loved like Sports Illustrated [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  in the 80s. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=389.56s)]
*  The Super Bowl would happen. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=390.88s)]
*  People would talk about it. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=392.64s)]
*  It would be on Sports Center for four straight days. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=393.64s)]
*  And then the Sports Illustrated will come out on Thursday [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=395.96000000000004s)]
*  with like the final statement of the game. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=398.24s)]
*  And then that started to shrink as the internet came [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=399.88s)]
*  and it kept shrinking. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=403.64s)]
*  It kept shrinking. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=405.12s)]
*  But even like when I was at ESPN, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=405.96s)]
*  Sal and I used to do like Monday afternoon recaps [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=407.32s)]
*  of the Super Bowl. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=409.88s)]
*  Then that became Monday mornings. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=411.0s)]
*  Then eventually we're just going immediately [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=412.4s)]
*  as fast as we could after the game. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=414.32s)]
*  And now it feels like the shelf life [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=416.36s)]
*  to discuss the Super Bowl is 18 hours? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=417.88s)]
*  Is it longer than that? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=423.28s)]
*  Like does anyone, even us leading the podcast [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=424.6s)]
*  with this today, I wanna do it [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=427.04s)]
*  because I love talking about all the ancillary stuff [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=428.4s)]
*  with you, but it's like, is it too late? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=430.84s)]
*  Is it too late to talk about the Super Bowl [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=432.64s)]
*  on a Tuesday morning? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=434.2s)]
*  I totally agree. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=435.76s)]
*  I watched the late Sports Center on Sunday night. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=436.59999999999997s)]
*  After I was, I think right before I listened to you. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=438.56s)]
*  And at that moment I was kinda like, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=440.96s)]
*  am I done with the Super Bowl? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=442.91999999999996s)]
*  Is this it? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=445.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=446.64s)]
*  Yeah, like we had a pod to do the next day, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=447.47999999999996s)]
*  but I was like, have I consumed everything [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=448.91999999999996s)]
*  I'm gonna consume about the Eagles beating the Chiefs? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=450.76s)]
*  And the answer was almost yes. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=454.67999999999995s)]
*  I think I had. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=456.47999999999996s)]
*  Because, I mean, here's the other part of that. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=457.4s)]
*  You just consume so much now. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=459.2s)]
*  I mean, you had to wait till Thursday with that essay, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=461.76s)]
*  I think, to get all the details and, you know, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=463.88s)]
*  what was Vic Fangio like in the locker room afterwards? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=465.67999999999995s)]
*  I mean, Sheel wrote that, you know, for us right away. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=468.35999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=471.32s)]
*  So in a way it was just all kinda there for us [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=472.15999999999997s)]
*  so we don't really need to wait. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=474.4s)]
*  And there's no like, nobody's parachuting in [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=475.79999999999995s)]
*  on like Monday at 3 p.m. with this amazing angle [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=479.71999999999997s)]
*  that nobody's thought of. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=483.4s)]
*  You kinda know what all the angles are gonna be [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=484.64s)]
*  by, you know, 10 p.m. on Sunday night. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=486.76s)]
*  PT. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=489.48s)]
*  I think the one exception was, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=490.32s)]
*  remember that year Peter King went [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=491.15999999999997s)]
*  and hung out with Tom Brady and Giselle? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=492.28s)]
*  Was it Montana up in the cabin like a week later? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=494.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=497.59999999999997s)]
*  It feels so old school now, but like, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=498.44s)]
*  yeah, we're with Brady and he's reflecting on the game [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=500.96s)]
*  and giving me like an hour. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=503.36s)]
*  That was, even that I don't think he would do anymore. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=505.15999999999997s)]
*  I actually felt like the halftime show [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=508.48s)]
*  and the Kendrick Drake stuff and how polarized [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=510.44s)]
*  in that show ended up being almost became more of a theme [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=514.76s)]
*  on Monday, at least on my text threads [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=518.08s)]
*  and the stuff I was reading. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=521.36s)]
*  It was more interesting to read how people [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=522.56s)]
*  were receiving stuff, the hidden meanings [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=525.16s)]
*  behind some of the stuff Kendrick did on the halftime [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=527.28s)]
*  and Serena being in it. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=530.3199999999999s)]
*  That one had these levels that kept getting revealed [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=532.0s)]
*  that used to be how the Super Bowl operated. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=534.4s)]
*  Totally, because what player are we talking about [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=536.64s)]
*  in the Super Bowl? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=538.6s)]
*  You know, nothing from the second half. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=539.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=541.64s)]
*  You know, maybe that Mahomes picked six, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=542.48s)]
*  which effectively ended the game in retrospect. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=543.48s)]
*  By the way, you mentioned the Mahomes takes. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=547.28s)]
*  I want to go there with you. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=549.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=550.48s)]
*  Because it feels like Mahomes will work himself into [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=551.32s)]
*  a nobody believes in me news cycle [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=553.64s)]
*  because just enough doubt, even if it's bullshit, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=557.9200000000001s)]
*  just enough doubt. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=560.9200000000001s)]
*  And also Bill, Jalen Hurts, think about this. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=562.16s)]
*  What were people talking about Sunday night, Monday morning? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=565.84s)]
*  The Eagles defense. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=568.24s)]
*  This was a win for the Eagles defense. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=569.36s)]
*  So Jalen Hurts both win the Super Bowl MVP [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=571.44s)]
*  and pull off the unprecedented double play [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=575.1600000000001s)]
*  of being a nobody believed in me guy. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=577.36s)]
*  Has that ever happened before? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=581.44s)]
*  Probably Brady, somewhere in the first three Super Bowls [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=583.5200000000001s)]
*  where it was all Belichick and all the defense [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=587.4000000000001s)]
*  and Brady was kind of the supporting character [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=589.6800000000001s)]
*  in a lot of ways. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=592.6800000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=594.1600000000001s)]
*  I think it would be the only other time [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=595.0s)]
*  I can remember that happening. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=595.84s)]
*  He was seen as a facilitator. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=597.1600000000001s)]
*  He was so good. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=599.12s)]
*  He was great. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=600.8399999999999s)]
*  I mean, they basically put the game in his hands [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=601.68s)]
*  and dared him to beat them. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=603.3599999999999s)]
*  And he did. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=604.76s)]
*  With the Mahomes stuff, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=606.8399999999999s)]
*  there's a couple of fun wrinkles that could come out. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=608.76s)]
*  He could go the NBA player route. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=611.28s)]
*  Like if this was LeBron and the Mahomes spot, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=615.5999999999999s)]
*  we'd already be getting the leaks about he needs more help. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=617.9599999999999s)]
*  They didn't find him anyone this year. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=621.76s)]
*  When Rashid Rice went out, they could have done this, that, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=624.04s)]
*  and the other thing. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=626.56s)]
*  They knew Kelsey was getting old. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=627.64s)]
*  They've got to do more. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=629.68s)]
*  He took less money. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=630.76s)]
*  They'd basically make him a victim. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=631.88s)]
*  Wait, I thought you were going to say he was secretly injured. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=634.52s)]
*  When you said LeBron, I thought I had a secret injury. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=636.8399999999999s)]
*  I would be another one too. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=638.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he had like a quad injury. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=640.4s)]
*  He couldn't push off his right foot. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=642.68s)]
*  Yeah, they'd be doing all that stuff. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=644.4s)]
*  But it kind of doesn't seem like Mahomes, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=646.3599999999999s)]
*  not only does he not do that stuff, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=648.92s)]
*  but he always seems at peace win or lose after the game. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=650.68s)]
*  We never see that stuff about, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=655.56s)]
*  oh, this year, Patrick Mahomes is different. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=656.88s)]
*  He's pretty even keeled, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=658.88s)]
*  which I think you have to be as a quarterback. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=660.92s)]
*  The interesting thing to me, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=662.6s)]
*  which we talked about Sunday night, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=663.6s)]
*  was I really do think Kelsey was going to retire if they won. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=664.76s)]
*  And that Kelsey, will he or will he not retire, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=668.76s)]
*  I think will be fun. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=672.32s)]
*  But just in general, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=673.4s)]
*  it's really hard to keep these windows open. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=675.08s)]
*  With NFL teams, we went through it with the Patriots [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=678.88s)]
*  a few different times. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=681.4399999999999s)]
*  It all depends on the drafts. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=682.64s)]
*  People wrote some good pieces about, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=684.16s)]
*  they missed on their left tackle pick this year. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=686.5999999999999s)]
*  Rashid Rice, which would have been [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=689.52s)]
*  this awesome wide receiver pick for him. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=691.3599999999999s)]
*  So you can just tilt it a little bit, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=693.8s)]
*  or all of a sudden, you're catchable. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=695.88s)]
*  And I think that was the thing that changed the most [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=698.4799999999999s)]
*  coming out of this season, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=700.92s)]
*  was like the Chiefs not only feel super catchable now, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=702.0s)]
*  we don't have to do the thing where we just hand them [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=705.88s)]
*  the game when we're talking about it. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=708.0s)]
*  Now it's like football has opened up for analysis. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=709.52s)]
*  So I'm excited for that. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=711.8399999999999s)]
*  From a Super Bowl standpoint, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=713.52s)]
*  the Brady Fox thing at the end, $375 million, whatever it is. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=716.1999999999999s)]
*  They certainly got a lot of ink and publicity [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=721.4399999999999s)]
*  and podcast content. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=723.64s)]
*  He was able to go on some of the Fox shows. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=725.64s)]
*  He had a couple of decent moments, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=728.56s)]
*  like in traditional podcast interview stuff. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=730.16s)]
*  I don't think from a game thing, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=733.1999999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't even put him in the top eight game guys I heard. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=734.52s)]
*  He's got this weird Vegas minority stake, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=738.8399999999999s)]
*  and he's allegedly hiring the coach, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=742.0799999999999s)]
*  and he's involved in their draft. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=744.0799999999999s)]
*  Is there a chance just this is it, this is a one and done? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=745.76s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=749.6s)]
*  I don't think he sees it like that. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=751.0s)]
*  I mean, that's from me poking around. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=752.4399999999999s)]
*  I think he's into this. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=754.4s)]
*  I mean, first of all, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=756.12s)]
*  the NFL doesn't care about the Vegas thing, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=757.56s)]
*  other than the meetings. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=760.08s)]
*  And by the way, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=761.48s)]
*  let's see where we are in year two with the meetings. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=762.3199999999999s)]
*  Cause I'm not convinced that wouldn't change in year two. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=764.56s)]
*  I think there's potential for that to be switched up [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=768.72s)]
*  by Goodell and everything after they've gone through [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=772.0s)]
*  that one year of this with him limited. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=773.6s)]
*  If you're him, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=776.4s)]
*  you're getting $37.5 million to work for six months, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=777.2399999999999s)]
*  work hard for six months, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=782.04s)]
*  but work for six months. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=783.16s)]
*  The NFL has said, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=784.4399999999999s)]
*  we don't care if you're a minority owner of the Raiders. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=785.68s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=787.9599999999999s)]
*  I got to ask him in Super Bowl week [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=789.4399999999999s)]
*  what his role with the Raiders was, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=791.28s)]
*  and he didn't tell me, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=792.64s)]
*  and he didn't provide any detail about that. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=794.28s)]
*  So I was like, okay. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=796.64s)]
*  So he's not gonna tell us at least for now [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=797.88s)]
*  about what he's doing with the Raiders. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=799.88s)]
*  Doesn't have to come clean about it. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=801.28s)]
*  I mean, seems like a pretty good deal to me. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=803.24s)]
*  I have been told pretty explicitly, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=806.12s)]
*  it's too much money. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=809.12s)]
*  There's no way he walks away. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=809.96s)]
*  It's too much money. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=811.76s)]
*  And this is one thing I think people forget [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=813.2s)]
*  with the super duper famous celebrities. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=816.52s)]
*  It's expensive to be a super duper famous celebrity. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=819.72s)]
*  Cause he, everywhere you go, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=823.08s)]
*  you're paying for like some private jet. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=824.8s)]
*  In his case, he got divorced. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=827.28s)]
*  Like it's as much money as he's made. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=828.76s)]
*  He still needs way more money [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=831.6s)]
*  to sustain the lifestyle he does. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=833.0400000000001s)]
*  And this is a $37.5 million check every year. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=834.52s)]
*  He's not giving it up if he doesn't have to. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=837.44s)]
*  It's not that hard of a job. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=839.28s)]
*  It's 22 weeks. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=840.88s)]
*  You study one game. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=842.6800000000001s)]
*  You fly to the site. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=844.16s)]
*  Like it's, you know, you have to keep in touch [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=845.24s)]
*  with the league a little bit, but not really. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=847.64s)]
*  The stunning thing to me is Belichick. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=849.5600000000001s)]
*  You know, this is not a midlife crisis [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=852.88s)]
*  cause he's in his mid seventies, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=854.88s)]
*  but even he was at Super Bowl, you know, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=856.2s)]
*  he was at a couple of parties. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=858.8000000000001s)]
*  He was walking around with his girlfriend. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=860.28s)]
*  We saw him at the fanatics party on Saturday. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=861.8399999999999s)]
*  It's just surreal. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=864.0799999999999s)]
*  This guy who was wearing this, you know, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=865.36s)]
*  saggy hoodie on the sidelines, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=869.04s)]
*  who just could care less than anyone thought. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=870.92s)]
*  Now he's in the Dunkin Donuts commercial [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=873.12s)]
*  with the girlfriend and this girlfriend's five years older [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=875.88s)]
*  than my daughter. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=879.0799999999999s)]
*  There was a lot of like, what the fuck is going on [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=880.24s)]
*  with this guy's stuff in New Orleans over the weekend? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=882.3199999999999s)]
*  And he was wearing all the rings. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=885.36s)]
*  And wearing all the rings, which he never, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=887.1999999999999s)]
*  that kind of thing he just never used to do. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=889.0s)]
*  Just as if to remind the NFL, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=891.36s)]
*  I won all these rings and you didn't hire me again. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=893.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=896.2s)]
*  I'm really starting to wonder, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=897.12s)]
*  this is a working theory, I'm not done with it yet, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=899.24s)]
*  but like 75 and up are just all bets off. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=901.08s)]
*  Like literally are all bets off. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=907.2800000000001s)]
*  We're talking about owners. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=908.96s)]
*  Cause in sports as fans, we have to deal with so many, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=911.08s)]
*  so many old people and we all have old people in our family. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=915.12s)]
*  You could see what happens as they hit their seventies [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=918.64s)]
*  then their eighties. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=920.92s)]
*  And the judgment just gets a little, little nuts. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=921.76s)]
*  And I just wonder with Belichick, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=926.6s)]
*  like I just, I can't believe some of this. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=927.96s)]
*  I really find it hard to believe he's coaching [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=930.0s)]
*  North Carolina too. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=931.72s)]
*  I get it. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=932.56s)]
*  I understand why he did it. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=933.52s)]
*  He didn't want to deal with owners anymore. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=934.6s)]
*  He just wants to be a coach, all that stuff. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=936.6s)]
*  But yet at the same time, he's, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=938.36s)]
*  seems like the celebrity aspect of this [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=940.68s)]
*  has become really appealing to him, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=942.8s)]
*  which I never in a million years would have guessed. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=944.08s)]
*  It's interesting to watch that. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=946.92s)]
*  Cause Nick Saban's kind of done the same thing [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=947.96s)]
*  in the college level. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=949.96s)]
*  And there's another guy who you're like, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=951.16s)]
*  why would he care about this? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=952.56s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=954.36s)]
*  You go on those podcasts, you go on the TV shows, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=955.2s)]
*  go on the Manning cast, everybody butters you up. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=957.88s)]
*  How many times did Bill Belichick get buttered up [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=961.4s)]
*  by media people when he was at the Pats last year? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=963.28s)]
*  He didn't want to, never dealt with them. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=965.12s)]
*  And then he had this really strange relationship [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=966.76s)]
*  with his owner and just kind of kept his little, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=969.16s)]
*  it's just basically in a cave, just going through film. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=971.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's like the ESPN car wash, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=975.44s)]
*  except it's not interviewing you. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=977.2800000000001s)]
*  It's just telling you how great you are all the time. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=979.4000000000001s)]
*  Really strange. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=981.4000000000001s)]
*  It was the whole thing. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=982.48s)]
*  I thought that was the weirdest sub part of the weekend. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=983.6400000000001s)]
*  Then the funny other funny thing [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=987.2800000000001s)]
*  that I immediately thought of you. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=988.7600000000001s)]
*  We always call it the Friday news dump. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=991.4000000000001s)]
*  What the Sixers did with the Joel Embiid information [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=994.0400000000001s)]
*  that they held and held and held and pushed out. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=997.72s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1001.12s)]
*  Right after the Eagles won the Superbowl. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1001.96s)]
*  I don't even, what do we call it? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1005.1600000000001s)]
*  This is a new level of news dump. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1006.2800000000001s)]
*  The Superbowl title. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1007.9200000000001s)]
*  We didn't want to bum out our city. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1009.9200000000001s)]
*  This was our only chance to put this out, news dump. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1011.44s)]
*  What is this? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1013.84s)]
*  We clogged the toilet so much. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1014.6800000000001s)]
*  The toilet wasn't fixable. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1016.4000000000001s)]
*  We just had to throw it away. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1017.5600000000001s)]
*  We had to put it on the curb. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1018.88s)]
*  Why is there yellow tape and a door locked [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1020.24s)]
*  in the guest bathroom? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1022.5200000000001s)]
*  Don't go in there. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1024.76s)]
*  Unprecedented, the best news dump I think ever. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1028.4s)]
*  I never ever remember a team pulling that off [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1031.04s)]
*  better. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1035.04s)]
*  This crazy Embiid article where it's like, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1035.8799999999999s)]
*  yeah, I'm probably never gonna be healthy again. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1037.1999999999998s)]
*  I may need surgery. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1039.24s)]
*  I shouldn't have played the Olympics. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1041.9199999999998s)]
*  It turns out all that. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1043.48s)]
*  It's like, oh my God, if they put that on on a Tuesday, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1044.8s)]
*  it would have been like a 36 hour story. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1047.24s)]
*  Instead it just kind of came and went in 10 seconds. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1049.24s)]
*  Totally, even during Superbowl week, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1051.96s)]
*  that would have been huge for a day. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1053.56s)]
*  It would have distracted us all. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1055.8799999999999s)]
*  What's your favorite news dump ever? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1058.52s)]
*  I think that might have been mine. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1061.04s)]
*  It's a really good one. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1062.56s)]
*  You're gonna have to give me a minute on that one, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1064.3200000000002s)]
*  but that's a good one. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1065.8000000000002s)]
*  All right, answer that on Press Box on Thursday. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1066.64s)]
*  Do your top five news dumps on the Press Box pod. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1068.88s)]
*  I remember last year when he had all the amazing [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1071.96s)]
*  political stories and American stories. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1074.4s)]
*  There was this thing on Twitter, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1076.76s)]
*  it's like, if you have anything, now's the time. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1077.6000000000001s)]
*  Send the press release. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1080.3200000000002s)]
*  Just bring it out. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1081.5600000000002s)]
*  No one will notice. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1082.8000000000002s)]
*  I remember when I was working on my HBO show [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1084.1200000000001s)]
*  and we were doing the test shows, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1086.5600000000002s)]
*  and it was three weeks before the show launched, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1088.68s)]
*  and the guy who hired me to do the show, Michael Lombardo, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1092.2s)]
*  and he was a huge advocate. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1096.52s)]
*  And three weeks before, it was Friday afternoon, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1098.0400000000002s)]
*  3.15 in the afternoon, and all of a sudden, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1102.0s)]
*  the stuff was out, that he was out at HBO. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1105.1200000000001s)]
*  It was the only time I'd ever really experienced [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1107.28s)]
*  a Friday news dump. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1110.52s)]
*  It was so perfectly calculated [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1111.4s)]
*  to just kind of sneak into the weekend with it. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1114.28s)]
*  I was like, oh, this is how you do it. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1116.68s)]
*  This is it. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1118.96s)]
*  Because any other day or moment, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1119.8000000000002s)]
*  this would have been the biggest Hollywood story. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1121.56s)]
*  And they were like, ugh. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1123.24s)]
*  This is happening right here. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1124.72s)]
*  It still happens. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1125.84s)]
*  ["The Biggest Hollywood Story"] [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhin96KhCPI&t=1126.68s)]
