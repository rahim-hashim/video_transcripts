# Who's Having the Worst NFL Season So Far? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [November 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K--U5vP4kY)
*  I have my season from hell rankings for you.
*  I'm going to give you my top four.
*  Tampa ranked third.
*  Tampa had the Brady Soap Opera all year.
*  They had the coaching, bizarre coaching thing where Bruce Arians decides at the end of March,
*  he's just going to move up into the front office.
*  They've had injuries galore.
*  Their body language is bizarre.
*  They were talking on the broadcast today where somebody was like, you know, when we got that
*  game winning touchdown against the Rams, it was Cameron Bray was telling the announcers,
*  you know, when we got that touchdown against the Rams, you just felt like that was a pivotal
*  moment for our season.
*  We're going to remember it's like, A, the Rams suck.
*  B, you're about to lose to the Browns.
*  No, T, seven third.
*  I have Arizona fourth.
*  They're four and eight to have this Kyle LaMurray contract that I'm guessing they would
*  probably do over.
*  They're on hard knocks.
*  My son and I watched the last hard knocks.
*  Are you watching them on hard knocks?
*  I haven't.
*  I'm on missed.
*  Have I missed three already now?
*  Yeah, it's pretty good.
*  I'll tell you this.
*  I don't have a lot of faith in Cliff Kingsbury after the hard knocks episodes I've watched.
*  I don't I don't really see a future for him as an NFL coach.
*  It's really rough.
*  He seems like a good hang, but it's this last episode pretty rough.
*  Anyway, I have them fourth.
*  Number two, the three and eight Rams, who I think now are the second worst team in the
*  league, right?
*  Houston's worst.
*  They're second worst.
*  Would you have Denver?
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, I had your Panthers last week, so I'm not sure.
*  It's the second worst Denver because they can't score 20 points.
*  You see that stat.
*  They have the lowest points per game in like 20 years.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  So that's your number one or the pack?
*  Yeah.
*  So no, Denver is my number one.
*  The Rams, no first round pick.
*  It's going to Detroit.
*  Stafford looks like he's broken down now.
*  Right.
*  Denver, no pick either.
*  You got to replace the Packers trade with Tampa Bay, trade the bays there because Tampa
*  is in first place and this is still exactly what Brady wanted.
*  Like he knew it.
*  Yeah, you're right.
*  Green Bay did have a yeah.
*  So I'll put Tampa fifth.
*  You're right.
*  Green Bay should be third.
*  The Rams, the other thing with the Rams, they're getting crushed in these games now.
*  I'm going to be really interested to see what happens with the Rams, quote unquote fans
*  in the season ticket stuff next year and stuff like that, because this is like right
*  around the renewal time, right?
*  It's like, oh, do you want to renew your Rams tickets?
*  And you're thinking, well, wait a second.
*  There's three and eight.
*  Matthew Stafford is basically a zombie at this point.
*  They have no first round pick.
*  Their cap is in hell.
*  Every time I go to a game, it's 70 percent fans of the other teams.
*  You know what?
*  I think I'm not going to renew my tickets.
*  I tried to sell six of the tickets already this year.
*  Right.
*  Even when they were good, I tried to sell them and couldn't get anything for them.
*  My dog, my dog Walker went to three games.
*  Yeah.
*  My gardener went to Fox Network doesn't even believe in them.
*  They did a big Thanksgiving campaign for the Rams chiefs and didn't mention the Rams once.
*  Greg Olsen and Aaron Andrews in a huddle talking about this game.
*  And it was just about Pat.
*  Patrick Holmes was.
*  Yeah, that was it.
*  Yeah, that should be a good indication.
*  So I have them too.
*  I think the clear number one is Denver.
*  Denver is three and nine.
*  They have no pick.
*  Their best player, Givante Williams, tore his ACL.
*  Their coach sucks.
*  They have to they're going to have to fire him and get another coach.
*  Right.
*  He's he was one of the worst coaching hires we've had in a while.
*  And the Wilson trade is one of the worst trades.
*  Not only recent football history, it's one of the worst trades in the 21st century in sports.
*  That guy looks like he's forgotten.
*  It's like Darren Williams when he started to get bad near the end with the Nets, but worse.
*  And I asked my buddy Gus, Gus Ramsey, diehard Denver fan.
*  I'm like, what's he saying?
*  I've been like, is this the worst Broncos season ever?
*  Like it has to be right.
*  And he said it was either this one or the second McDaniel season when they fired McDaniels midway
*  through. The difference is they don't have a pick this year.
*  They don't have an out with Wilson until after 2026.
*  They can't even cut him.
*  They can't do anything.
*  Yeah, I think the team doesn't like them.
*  They don't want to fly with them.
*  They're yelling at him on the sidelines.
*  Everybody's you know, they get it with Russell Wilson already and he can't throw the football.
*  And this coach is a disaster, too.
*  You're right.
*  I mean, it's just it's all come together with them and the no pick.
*  Yeah, they're number one.
*  No question.
*  Gus was saying how bad they were.
*  And I went and looked at their pro football because he was like the AFL.
*  They were bad the whole time.
*  I went back and looked.
*  They never made the playoffs in the AFL and they didn't really when they made the Super Bowl
*  and lost to your guys in 77.
*  That was like kind of their first moment.
*  But then after that, they were relevant pretty much all the way through.
*  They would have like a couple of years, but then they have Elway basically for 16 years.
*  Going to the 2000s, they kept having these little mini runs.
*  They ended up winning another Super Bowl in 2013.
*  But for the most part, they were always they were always relevant or they always had something going.
*  This is the first time you can look at them and go, you guys have nothing going.
*  You're in a quarterback.
*  You're in a division with Herbert and Mahomes.
*  You're just fucked for the next five, six years.
*  You have no first round pick.
*  You have new owners that they have to be like, holy shit, did we buy a lemon?
*  I mean, I know they just want to get in the league, but you can't think of a this would be the number one worst team.
*  You probably want to buy from a talent standpoint.
*  But so anyway, they have to be number one.
*  So we're not sure what we agree.
*  And I don't know.
*  I could see Elway bowing out soon.
*  I mean, how many quarterbacks is it going to go through?
*  Right.
*  If this didn't work.
*  And like you said, it's going to be another six or seven years probably before they can get back on the map somehow.
*  It's crazy.
*  They've been relevant pretty much our entire life since we've been following football in the mid 70s.
*  And they're not going to be relevant for a long, long time.
