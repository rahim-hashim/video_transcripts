# Are the Ravens Super Bowl Favorites? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [December 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s)
*  So the Ravens had the best record in the league. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=0.0s)]
*  It, they're in the driver's seat now for the one seat in the AFC. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=3.08s)]
*  They just got to beat Miami next week, which, you know, won't be, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=7.24s)]
*  won't be a walk in the park, but waddles got a high ankle sprain. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=11.0s)]
*  There's been some offensive line injuries. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=13.88s)]
*  They're defensive line. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=16.52s)]
*  You know, I don't think Miami is quite the same team. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=17.56s)]
*  Maybe they were six weeks ago. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=20.62s)]
*  They're definitely more beatable. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=22.44s)]
*  So the Ravens can get the one seat. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  They get a buy. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=25.84s)]
*  You'd have to go through Baltimore the first two rounds. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=26.84s)]
*  Then they're in, would be in Vegas for the Superbowl, which I think a dome [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=29.08s)]
*  would be good for that team because they're fast. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  So to me, it's like, I think they're legit favorites now. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=35.16s)]
*  I didn't even see what the odds were. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=40.8s)]
*  I I've been, you know, I was screaming about the Niners at plus two 20 all week. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=42.08s)]
*  Now they're only plus two 30 and the Ravens are plus four 60. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  So that's right now. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=49.64s)]
*  Is that a, yeah, I feel like that's on Fandle. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=51.84s)]
*  I feel like they haven't, they didn't, they just respected this win here. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=53.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=58.440000000000005s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  You think they leave it open like that? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=60.92s)]
*  I think they should flip that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=61.68000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=63.6s)]
*  They should be updating that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  How are the, how do they, that doesn't make sense. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  That's bizarre. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=69.48s)]
*  I think it was Raheem who said on the ringer gambling show, the best bet all [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=70.04s)]
*  week, if you thought the Ravens had a chance to win this game was the Lamar MVP odds. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  I said that because it was, oh, you said it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=78.04s)]
*  Plus we've talked about that on against the odds. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=80.2s)]
*  It was five to one. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=82.44s)]
*  And notice that we were saying like, if you like the Ravens to win Sunday or [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=83.4s)]
*  Monday night, just take the MVP odds instead. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=86.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=89.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=89.6s)]
*  So they were like plus, plus what? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=90.56s)]
*  Plus 200 to win the game today. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=92.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=95.28s)]
*  The MVP odds were five to one. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=95.56s)]
*  And now I would say it's, I'm going to say it's pretty much a wrap. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=97.84s)]
*  I don't think Sam Darnold did enough today either to get in there. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=101.84s)]
*  To win MVP? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=105.56s)]
*  No. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=106.64s)]
*  No, he came in as we're doing this pretty, was pretty 19 to one when you looked at this earlier. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=108.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was just 19 and one. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=113.08s)]
*  He dropped to six. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=114.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=116.48s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=117.8s)]
*  We would never seen a shift like that from one game and yet it makes sense. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=119.12s)]
*  Maybe we're not, maybe we weren't monitoring this week to week like we used to. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=124.08s)]
*  Maybe, I mean, maybe we're monitoring it more closely, but I don't remember it's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=129.16s)]
*  swinging week to week like this. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=132.08s)]
*  It feels like since week four, it's been so I remember that one year when Russell [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=133.48s)]
*  Wilson after four or five weeks and we were doing the, Oh, Russell Wilson, he's [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=137.56s)]
*  never won, maybe this is the year. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=141.72s)]
*  But this is where it's been like each week there's a new guy. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=143.23999999999998s)]
*  Dak week seemed like it was five months ago. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=147.39999999999998s)]
*  It was like two weeks ago. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=149.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  I think when there's no Mahomes in the mix and no Rogers and no Brady, it [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=151.39999999999998s)]
*  really is anyone's game. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=155.32s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=156.67999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=157.48s)]
*  Well, on the Raven side, it felt, this felt super boldly this game. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=158.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=165.76s)]
*  Definitely felt like a playoff game. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=166.39999999999998s)]
*  If it's not San Francisco, who is it? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=167.6s)]
*  Because it's, it's probably your stupid team. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=172.16s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  Could this be Baltimore Dallas? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=176.04s)]
*  Based on this weekend? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=179.32s)]
*  No. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=181.72s)]
*  Was that bad? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=182.4s)]
*  Was that like a horrible loss for you or did it was that there was some [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=183.28s)]
*  moral victory pieces in there? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=186.68s)]
*  Like that drive Dak had was about as good as anything I've seen from Dak in his career. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=188.16s)]
*  That was a clutch drive that if his defense holds up, we're talking about, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=193.88s)]
*  oh my God, Dallas, they finally arrived. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=199.44s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=201.56s)]
*  And instead you gave up the game winning drives. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=202.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=204.56s)]
*  I mean, I, I feel like I don't trust the coaches more than anything. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=204.88s)]
*  And I praised McCarthy last week and I hated him for handing off to the full [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=208.44s)]
*  back on first and goal, not even really the full backs fault. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=212.56s)]
*  It never got to him. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=215.76s)]
*  And I didn't like the defense or the fewest pressures in three years. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=216.96s)]
*  Um, and then Dan Quinn, like, you know, we were joking about, Hey, do you [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=220.88s)]
*  let the dolphins score from the 40? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=224.32s)]
*  But there was, there were no man's lamb with like four and a half minutes left. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=226.36s)]
*  Like, don't let this be their last drives. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=229.52s)]
*  Like don't let them line up for a field goal. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=231.88s)]
*  And that's what they did. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=233.4s)]
*  It's exactly what they did. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=234.28s)]
*  They gave them five yard passes all the way down to the 15 or 20. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=235.08s)]
*  And, uh, yeah, that sucked. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=238.68s)]
*  So I thought that they didn't play great, but they were still in a good position to win. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  Uh, but again, I don't know if that game mattered as much. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=245.24s)]
*  You just don't want to keep losing games like this is the problem. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=248.08s)]
*  That game and this Ravens Niners game felt like the level of play was a little [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=251.72s)]
*  bit higher than everything else we watched over the course of the week. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=256.36s)]
*  Like to me, those all felt like teams I could see in a Superbowl and they all, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=259.76s)]
*  they'll have a little, little bit of flaws. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=264.04s)]
*  Like I think the Ravens, they're, they're running game at some point [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=265.72s)]
*  against the wrong team. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=270.28000000000003s)]
*  The fact that they don't have an awesome running back is going [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=271.40000000000003s)]
*  to hurt them a little bit. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=274.36s)]
*  But, you know, Lamar three, four times a game just creates something out of nothing [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=275.24s)]
*  where, you know, that's, that's something the Patriots, like with the quarterbacks [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=281.2s)]
*  we've had the last couple of years when you don't have that quarterback who could [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=284.6s)]
*  just create a wow play out of nowhere. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=287.08s)]
*  He does it once a quarter. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=289.2s)]
*  Uh, but I thought those four, especially with what happened with KC today, what [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=291.04s)]
*  Buffalo looked like, he goes through and it's like, those are probably the four best [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=294.92s)]
*  teams. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=299.12s)]
*  And Philly looked like a loss today. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=299.96000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=301.76s)]
*  I mean, basically went back and forth between maybe covering a giant number [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=302.2s)]
*  and losing the game outright between a team. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, the long touchdown late was just outrageous. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=310.4s)]
*  Like that can never happen. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=313.64s)]
*  The giant touchdown? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=315.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=316.72s)]
*  You're trying to prove to us you're a serious Superbowl contender and you're [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=317.68s)]
*  right at the ship and then you give up this long touchdown. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=321.48s)]
*  And even at the end of the game, you're barely holding on to this eight point win [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=324.48s)]
*  where the giants have the ball and they have a chance to at least tie it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=328.6s)]
*  I, I, that game did not make me feel better about the Eagles. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=331.8s)]
*  What kind of odds could I give you that a participant in last year's Superbowl [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=334.84000000000003s)]
*  doesn't want to play off game this year? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=338.84000000000003s)]
*  The chiefs or Eagles don't win. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=341.32s)]
*  They'll both have a home game. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=344.08000000000004s)]
*  Do they survive that home game? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=346.32s)]
*  Cause if I'm on the other side, I see those chiefs. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=347.68s)]

*  And, uh, Eagles, I don't know, throw the Rams at them or a team like that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwWf0Xeg6s&t=359.36s)]
