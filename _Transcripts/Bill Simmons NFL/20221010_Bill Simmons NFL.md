# Are Next-Gen Stats Messing With NFL Coaches? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [October 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpp0CIepHwA)
*  All right. So this starts on Thursday night with Nat Hackett, who's up three.
*  Listen, people have talked about it, but we're just going to rehash it quick.
*  They're up three. It's fourth to one.
*  Matt Ryan has been sacked or hit 230 times in a four quarter game.
*  The Colts have six points. They have no receivers.
*  They have no chance. Zero, none of going 80 yards.
*  And Nat Hackett sees all of this and he says, you know what?
*  We're going to go for it on fourth of one.
*  Not only are we going to go for it, we're going to throw it with my quarterback,
*  who's been completely erratic and had terrible judgment and looks washed up this whole game.
*  That's what we're going to do. They do it. They don't get it.
*  Colts come back down. We end up in overtime.
*  I had the Broncos. I mean, this whole analytics thing, it's been beaten to death ad nauseam.
*  And it's turned into a, you have to be on one side or the other.
*  I like analytics. I also like the concept of just watching a football game and feeling the rhythms of
*  it. And sometimes maybe throwing out the next gen stats and just looking at stuff like,
*  all right, I've stood on the sideline here for three hours.
*  Do I think the Colts can go 80 yards? I do not.
*  I'm going to take the, I'm going to take the three points and go up six because
*  I don't think they can score. We were talking tonight, Bengals Ravens, where the, the Bengals,
*  I mean, talk about year of the dumbass, Zach Taylor, first down and goal from the two.
*  They do. They do a reverse. Somehow they do a reverse that ends up third and third down.
*  They tried to really special, right? Yeah. Yeah. It was a version of the Philly special
*  and then the shovel pass. But no, I know what you're saying. I didn't, I didn't want to jump
*  games either, but yeah, Joe Mixon has 13 touchdowns. You get analytics dictates that that guy can't get
*  the ball now. Just run the ball plays. How about your six foot five quarterback who could do a QB
*  sneak, which by the way, they did the next time around and ended up doing it the fourth and two.
*  And I would have taken the field. I would have taken the points. It was a field goal game.
*  Nope. We got to go for it. Next gen stats say that we have a 2% chance more to get it ends up with
*  a shovel pass in the 17 guys. Then the Ravens come back down and it's fourth and short and Harbaugh
*  takes the points and everyone goes, I went on Twitter, everyone went nuts. Oh my God. Baltimore's
*  betrayed who they are. It's like, I don't know. Did they, they're up six. I thought that was smart.
*  Yeah. Even if the Bengals go down and score a touchdown, you still get the ball back with a
*  chance to kick a field goal to go up to. Nobody factors in that part. If you don't get that fourth
*  and one, now the Bengals can get a touchdown and go up four. It's just, nobody talks about the
*  football situations or the fact that you have Justin Tucker. We're house. They're talking about
*  it. You've Justin Tucker, even if I'm down to, I just have to get to the 50 yard line. I win the game.
*  Worst case scenario, you have three timeouts, two minutes left and the best kicker has ever
*  done it. Right. That, that, that was it. And so yeah, you go up six and plus you've been
*  stifled on fourth and one before I'm with the Nate Hackett is a breed of his own though. I think.
*  And then you're saying, no, there's no way the Colts would come down. Nobody scored that game.
*  Analytics, you're right. Doesn't, doesn't see that there were no touchdowns in that game and
*  there weren't going to be, you know, so. Right. My issue with the analytics is that the situation
*  has, we, you and I are talking about this. It doesn't seem to factor in stuff like, well,
*  this team has Justin Tucker. So if they go up six, even if the Bengals come down and score a
*  touchdown, they're still going to win by two. We knew it was going to happen when the Bengals scored
*  17, 16. It's like, guess what? The Ravens are going to get to the 40 and Justin Tucker is going to
*  kick a field goal. It's just these analytics that happen in a vacuum without.
*  And that's the point is, you know, we all have observed analytics at work in a lot of different
*  situations in sports over like the last 15 years or so in many ways that I think it's pretty
*  enjoyable. It's added to my enjoyment of the NBA, the revolution with the three points and so forth.
*  And in football, there is this weird binary, either the analytics, you know, sort of dictate
*  the direction you're going to go in or you're going against the analytics. And I think that's
*  the wrong framework. I think it needs to be, it's the analytics provide information. It's a data
*  point. It's information about, you know, you're, you want to mitigate kind of the risk position
*  that you're in. You want to slightly increase the likelihood that you can win. Okay. The math is
*  kind of supportive of it. And also I'm coaching this football game and I know how the game's been
*  going and I know who my kicker is and I know how my defense is playing and I know who's gassed.
*  I know who in the secondary I need to sub out. Like all of those things are data points that
*  are important elements of making a complete comprehensive decision. And it's why the guys
*  up in the booth, you know, they have analytics guys, but those guys are also football coaches,
*  I believe. Right. They're not just mathematicians. So that's the point, right?
*  If there's a hint of the idea that your quarterback has a torn labrum,
*  I think at that point you could stiff arm the 26 year old computer nerd and say, hey, step back
*  here. We're going to kick it. You know, like this is a, I hate to bring blackjack back into it,
*  but I was thinking like, okay, I think analytics nerds treat it like we do. Like when you have a
*  two, when you have a 12 against the two, you're like, I always hit or I always stay. I'm not going
*  to change, but there are other factors, right? If the last 10 cards were picture cards, you're going
*  to do something different than you might if there were threes and fours coming out. Right.
*  Yeah. Well, so Harbaugh, who people were saying, or people thought maybe because of what happened
*  to them last week, they have now betrayed their identity by not going in on fourth down.
*  I look at it the other way. I didn't think, you know, the running, I know they were running for
*  like four and a half yards, but they don't have like that big physical runner for the fourth and
*  short. I thought Lamar was really sloppy in the game today. Right. Like he missed throws left and
*  right. And I don't want to give the Bengals life. I just want to go up six. The Bengals had scored
*  10 points to that point that had a bunch of three and outs. I was getting pressure on Borough and
*  I'm going to make the bet that they can't go 80 yards and get seven. And even if they get the seven,
*  I'm going to bet on my guy to come back down and my, and the best field goal kicker of all time.
*  Yeah. I don't know. I just feel like this isn't like cut and dry. It's not like it says 82% they
*  should have gone versus 75% that they shouldn't. So they should have gone. Like you have to weigh
*  the situation.
