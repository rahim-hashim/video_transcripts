# AFC OverUnders with Cousin Sal  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [August 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKFIQ8IRGAs)
*  All right, we're taping this on a Tuesday afternoon in Los Angeles, California, home of two NFL teams,
*  home of Guest Alliance since 2007.
*  Wow.
*  Home of me and cousin Sal. We're back, baby.
*  I love it. I love it. I love it. I gave nephew Kyle the biggest hug you can even imagine.
*  I think that counts as third base.
*  Yeah, he doesn't have a ton of intimacy in his family. I don't know. Did you handle that all right?
*  He's got it now.
*  I don't know. You're not a big hugging family, Kyle.
*  I did what I had to do. We got through that hug.
*  This is great for me.
*  I was accused of being a half hugger when I was in situ with my buddy, Sully's wife.
*  Really?
*  I gave her a full hug and she's like, that was a good hug because you've always been a half hugger.
*  And I was like, that's kind of the deep down most insulting thing anyone said to me.
*  It's also very weird because it's like, what am I supposed to do? Throw you in the bathroom?
*  Like, what's going on?
*  You want like a full body?
*  Yeah.
*  So I don't know. I'm just going to lean in.
*  Yeah. I know.
*  I'm not going to like full body hugger.
*  But the point is, we are here. It's exciting. Football. It's great for you too. You don't have
*  to talk about these nonsensical NBA trades. They're never going to happen. Second freaking
*  apron, CBA.
*  You don't have to do the NBA whole thing anymore. I told you. I'm now more in on the NFL.
*  I love it.
*  I love it.
*  Well, it's a super fun season because we have these rookie QBs.
*  We have embattled QBs. We have a QB in Dallas who doesn't have a contract yet.
*  We have some really bad QBs. It's all over the map. We're going to start with the AFC.
*  All right.
*  Sal and I do every year is we do the over unders.
*  Yeah.
*  I feel like we didn't invent over unders, but I feel like we were the first content
*  brand to really be like, we're going all in on picking over unders.
*  And this is going to be an actual game.
*  I'm going to say we invented over unders.
*  We invented it in fun. I'll take credit.
*  Let me just say this one thing. Okay. Last year you were better than me, 17 and 15.
*  I was 16 and 16. This guy, Chris Haynes is a big fan of ours. Happy birthday.
*  We are 25 and 12 over the last two years on teams we agree on, whether they're over under.
*  Did we do locks last year? Because I have some locks.
*  I think we did too. Yeah. 25 and 12.
*  I was only 17 and 15 last year. It's disappointing.
*  Yeah.
*  That's some bad ones. I might be over prepared, which is usually a bad sign for me,
*  but we're going to go in over and start with the AFC East, a division that I have stared at
*  over and over again. We have jets and dolphin fans in our life. The dolphin fans are very
*  testing, including John Distrasti.
*  I love it. I love the back and forth on our text.
*  One thing has changed in this division since we started this two month process.
*  The jets have become the favorite. The New York football jets, they're now the favorite.
*  They are plus 160 to win the division. They're over under as nine and a half
*  wins in a 17 game season. A lot of juice on that. Minus 162. Minus 170 to make the playoffs.
*  Plus 850 to be the one seed if you want to get frisky. I hate that I like it.
*  That's where I've landed. I hate that I like it. They have a ton of talent.
*  I kept coming back to this number, Sal. Seven and 10 last year.
*  Their quarterback last year couldn't win the backup quarterback job on a team with Jared
*  Stenum and Bo Nicks. He's the third string quarterback, Zach Wilson on that team. That's
*  who their quarterback was last year. I don't know if other people played. I can't even
*  name some of the people they had. It's just hard for me to believe with a much better offensive
*  line that they spent money on with Breece Hall two years out of the ACL with Rodgers coming back.
*  It's hard for me not to believe that they don't get to 10, 11 wins.
*  This is the tricky one. There's a bunch that are at nine and a half and you're like,
*  oh, that's easy to go 10 or that's easy to go nine. I think this is asking too much to go over
*  nine and a half at minus 162. I know this has now become personal with me and Aaron Rodgers. This is
*  not me, my cousin. We're not giving big hugs like I did to nephew Kyle. You wouldn't do
*  ayahuasca with him? Wouldn't do ayahuasca with him. Ayahuasca? Let's think about it though. When
*  was he last good? Let's play the art show. I have all this data. He hasn't been good in three years
*  and then there's some other old QB stuff. Dan Marino, age 38. 12 TDs, 17 picks this final year.
*  Favre, age 41, 11 TDs, 19 picks. Manning, 2015 when they won the Super Bowl. He was 39 years old. Nine
*  TDs, 17 picks. But it does get a little better the last decade. Breeze, who I always felt we were
*  betting against every week and who felt like he couldn't complete a 10 yard out. His stats were
*  pretty good the last couple years. He played, he only missed five games when he was 40. He only
*  missed four when he was 41. Made the playoffs one of those years. He's a guest on Cousin Sal's winning
*  weekend this week so I'm not going to say anything bad about it. And Phil Rivers, age 39, 24 TDs,
*  11 picks in that last year. So the recent precedent says it's not crazy that Rodgers will be okay. But
*  in 2022, I think he threw like seven touchdowns and seven interceptions in his last five games and
*  then lost that game to Detroit. I think we're spoiled by Tom Brady and Mick Jagger. That these
*  guys go on forever and they do what they do and so Rodgers has to do the same thing. Throw Diane Lane in too.
*  Yeah, throw Diane Lane in. Yeah, for sure. But I'm not seeing it with him. I don't know. And also,
*  if you had to bet over on their 13 and a half games he starts. This guy who might go on an
*  ayahuasca retreat in Antarctica or host Jeopardy in Egypt. I don't know what he's going to do.
*  His mind could be elsewhere. Plus the election coming out. Don't bet against them that week for sure.
*  I don't know. I'm just not buying it. Somehow they have like one of the easier schedules but
*  six prime time games. So I don't know. The league did him a favor. Yeah, so it's fairly easy the
*  first few weeks and then it gets a little choppy for them. But especially with the San Francisco
*  game in week one that we'll be doing on Guess the Lines on Sunday. That's a game in week 10. I
*  wouldn't like it for them but I like catching San Francisco in week one. I don't know if IU is going
*  to play. Trent Williams still holding out. They just could be one of those games. The Jets are
*  completely healthy at this point. They got the Patriots twice. They play Minnesota and they
*  play Denver week five and week four. So they could be like four and one five and oh after
*  first five in London. They got a hot seat coach and they're also the Jets. So the case against them,
*  the Rogers age thing. They're the Jets. All the baggage the Jets have which I think if you really
*  unpack it the Jets have had some good seasons. They've made AFC title games. They won playoff
*  games in New England against Belichick. The talent is what I keep coming back to with them.
*  I did the dumb talent rankings thing I do every year. They're a great fantasy team. I had six of
*  their 11 starters. I have marked down as like pink chipper, red chipper, blue chipper. Pink? Hall was
*  color of a chip, a good chip. Yeah, I like to use different colors.
*  Reese Hall is the number one pick in every fantasy draft right now because McAfee got hurt.
*  Wilson's the seventh best receiver, the eighth best receiver. Their offensive line I had as like
*  it's not one of the top five but it's definitely in the six to ten range. So it's a great spot for
*  Rogers and if you're really going to dig him you're just going to say Robert Sout. If they'd hired
*  Mac Vrabel they would have won the Super Bowl and I get that logic but if he's just worrying defense
*  that's it and it's like Rogers take the offense. I know nothing about offense. I'm just going to
*  coach this defense and be like fired up guy on the sidelines. They did go seven and ten with Zach
*  Wilson. All right but they beat the commanders, the Jets, the Giants last year. That game was
*  pathetic. Nobody wanted them. The Patriots had hung it up so there's some weird wins there. Look,
*  they're not going to be terrible. I think they're a nine and 18 and that's why I just have them on.
*  One of the things I like about the division bet is you can swing against it. There's a couple
*  teams like this this year. They could be four and one five and oh after five weeks potentially and
*  then there's going to be good value on some of the other teams and maybe just zag the other way but
*  to me I think there's one playoff team in this division. That's where I landed and it was them
*  versus Buffalo and Miami and we'll talk about Buffalo in a second but I just think that they
*  had less variables for me. When you have that much talent what has to go wrong? Basically you have to
*  have Rogers go out three plays into week one last year or you have to have Salah just be a complete
*  disaster and cost them a couple games. Other than that I couldn't really see the turf. The turf causes
*  so many injuries for Judges. I just couldn't see a ton of ways it could go wrong for them.
*  I guess I oversimplified it and said Rogers isn't as good as we remember him and the Jets are the
*  Jets. So nine wins seem more likely than 10. I don't think they've taken the torch from Buffalo.
*  I don't think there's more to dislike about Buffalo. Well let's talk about Buffalo.
*  Buffalo's over is 10.5 which has a lot of juice on it. Now the other way it's plus 134 so they
*  want you to think Buffalo's going to live it at six. They're plus 195 to win the division
*  which at the start of like August was plus 160 so nobody's betting that. They're plus 126 to
*  miss the playoffs. They're right in that zone that we're going to cover a little later of. There's
*  always one or two teams from like plus 125 to plus like 160 that just don't make it and you just want
*  to grab the right ones. They're plus 270 for the wild card that I thought was tasty and then if
*  you want to get super crazy under seven and a half wins is plus 260. Last year they were 11 and six
*  and all six losses were six points or less. Last five years they're 58 and 24 and Alan is either the
*  second third or fourth best quarterback in the world, the pinion, where you have him. I would
*  probably have him second or third. This is the year we find out how good he is because the team
*  they have like 60 million bucks in wasted cap space. They had a bunch of dudes leave,
*  bunch their safeties are gone, their centers gone, top two receivers are gone. They got 60 million
*  in dead cap space. It's all telling us this team's going to suck and yet I don't want to pick Josh
*  Allen to be in single digits. Yeah and I don't know why you would. Like I think every year we
*  start this podcast looking for a way to not pick Buffalo. I don't know why we don't want to like
*  it. It's a little like Tom Cruise. Like why do people not want to like this guy? Josh Allen's
*  doing his own stunts. I know right of course. He solved the feud with you and Jeff Ross. Exactly.
*  Movies back. He taught us about Scientology. Of course, of course. So he's Tom Cruise. We have
*  Tom Cruise playing quarterback for the best team in the division. He taught us about motion.
*  Did you see that PSA he did with Christopher McCrory? Oh right yeah. About motion on your TV,
*  how you should turn it off so the movie's experienced. Tom Cruise does some good work.
*  You wouldn't bet against that guy. I wouldn't. Like if there were box office numbers. You wouldn't
*  bet there on there. I bet it's a high contest or a slam dunk contest. Yeah all right that's fine but
*  still gonna do it with Buffalo. Look they've won three consecutive AFC East titles. Like we want to
*  pick against them and I feel like unlike the others they needed to win five games down the
*  stretch in a row to make the playoffs and we all knew they were gonna do it. We all knew they would
*  do it because they have this extra gear. They get better when it gets colder. You can't say that for
*  any other team and they're not the Jets. So I love it. I think replacing Diggs and Davis is
*  addition by subtraction. Yeah neither of us like Diggs. Yeah Diggs will get to Houston later on but
*  I thought this team had a little bit of an odor to them. Good or bad? Bad. Oh.
*  Milano when he went out until December. Right. Because that was like Milano's gonna be back.
*  He's healthy at least they have him. He's so good. He does something and then now he's out.
*  Right. That pushed me over the edge with it and I actually have them under 10 and a half because I
*  think 11 is too. They could still win 10. They could still go 10 and 7 so I'm not even necessarily
*  betting against that. But 11 and 6 with the amount of like new blood they have, new captains,
*  all these rookies they're leaning on, all these receivers. Who's their number one receiver?
*  Everyone's like Shakir watch out for him. It's like I've watched Shakir the last couple years.
*  We have no idea if that dude can handle that. He had better stats than Diggs last year. I get it.
*  It's gonna be Keon Coleman the FSU rookie and Curtis Samuel. Rookie receiver. Yeah. I just
*  feel like he does gets it done Josh Allen. It doesn't really matter who's out there. Like they
*  get it. They have no room for error for him if there's like a four week Josh Allen injury.
*  Their offensive line is 100% worse and it's interesting. I was I've been going on the team
*  reddits and 99% of the time it's useless but then occasionally there'd be a thread where somebody's
*  like hey guys what do you guys think? And people just lay out these compelling cases. Right. And
*  it's interesting with the Buffalo fans. I think they all feel like this is potentially a throwaway
*  year for them where it's like McDermott just gets fired if it doesn't work out. But on the other
*  hand they're all kind of like you can't count us out either because if this guy hits and this guy
*  hits and we have Josh and new assistants and maybe the vibes are better. They're like one play away from making the
*  super right. Like they want to they want to game against the Steelers that Chiefs game could have
*  been anyone's like I don't I don't think this is a rebuilding year at all. They end against New England
*  the Jets and then at New England again they have your team two out of the last three. So well can I
*  give you their last two years of playoff games. Yeah. They barely beat Skyler Thompson.
*  They got smoked by Cincinnati completely manhandled. They beat Pittsburgh in round one.
*  Yeah. Chiefs game was close. Yeah. Choked at home. Yeah. Choked at home against KC. Right. And I just
*  wonder and I feel this we're going to talk to San Francisco in part two but sometimes you miss your
*  window and that would be my fear with them. Maybe they just got passed by the Jets. I think the Jets
*  have just way more talent. If you line up their roster side by side Josh is the only reason to pick
*  Buffalo. So I think he starts six more games than Aaron Rodgers this year. This is a gutty
*  team. That's the thing. See that's why I hate this division because I'm now stuck with Big Shot Bob
*  Salla and Rodgers who hasn't been good in three years. Now I'm stuck with that as a pick but.
*  By the way I don't believe that you're going on the team Reddit page. This is something your
*  slack guys are saying. I do. I go on the team. Kyle there's no way. No I go on the teams. I have a whole thing. I have
*  an AFC Reddit with all the bookmarks. Really? Well just because I want to make sure I'm not missing
*  anything but not with every team. That might be more pathetic than what I do here filling out every
*  single win every single game for every team. My family won't even talk to me anymore because I
*  know all this nonsense. Look I'm going to show you my bookmarks. NFL 2024. There's my AFC Reddit and
*  my NFC Reddit. And my NFL Reddit. I have under for the bills. And you have over. So you're going 11
*  wins for them? Yeah 11 and 6. So this is not good. So so far we disagree on the on the two. Yeah but
*  we knew we would hate this division. We're going to agree on this next team. The Miami Dolphins.
*  Over is nine and a half. Juice on that minus 134. Their division is plus 210.
*  Plus 950 would be the number one seed. If you want to go 11 plus wins for them that's plus 160. If you
*  want to go the other way do under eight and a half that's plus 166. I wrote for every team. I wrote
*  better worse. Better was unclear for me with the Dolphins. I can't I couldn't really think of a way
*  they got better unless you're saying Vic Fangio is the defensive coordinator. It was so bad
*  that now they're better off and there's new blood. Worse like they lost Wilkins.
*  You know their entire middle of their defensive line he's gone. Tua lost a bunch of weight.
*  That makes me nervous. Last year was like Tua's got to get bigger. He's got to withstand. Now it's
*  like he's back. I'm glad I didn't lose that weight I talked about talking about. He gave the weight to
*  you. Phillips and Chubb both coming off major injuries. Phillips is playing Chubbs is out first
*  four weeks. Last year they were one and six against 2023 playoff teams and their two best receivers got
*  paid. I just don't like a lot when you throw in the schedule. I'm a pretty easy under for the Dolphins.
*  I think it's sometimes it's hard for us to separate the playoff version of its team and the regular
*  season and this is the Dolphins are the AFC Cowboys right. Like you know what you're going to get in
*  January. They were 11 and six. They have an owner who thinks he's also the GM. Yes he's the GM. They
*  have a coach. They're only paying three guys. I guess that part's true. Their head coach is auditioning
*  for John Travolta's drug dealer in Pulp Fiction 2 or something. I don't know what does he look like.
*  Mike Mcdandle the way he dresses it. I thought he looked like Brock Landers when we hit the 80s and
*  he's filming the documentary for Amber waves and he's just wearing the sunglasses and looks like
*  he's just blown a big bowl of something. That's probably better. Was that on Dolphins Reddit?
*  I didn't see that on Dolphins Reddit actually. I like that. No listen I here's why they're a good
*  team. They have this cheat code in Tyree Kill who's good for seven free points a game or a 40 yard
*  bomb a game. That's a free play. Maybe two or three of those a game. A kid a game. What? And a kid.
*  Yes and definitely a kid by halftime. A lot of kids. But I don't think most are going to have 20
*  touchdowns and I get it. That stuff is going to catch up to them but they're a bad January team.
*  They're not good in cold weather but I do have them. They're one of these nine and a halfs that
*  I think could get to 10. You really have to make a decision on it. I'm not against it. If they get
*  to 10 they're making the playoffs and there were just other teams that I like better. I still,
*  you know it's funny football is weird. We're in the middle of it talking about it every day from
*  September through January right? Yeah. And then seven months passed and you just kind of forget
*  shit. And I think Miami is one of those teams where like the last time we saw them they were
*  rolling over and dying against Kansas City. Terrible. They wanted no part of the cold weather.
*  JJ who we watched the game with our friend who's a Dolphins fan. I called the JJ couch the dead
*  JJ couch that he just was basically sunk into as the game went on. There's like basically a chalk
*  outline. Yeah. It was so bad and now their team is worse. So why am I supposed to get excited about
*  them? Also the leagues had like another, it's almost like what happened in the Eagles last year. The
*  leagues had another year now to kind of figure out some of the shit they're doing. And I just
*  think the variance for them is shades the wrong way. But this is why I hate this division. If you
*  told my Miami was going to win the division, I wouldn't be shocked. We just know who's going
*  to be in fourth place. But we know it's going to be a four point win games. Right? So they led in
*  total offense 40 plus points a game. They led in yards per play last year. I still think that
*  offense is there. I have them as a second half swimming team because their schedule,
*  they go home Jacksonville, home Buffalo on a Thursday night too, which is a nice advantage
*  for them at Seattle, home Tennessee at Pat's and then a bi-week. But then right around week nine
*  where we go at Buffalo at Rams, but then the last six games at green band a Thursday,
*  home jets at Houston, San Francisco at Cleveland at the jets. It's a gauntlet stuff. And we see
*  these teams, there's two every year that just die when they get to like week 10, week 11.
*  They're kind of a candidate anyway, just because of the type of team they have. And it's like a
*  warm weather team. This might be one of your, like you talked about teams that get off to a
*  hot start and then you can bet them to not make the playoffs if you like that. Right. They should
*  be for the other way on them. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm going under, they field nine and eight to me,
*  and it could actually go worse if something happens to Tua. Like we're just penciling in
*  Tua now for 17 starts a year. Right. I don't know. Something's off with that. I got them at 10. So
*  if you have nine, 10. So we've disagreed three and around. And I think we're going to disagree
*  here too. The case for them is that is like the jets, they're loaded. Like they have Phillips,
*  Baker, Howard Fuller, Ramsey, Holland on defense. Those guys are all good. They got two good
*  receivers. They have speed in the Tua piece. So maybe they get out so strong September,
*  October, then they could kind of hold on the last six weeks. I don't feel great about going
*  under with them, but I'm going to do it. I feel awesome about this next team, the New England
*  Patriots, my beloved Pats, the worst team I think we've had since I was a senior in college.
*  The offensive line is so bad and all the Pats fans have been talking about it. And then finally,
*  they're on the last game of the year, Sunday night, Collinsworth and Torrico. Drake may has a couple
*  really nice throws. Cause oh, Mike, oh my God, Mike, this kid, what do you see? How did he do that?
*  You gotta love the Drake. This kid, he's 21 years old, Mike. And then five minutes later,
*  he's running for his life on every single play because we have no left tackle. We have no right
*  tackle and we have no center that can snap a ball. Now it was the backup center in there,
*  but it is an absolute travesty. They have 50 million in calf space though, which I guess you
*  can roll it over like it's a skin in golf. But the QB coach combo is in the bottom three in the league.
*  Like I would, I would in my ranking system, I'll do a minus two if the QB or the coach is that bad.
*  I did minus four for that combo. You don't like that. He called out where he basically announced
*  the starter where he didn't have to. Yeah. He's talking about how May is playing better than
*  Brissette, but we'll see what happens. It's like, okay, cool. So if you don't play May,
*  that means you're telling us your offensive line is so terrifying that you don't want to put your
*  21 year old QB in front of it. But now you're just throwing this other guy to the, like you can't.
*  Right. I have something for you. I have a little gift. This is something. No, don't get nervous.
*  It's actually a nice, it's somewhere between stupid and nice. And it's going to live in
*  after Kyle's garage, I'm guessing like 10 minutes after this, but this is a pylon signed by
*  Drake May. Really? Yep. Isn't that nice? Why are you laughing, Kyle? It's a delightful gift.
*  This is great. And then like anytime he dives for the pylon and loses the ball,
*  you'll think of me, right? Or get sacked by the pylon. Yeah. How did you get such a great thing?
*  I know so many people. You're like red and shoshank. Unbelievable. Thanks, Sal. No, of course.
*  I love Drake May. And the only thing that matters this season is that Drake May doesn't get hurt.
*  That he doesn't get put in a situation like what Carolina did to Bryce Young last year, where they
*  just threw him the wolves and he got the shit kicked out of them and ran for his life and had
*  no skill position guys. The Pats have bottom three receivers in the league. Berset's probably the
*  worst quarterback in the league or in the top three. The offensive line has to be the worst.
*  All right. They're terrible. So I'm looking at some of these bets. First of all, here's the
*  sign for you. Like they're over four and a half right now with some juice on the over,
*  which I don't understand. The under for me is my first lock. Worst record,
*  which a month ago was plus 550 is now plus 260. Yeah, because of you, you're screaming about how
*  bad they're going to be. It's not my fault. They can't block. When did you really turn up? I feel
*  like you were maybe going over until the Jude on trade. Barmore getting hurt. There was a case for
*  them to have a top five defense and Barmore went out with blood clots and he's the best guy in the
*  defense. And once they did that, I think they decided to trade Jude on. They needed both of
*  those guys to have some push and some, but this was not going to be a 10 win team. So you understand
*  that's a probably a smart trade to get rid of Jude on. It was 32 years old. It was a great trade.
*  I'm not against straight in Jude on. The offense is going to be, I mean, I don't know what the
*  record is for least amount of points. There were some crazy Jets numbers last year where I can't
*  believe this. We're going to be talking Celtics week three, cause you're already out. I have all
*  these, this is why we gamble. I'm going to have, this is how I learned to gamble in college. Cause
*  the Patriots are terrible. Let me make a case for that. Can I do one more? Sure. Go ahead. Under
*  three and a half wins is plus two 40. And I think that might be my favorite bet of any future.
*  I don't, I looked at their schedule and I honestly cannot come up with four wins. I went through it a
*  million times. There's a lot of winnable games. They're there. If the Jaguars are good and we'll
*  talk about them in a second, they don't even have Seattle, giant Chicago, Titans, Cardinals, Colts.
*  These are not Titans. These are sick. You know, anywhere from six to eight wins and maybe four,
*  who know they go to London, Jacksonville. There's always a surprise in the vision. You know,
*  they're going to beat the jet somehow. I don't think there's a lot of room if you take the under,
*  I think like, Oh, there's going to be room and I take the under three and a half. I mean,
*  those winnable games, I haven't met five and 12. I could be wrong, but I think they play with a
*  little pride for, I'm going under lock. Wow. The only other person who seems to see what I'm seeing
*  is Lombardi. And there's this whole Belichick thing to it too, where Belichick, he's the worst
*  drafter free agent due to this decade, probably in the NFL. Like nobody missed on more picks and
*  did more dumb signings. I fully can see that, but their defense was for what, for losing Gonzales
*  and Giudon early in the year. It was still, it was top 10. And not having an offense. Their defense
*  kept them in every single game. And now they have Mayo, who's never coached before, pretty inexperienced
*  coaching staff. Alex van Pelt, who's the offensive coordinator, Cleveland fired last year.
*  You know, they're going to have a bottom five or six coaching staff. They're going to be tough to
*  stay in the top 10 defensively, but they took some hits. They have no home field advantage either,
*  Sal. People aren't going to go to these games. Oh, he called me Sal. I know he's serious now.
*  Sal? Well, just to call me out by name. I'm just like, that's how serious this is. I used your
*  first name. I understand it does seem like Barmore and then Giudon getting traded. And they used eight
*  of their nine draft picks on offensive players, which is not Patriots way at all. So it seems
*  like they're going the wrong way. Well, the other thing, they really, they needed a left tackle.
*  They had, I think like the third pick in the third round and they should have traded up and
*  taken the guy that the chiefs ended up taking, who went like second to last pick in the
*  second round. Who everybody's like, this guy's awesome. He's going to be our left tackle for 10
*  years. It's like, of course the chiefs have outwitted somebody again. They kind of did it to the
*  Bills too. If this is worthy guy works out and they traded that. Yeah. Right. So I think it's
*  going to be rough. You can get them at a hundred to one for the AFC or 300 to one to win the Super
*  Bowl. Do you just do the 300 and then hedge once they make the Super Bowl or do you do the 100?
*  100. Because I have like one year where I'm able to do it. One year we've been bad this whole decade.
*  I'm picking you over. I think you get to five. Wow. So we disagree on every single AFC East
*  team. Yeah. Jesus. Look, I'm going to be wrong, but about at least half. And you have no locks
*  in this division? No, no locks. I really do have it within a half a game for all of them. All right.
*  I have under Pat's four and a half block. All right. We got someone to that Pat segment. I
*  forgot to set you up. You're going to prop for every division. Yeah. I like this player prop.
*  Tyreek Hill. You heard of him 13 plus conceived, no receiving touchdowns plus 360. I don't
*  understand this number two of the last four years. He's hit this 13 and 15 touchdowns
*  as 119 catches each of the last two years. 13 TDs plus 360. Yeah. Why not? I mean, if you play
*  17 games, he's probably hitting the whole thing. Yeah. All right. AFC North. This is one that I,
*  I basically went to the buffet and tried a bunch of different things. I'm like,
*  oh, the teriyaki beef. I'll put that on my plate. Oh, there's some chicken. And just, and then at
*  the end you just go back, you just throw up. No, then you just go back. You know what I should
*  have gotten is just the prime rib looks. I should have just gotten that. That's Baltimore. You go
*  and you bounce around and you look for all these reasons not to take them. And there are some
*  reasons. They lost Patrick Queen. Their offensive line is definitely unequivocally worse.
*  Mike McDonald's who did a great job as their defensive coordinator is now coaching Seattle.
*  They led the league in turnover differential, which usually shifts back to the, to the middle
*  the next year. They beefed up at cornerback. Everybody likes the first rounder they took.
*  They added Derek Henry, who's going to be really fun to watch on this team.
*  But Sal, they're over under is 10 and a half. I am going over. I'm also taking them for the
*  division at plus one 45. And it comes down to this Lamar's 58 and 19 as a starter. Like just
*  don't overthink it. Sometimes when he's healthy, they win three out of every four games. Sounds
*  good. It's divisions. Very good though. It's very tough. You know, that you, you're not going to run
*  the table on it. You can't go six at all. It's just too, too hard hitting too physical. I'm with
*  you. If you go under, you're asking for a three game regression. Cause I won 13 games last year,
*  but something about replacing the defensive coordinator and your best defensive player,
*  it just doesn't sit right with me. I just don't think you're zagging. Yeah, I'm zagging five in
*  a row. This is crazy. I read that stat. How, if you agree with the both of us, then we go crazy.
*  But yeah, again, I think they win 10 games. I just can't get them to 11. He's a great regular
*  season quarterback for toughest schedule in football at KC Vegas, at Dallas Buffalo,
*  since he to start. So if you want to jump on that to win a division, you might get better odds by
*  week five, if they're three and two or after week five. So I think they lost a lot, you know,
*  Roquan Smith and Lamar deals bankrupted the team. They lost 15 players in free agency. You went over
*  most of them. I think it's a very competitive division. It almost doesn't matter who the
*  quarterbacks are for the other teams. I guess the question for me is they went 13 and four last year.
*  And I just need them to go 11 and six this year to hit the over, which I think would also be good
*  enough to win the division. So is this team three wins worse? And I just don't see it. I could see
*  two wins worse, but three seems ambitious. Last year in the playoffs, they beat Houston and they
*  had that 17 to 10 loss against KC that they were home. They were home. They scored 10 points and
*  they sucked. And it made me so mad. But I mean, it was, I think I bet them over the most upsetting.
*  I had a really good playoffs. That was the most upsetting. I just hated it. And yet it felt like
*  there were like two, three plays where they could have actually stolen that game somehow. Like KC
*  didn't do anything like the last two hours of the game. Right. But I think you're right. We carry
*  the biases from, we remember from January, you didn't because you're still going over,
*  but with Miami and Baltimore, and I know you're going to pound Dallas, even though DAC is a good
*  regular season quarterback. Like we remember what happens in January, but we're doing over under.
*  So that's just the September through December. Top five coaching staff. And if the things that
*  I'm supposed to be worried about are they lost Patrick Queen and their O-line's worse.
*  We've seen teams patch together the O-line, you know, it does that the part that as I kept
*  like thinking about it, you dare Kenry, but then you don't have that good of an O-line. And I was
*  like, what's that? So what if he's just getting hit behind the line and you spend $52 and your
*  fantasy league on it? It's like 15 carries for 31 yards. And you're like, oh my God, they can't
*  block. I just feel like that coaching staff will figure it out. All right. They've done it. They
*  do it year after year. But not the Patriots. You can't patch together an offensive line. All right.
*  I have them at 10. You have them at 11. They have this. So they have their bi-weeks, week 14.
*  They're at the Giants, week 15, home Pittsburgh, home Houston on that Wednesday Christmas game,
*  four days later, and then home for Cleveland. So, and I think that Wednesday game, the home
*  team must have the advantage. Christmas with no days rest basically. Yeah. You would think.
*  So I feel like if they can get to, can they be seven and six heading into that four and then
*  sweep it? If they're eight and five, they'll go three and one. From a talent standpoint, talent
*  everywhere. The Zay Flowers, you'd feel like he's not a top 10 receiver, but he's at least
*  finally a number one for Lamar. Yeah. I hate his guts too because of that January game.
*  I think the same kind of thing, but yeah, he'll do well in regular season. All right. Well,
*  we're going for six in a row now. The Cincinnati Bengals over 10 and a half,
*  minus 120, the action on that division plus 165 playoffs minus 230. You can take it for
*  number one seed at 701. I really tried to talk myself into this one. Which way? Pro.
*  They played 11 playoff teams last year.
*  Got better at safety.
*  If you're going to ding them, ding them on bad running backs, probably bottom five with your
*  team being 32nd in the league running backs. So bad that there's been some Dalvin Cook,
*  never looked better. That'd be nice. He used to be good. Sketchy cornerbacks and they lost
*  DJ Reader who was a stud for them. It comes down to this for me. I'm going under because I am more
*  scared of Joe Burrow's wrist than any other NFL body part, including anything on Tyreek Hill.
*  I just can't get over the wrist thing. He doesn't seem 100% to me. I feel like they've been dancing
*  around it. Our ringer fantasy guys, they feel like that's like a do not draft list the entire team.
*  Because if something's really wrong with Burrow, that's also going to affect Chase.
*  It's too frightening to me. I can't do it. I'm going slight under. 10 and a half. It feels like
*  a nine and eight or a 10 and seven. Well, I defer to you because you're an expert in
*  wrist mobility. We've said that for years. You've talked to your colleagues. You know a lot about
*  the wrist. I'm with you. So we finally have. Wow, we did it. Yeah. I love Burrow. When he's at his
*  best, he is top two. You talked about top two or top three. I love watching him in January, but he's
*  got to be seen as a legitimate risk at this point. He has three majorish injuries in his career.
*  So I don't know, but it is weird that you look at it and I'm going to conflict too. It's kind of
*  like this jet situation. They were nine and eight last year. Why can't they get to 11 with Burrow?
*  But you're okay with Rogers. But yeah, I'm with you. I'm not buying the Burrow buzz cut.
*  Reeder is a big run stopper. Their offensive line is still in the bottom 10. Every other year,
*  they protect him. Lu Anarumo, we would scream in his praises and that defense just fell apart. It
*  was top five passing yards allowed. 11 and six, they always get off to a slow start. They lose
*  their first two or two out of three for no reason. So could easily lose three in a division. They have
*  KC Dallas. I think they screw up somewhere else along the way. I'm going under. Yeah, they start
*  out with the Pats. So we know that they're going one and O. But then at KC week two, home Washington,
*  Monday night at Carolina week four. And if they're not three and one coming out of that,
*  potentially four and O, but at least three and one, if they're like two and two coming out of that,
*  it gets worse and worse and worse. They have an app Baltimore at the Chargers combo in the middle
*  of the season. They're playing at Dallas. They play at Pittsburgh and Cleveland, all the NFC.
*  The case for them, they have some easy, you know, they have New England, Carolina, Denver, the
*  Giants, Tennessee, Washington and Las Vegas. Last place schedule, right? Yeah. So
*  that's what gave me pause. But I just feels like if the over under was nine and a half,
*  I feel like I might go over on it. But the 10 and a half, the 11 and six seems ambitious.
*  I also like the wild card for them a plus 190. If you just thought those odds would be lower,
*  if the Ravens win the vision, yeah, just for that's been you're basically better in the Bengals to be
*  a playoff team. There's a catastrophic one where it's the under of seven and a half wins is plus
*  440. Interesting. So that would be the something's really wrong with Joe Burrow bet. Right. I can't
*  get there. So I don't have two quarterbacks. 11 is a big number for the injured quarterback. So I went
*  under on Burrow and I went under on Josh Allen, two of my favorite quarterbacks in the league,
*  but I just don't like the situations. All right. Well, we finally agreed on one. Also, not a lot
*  of talent on this team anymore. That's the other thing. Like I only had five chippers on the team,
*  Burrow, Chase, T Higgins barely, Hendrickson and Stone. And then Taylor's, I think in that like,
*  what, nine to 13 coaching range. Right. It's good coach. Right in there. They need the kid from
*  Georgia at 18 Mims to pan out on offensive line. Because like I said, you know how that goes with
*  them. Would you see about how big their offensive line is? It's the heaviest offensive line in the
*  league. I don't really know what that means. Yeah. They have the heaviest and I think Philly's second
*  where it's like almost 1,700 pounds of people on their offensive line. I kind of like that. All
*  right. So we agreed on one. Next one is Cleveland. I think we're going to agree on this. No, I don't
*  think we are. Go ahead. You don't think we are? Well, over eight and a half, a lot of juice on
*  the over minus one 38. They are plus four 50 for the division. They're plus one 38 to make
*  the playoffs. If you're banking on the Sean, just absolutely murdering them this year, the under for
*  six and a half wins is plus 300. The under for seven half wins on Fandl is plus one 84. They were
*  11 and six last year with Joe burrow for a few of those wins. And then the playoffs started
*  and Houston absolutely beat the living out of them. They lost 45 to 14. Their defense was awesome at
*  home and shaky on the road. And it feels like they're worse. The Denzel word has another
*  concussion. Said five. So you got that. Their offensive line is a hundred percent, no question
*  worse. And their left tackle, my nephew right for the first week. All right. They tried to trade
*  Amari Cooper that floated out there. I never liked when that happens. They were six and two and one
*  scored games in 2023. Usually reverts a little. Here's the biggest thing for me is no first round
*  picks in 2022, 23 or 24. When you miss a three year cycle of just not adding anybody awesome,
*  I think there's damage. And I, my take on this going under is this is the year that is Sean trade
*  officially morphs into shape as the worst NFL trade of all time. Wow. Well, I think he's
*  unsalvageable. This is the big test, but I will say this, do you know what his record was last
*  year? He did play a bunch of games. Yeah. It's five and one last year. Sean Watson was five and one.
*  And I don't know which way you want to go with this, but this team won without Nick Chubb and
*  they won with four or five quarterback. I think they started their fifth quarterback in week 18.
*  So pretty damn good. And I think it's because of that defense, which you're right, showed up at home
*  and not on the road, but for the first two months, that was a top 10 defense of the century. Leading
*  podcast. Right. Miles Garrett, defensive player of the year last year. You know, they re-signed
*  to Daria Smith at five and a half sacks. He's practicing again. I think it's a top three defense.
*  You know, they brought in Devin Bush and Jordan Hicks. So you're in. It's it. I'm, I'm not only
*  am I in, this is my division winner. Wow. I know Joe house and Joe house is with me only because
*  Joe house is with you. Yes. What else do I need? I don't need anything else. Oh man. I'm sorry.
*  Plus four 50 is way too high. These, these teams all beat up on each other. They were great last
*  year. I think the, why couldn't they do it? The Watson thing just seems like it's never been worse.
*  Five and one that surprised you when I said he was five and one last year, but he was.
*  And Joe is a great tight end. They have receivers. They have Cooper, Elijah Moore, Judy. This guy
*  thrashed from Louisville. It's been good in the preseason, the rookie. I really like it.
*  It's a really good offensive line. I'm just worried about that first week, which is one of
*  their most important games because they're playing your team and Mike Parsons. And that's the week
*  where their offensive line might be a little dingy, but yeah, I had them, I had them as a top five
*  offensive line. If they could actually get healthy and let's say Conklin's coming back. There you go.
*  I can't get there. I think the Watson thing suddenly and it ruins it for me. I just don't,
*  what about Jamis? I look for, I look for comeback player of the year. They're caring for quarterbacks.
*  But we know Jamis isn't a starter. Like how many years in a row can he get a chance?
*  But did you know Flacco wasn't a starter? Any guy they put in there last year like that to one,
*  to win? If Jamis is playing, count me in on betting against the Browns.
*  I love this team. You love this team.
*  I don't know why. I really do. I mean, I think it's crazy to have them at eight and a half after what
*  they did last year. It's because of Deshaun. This is, this is-
*  They're starters back. You've read some of the stories, right? Like he's like defiant.
*  I haven't read Hang On. Don't ruin it for me. I haven't read anything about him. I don't know
*  anything about the guy. I think the vibes are all wrong.
*  Okay. And last year was and everything somehow went right last year, even though nothing was
*  going right and that never works twice. I have for this year's Browns in the division, not the
*  Browns, the Pittsburgh Steelers, over eight and a half plus 116. So you actually get a little plus
*  action on the over playoffs plus 194. I think their defense is going to be the best defense
*  in either conference. And I try to talk myself out of it because their schedule is just horrifying.
*  That's it. Yeah. This gauntlet they have from week 11 on home Baltimore at Cleveland at
*  Cincy, home Cleveland at Philly at Baltimore, home Casey at Cincy and the Baltimore Casey
*  are Saturday, Wednesday combo. So the reasons to pick them are that and Russell Wilson,
*  Russell Wilson still way better than Kenny Pickett last year.
*  Look, he went, what did he go? Eight, nine in Denver. I guess he didn't play the last
*  couple of games for them, but they were, you know, they weren't a disaster. Pickett was a
*  disaster for Pittsburgh. I don't like Russell Wilson, but the one thing he could do is take a
*  whatever step drop and wing it downfield and wing it downfield to receivers running fast.
*  And he doesn't make turnovers. All they need is no turnovers. Can you just throw it deep?
*  This is going to be a team that just wants to win 16-13, 19-16, 17-10. That's who they are.
*  They're the Browns from last year. I have them as over and I have them as a playoff team.
*  Wow. I have them over. I think I have them right at nine. I don't have them as a playoff team,
*  but I like all your reasoning. I think if these guys stay healthy, like right with Queen and Watt
*  and Hayward and Highsmith could be top five that we've seen in a long time. Joey Porter,
*  Jr. coming along. They got Dante Jackson from the Panthers for cornerback. Cam Sutton suspended
*  for the first eight games, which is not great. I wish the quarterback were a little better and I
*  wish that schedule allowed them for two weeks where they can come up for air. Well, one thing
*  is it really seems like they have a good offensive line this year, which is different than previous
*  years. They spent number 20 and number 51 picks on O-line. Yeah. They seem pretty happy with it.
*  This was another thing that jumped out to me. First of all, they made the playoffs last year.
*  They were 10-7. So the over-under is they're two less for whatever reason. They've spent $165 million
*  in cap on their defense, which is $25 million more than any other team in the league. To say they've
*  loaded up is the all-time understatement. On top of the fact that their defense was hurt last year,
*  Watt missed a bunch of games. Fitzpatrick missed a bunch of games. Cam Hayward was banged up.
*  If they can get all those dudes together, I just think it's going to be this year's Browns defense.
*  Definitely. Six AFC North games in the final eight. I have second best division in your mind.
*  In the whole thing? Out of either conference.
*  In the NFC North. I have one division I like more.
*  You like the NFC North better. I don't want to spoil it.
*  There's one I like more. It's not the AFC South.
*  Well, I'm trying to raise suspense. This is the second best division though.
*  I like that start is interesting because I think they got to go two and one or three and oh, right?
*  At Atlanta, that's the Arthur Smith game, right? At Denver, obviously the Russell Wilson game,
*  and then the Chargers, which, well, they're home for it anyway. It would have been home
*  even if it were on the road. Definitely a start that they have to capitalize on.
*  Yeah. I don't even know what the odds are. I'll have to look this up during the break,
*  but the odds for Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Cincy, Cleveland as the exact order,
*  that's got to be like 20 to one, right? Baltimore, Pittsburgh.
*  Pittsburgh is the second one. This is so hard to pick the four.
*  We have a couple of exact orders we really like.
*  I think this helps if you know the first place team and you know the fourth place team,
*  and then move from there. So that's 16 to one.
*  Is it? Yeah. I kind of like that. Give us your prop for this division. What is it?
*  Ravens to score a touchdown in every game is minus 115. In December 2022, the Browns held them
*  scoreless. Oh, they scored three. They didn't score a touchdown. It's happened once in 93 games.
*  You're getting even odds for something that's happened once in 93 games. I really like it.
*  Obviously a lot of talent. You could have bad luck in a rainy December game maybe, but the Ravens
*  score. They get in the end zone. I like it. Thank you. I'm trying to think of how that would go
*  wrong. The offensive line's not great. Maybe there's a game where they just can't get it done inside
*  the 20. Yeah, they might have a couple of games where they score 10, but I think they're less
*  reliant on Tucker, believe it or not. The other case against Baltimore that I considered is just
*  that Lamar has had seasons where he'll just miss like some games and he was healthy last year.
*  It was in the back of my head. My two big predictions for this division are the Borough thing.
*  I don't like the odor of that. I think this Watson thing's just done. I think he's going to be the
*  most unpopular player in his city in the AFC by November because I think the team's pretty good.
*  I just don't think he's good. I don't think he has it. I don't know if he knows how to lead a team
*  anymore. I don't know if that's the end of their season if he's not good. If they catch it early
*  enough, they'll get maybe a Bailey's Appie to come in there and save the day. So you have
*  Bailey's Appie. So you have Cleveland as the awesome defense team and I have Pittsburgh.
*  Yeah. All right. We'll see what happens. Coming back with the AFC where everybody
*  is on the Houston bandwagon to the point that- I'm sorry, by the way, I didn't have a gift for you
*  for that division. I should have brought a gift for you for everyone. Yeah, that would have been nice.
*  Houston. We're like that. I don't know what your gift would have been for this division, but-
*  Our gift would have been we skip it because we never get it right.
*  You think it's this division we don't get right? We're getting it right this year. I feel really
*  good about this division. Houston, over nine and a half wins. There's juice on that. Division is
*  plus 105. Conference plus 800. Number one seed plus 800. 12 plus wins is plus 225. And if you
*  want to go nuts and vote them best record 14 and one, they made round two of the playoffs last year
*  were 10 and seven. They loaded up. Pass rush is better. D backs are better. They added Joe Mixon.
*  They're going to be healthier. Their offensive line is healthier. Year two, CJ Stroud. They had
*  the number one offensive DVOA. If you're going to go worse, Autry suspended for six games. They had
*  good turnover luck last year. Won't be the same. They have a weird schedule where like the first
*  six games are easy. Weeks 12 through 15 are easy. And then the rest of the schedule is hard.
*  I'm going to go here. So I'm going over if CJ Stroud is special, which I think he is,
*  I think he's just in the 10 to 11 wins club from now on that these other guys are in. If he's
*  going to be healthy and you're getting a good team, he should win 11 games from now on going forward.
*  I'm back in the Houston Texans, not only to win this division,
*  not only to win the conference, but to make the Superbowl. Wow. The Houston Texans. The Superbowl?
*  The Superbowl. There's one Superbowl this year. The Houston Texans in the Superbowl. I feel like a
*  jackass for taking them under now, but I also kind of love it. Yeah. You love this act on me? I do.
*  I think Stefan Diggs ruined CJ Stroud. He's a third receiver. He's fine. Yeah, I know,
*  but he's going to be eyeballing him when he doesn't get like six targets in a row. He's just running
*  12, 13 over the middle. No, they didn't sign him to be a third receiver. CJ Stroud is cool.
*  I know. He's one of the coolest initial names of all time. All right. I don't want to get into it.
*  His podcast stuff has been great. I loved watching him last year. I interviewed him on Radio Row. He's
*  tremendous. He could play in the NBA. I'm in on CJ Stroud now. I liked it. It took me a while. I
*  didn't trust the Ohio State thing and the fact that his name was CJ. Yeah, you didn't like that.
*  I didn't like it. First place schedule now. It's just a different ball game. Everyone's gunning
*  for you. By the way, if you look at their games last year, Stroud was impressive. The rest of the
*  team kind of wasn't. It's hard to explain, but just go through of them. Not too many impressive
*  games. Well, they had one receiver. Dell got hurt halfway through the year. One of the other
*  receivers was her. They were basically playing with Nico Collins and Schultz. Right. But the
*  Colts were bad. They took advantage of it. They faced seven playoff teams this year, three in the
*  conference finals last year. I think this is tough. I know it's easy early on schedule-wise. I'm not
*  going to say they're going to be a bad team. I could see them going nine and eight. Danil Hunter
*  is a good compliment to Will Anderson. He had 16 sacks, but watch the Stefan Diggs. He is going to
*  be a story starting week two. You're that. You really think the third receiver on a really good
*  team could single handedly. They'll just cut them. Is nine and a half the Vegas zone for over-Unders?
*  I feel like it's such a trap. There's been more nine and a halfs this year than ever before.
*  Well, so here's the case against Houston. By the way, I'm going to pick somebody else to make the
*  Super Bowl later. I just wanted to get your reaction for Houston. I have a second Super Bowl pick.
*  Oh wow. This is going to be some game. Nobody's ever done it. I researched it. Nobody's ever
*  picked two Super Bowl teams in one conference. If you go with the can't believe they missed the
*  playoffs list and the kind of can't believe it list, which I told you before, it's like between
*  minus plus 125 and plus 160. So last year the teams that missed Jets plus 110, Saints plus 126,
*  and Jaguars plus 160. This year to miss the playoffs, Bills plus 128, Green Bay plus 128,
*  Miami plus 128. You're going down the line. Houston's plus 154 to miss the playoffs. They're
*  basically like come bet on this. And I look at that list Bills, Green Bay, Miami, Jets, Atlanta,
*  Houston, Dallas, trying to find two, three teams from that. And I could see Houston.
*  This is from the kind of can't believe it.
*  Kind of can't believe it, but there's always three of them that make it.
*  Yeah.
*  So anyway, that would be the case is there's too many people on the bandwagon to the point.
*  For sure.
*  I really like the team though.
*  The biggest problem against it is it's a very winnable division. Right. And I've gone back and
*  forth with these teams. One other thing I should have mentioned, Ryan's the top five coach now.
*  Has anybody been raved about who's coming to the league as a coach in the last five years?
*  Everybody fucking loves him. So they're basically nailing the QB coach thing. It's like the reverse
*  of Berset and Mayo or Antonio Pearson, Gardner, Mitchie. They have the opposite where they're
*  just like, if you're going to rank both those categories, one to 10, they have like a 10 and
*  a 10. And a good enough team to put around those dudes. I'm in.
*  All right. I'm slightly on there. So I think we still agree on like two.
*  Yeah.
*  Jacksonville, eight and a half is the over division plus two 70. If you want to go nuts
*  and have them for 11 plus wins plus two 50 playoffs plus one 16. This is my favorite
*  team to discuss in the AFC. They went nine and eight the last two years.
*  There's your Superbowl team, right?
*  This is going to be my second Superbowl pick. Last year, there are eight and three and fell apart.
*  Trevor Lawrence, I tried to add it up. He had four injuries. He hurt his knee, his shoulders,
*  ankle and concussion to the point that even I was out on him. Even last week when I was doing the pod
*  with Stephen Ruiz was talking about them. I was like, yeah, I'm out. And then I did my final round
*  of research this week and I was like, this is just a classic zag team. Just classic by load.
*  Nobody's on them. And if you actually look and you go under the hood and you look at the engines,
*  they were eight and three last year and just weird shit happened. They definitely got better.
*  They added Eric Armstead. They beat up their defensive line. It seems like they lucked out
*  Brian Thomas Jr. at receiver. He's the best receiver Lawrence has had. They have a new center.
*  They took Buffalo Center. You know, they were 10th in DBOA last year on defense, Jacksonville.
*  Yeah. And that's before their big guy changed his name. It's not Josh Allen or Josh Allen Hines or
*  something like that. I like it. It's a hype move. And really the only way they got worse was they
*  lost Calvin Ridley, but they replaced him with Thomas. So the over seems like a gift. Eight and
*  a half. They got to get nine and eight. I think they go 10 and seven. Good. We agree here. Great.
*  And you know, the London games are becoming theirs, right? Right. They've won five out of six and now
*  they have Chicago and New England. So, and they stay there. So they have a tough start. This is
*  another one you might want to wait on before you pick them to win the division or something.
*  Although you have Houston going to the Super Bowl. So you're not going to do that at Miami,
*  Cleveland at Buffalo at Houston. So you might want to wait. You're right about Armstead takes
*  away the double teams from Trayvon Walker and Josh Allen Hines. So they're going to be able to rush
*  the passer. They're going to be able to throw the ball. The London thing has turned into one of the
*  biggest advantages in the league. And especially they're going to be playing Chicago and the Pats
*  back to back. I'm just penciling those for kids. If you gave the Chargers an opportunity to beat
*  the home team in London, they would take it in a second. Right. You've got to fly like 14,000 miles
*  but still worth it. So they were a really good team, Jacksonville for a year and a half. Yeah.
*  And then we just dropped it because they fell down the stretch. And there's a Lawrence piece
*  to this season with them that if he has it, we kind of have to see it. I think this year he's
*  got CJ Stroud in the division now and that's a potential rivalry. That could be really fun,
*  but you know, he's kind of out of excuses. If he's a franchise, they paid him like a franchise.
*  Yeah, he got a huge contract. Yep. He's got weapons. They've spent a lot of capital,
*  free agent capital, draft pick capital, just trying to get him receivers and weapons and
*  Travis Etienne and all that stuff. I just feel like it has to happen this year. And I like their
*  schedule. They end with Las Vegas, Tennessee, yeah, and the Indianapolis. That's what I was going to say.
*  So if they're in it, it's right there for them at the end. Yeah. Last five is at Tennessee,
*  home jets, at Vegas, home Tennessee, at Indy. Yeah. Ten wins feels great. Gabe Davis, Christian
*  Kirk, Zay Jones, and Brian Thomas is a good solid, you know, it's like no Tyree kills in there,
*  but they're all going to get the job done. I think. All right. We're both over. Yep. Next
*  one is Indianapolis. A very tough one to figure out. There are over as eight and a half, some juice
*  on that plus one on four divisions, plus three, 10 playoffs, plus one 52. If you're excited about
*  them, you can also go under seven F wins plus one 72 on Fandl last year. They're nine and eight with
*  Mintchou. And if you're going to say here's how they're better, I really like their receiver as a
*  group with Pittman downs, Mitchell, the rookie, everybody's going nuts about Pierce, like four
*  good receivers, like as a combo. Jonathan Taylor, no drama with him this year. Latu as a pass rusher,
*  they drafted him maybe. And then the Richardson piece, but the Richardson thing, I can't get there.
*  I want to see it. And if I'm wrong, I'm wrong, but I'm not going over on them until I see him
*  complete a bunch of passes. I know it's all there. He's basically like Cam Newton,
*  2.0, whatever you want to call it, but I want to see it. And from what I've seen in the preseason
*  and what I've read, he seems really raw. Not to mention he got hurt twice last year. So Flacco is
*  their backup, ironically. Right. I couldn't get there. Yeah. I took him under also. So we'll agree
*  on this one. I also, I think when did these overrunners come out in like March or something?
*  I must've flip flopped on the Colts 15 times. I'll probably flip flop during this segment. I'll
*  probably go back. I might pick them to the over. Yeah. You already have them in your Super Bowl.
*  But they were weird last year. First of all, they're 0-9 and one in week one games in the last 10.
*  So count that as a loss against Houston. Their rest advantage goes from plus four to minus 17.
*  That's big. Last year they won nine games without their starter, but they also played 10 quarterback
*  rookies or backups. Right. So you go and I don't want to lend too much credence to the preseason,
*  but I got that same feeling with Anthony Richardson. Like, why are we going so crazy about this?
*  He feels like he's going to have some great moments and some awful moments. Yeah. And there's going
*  to be times when you like bet on the Colts at home minus four and he just does nine terrible things.
*  There's other games when he does like what Fields did a couple of times for the Bears,
*  where he just single-handedly, athletically just took over the game. We should come up with a
*  category for guys we wouldn't mind having on our fantasy team because Anthony Richardson's also
*  always. I think he's too high in fantasy. But still you wouldn't want to bet him in a game.
*  He's got to be too high in fantasy. He's higher than CJ Stroud in fantasy, which is nuts because
*  CJ Stroud, well, we'll get to him when we do the cops. They end New England, Denver, Tennessee,
*  Giants, all cold weather. So on the road. There's also a world where like Latu is not that good as
*  a pass rush. Taylor is just not the same guy anymore after he's not two years ago. Taylor never
*  comes back. And I like other teams more in the division. All right. We're both under them. And
*  then the last one is Tennessee. The over for them is six and a half. Some juice on that plus 104
*  division plus nine 50 playoffs plus three 60. If you want to go the other way, worst record is 10
*  to one. If you want to go under four point five wins adjusted plus two thirty five.
*  There's six and eleven last year. They lost Mike Vrabel, replaced him with Brian Callahan,
*  drafted a left tackle, spent money on cornerbacks, sneed in a woozy. They signed Ridley.
*  Hopkins is gone for what? Six weeks. Yeah, I think about that. Yeah, they got a boy too.
*  No, Derek Henry drop off to powered.
*  I don't like it at all. Yeah, I don't. I don't either. This is another weird team. You would
*  think they'd be in a rebuilding stage, except they did spend a lot of money. It don't seem like a
*  team that is packing it in this year. But that offensive line is supposed to be like 30th in the
*  league. It's so bad that it's in the vicinity of the Pats offensive line without being as bad.
*  Yeah. But yeah, you have that combined with Will Levesse, who's probably the bravest quarterback
*  in either conference who just takes huge hits. Yeah. So it's like, all right, they can't block.
*  May days in the coffee is great too. Yeah. And this guy loves to just take on everybody.
*  Like he's I don't see him play in 17 games. Malik Willis, they just traded for a seventh round pick.
*  That was funny. Yeah, I look they have 14 1 p.m. games, you know, one prime time game at Miami,
*  which they won last year. That was weird. They're going to get off to a slow start at Chicago Jets,
*  Green Bay and at Miami. So where do you see these seven wins coming from? I don't see it. And I
*  didn't even have an easy stretch for them in the schedule that week 17, seven to 13 stretch,
*  other than that Pats home game is a nightmare and their division is going to be really good.
*  I had in the better or worse. They lost for able and Derek Henry replaced them with the hock to a
*  girl to really Nashville. Right. Yeah, I didn't see that. I think they lost that trade. Wow. Yeah.
*  She's one of that anymore. She's now she's being known by her real name. Oh, yeah. She has a real
*  name. Yeah. No. And what's her real name? She have a real name. How is something? Jack's pretending
*  it. Come on. Haley something. Yeah. How is something? Bill has her going to the Super Bowl.
*  They're at Chicago Week one home jets, home Green Bay at Miami. That feels like an own for
*  me. So we get seven wins the rest of the way. They might have some nice fantasy numbers once
*  while, but their pass rush, even when the Autry gone, it's gonna be even worse.
*  Yeah. And when I did like the chippers, it's Ridley and Simmons and Snead and Stonehouse,
*  one of their special teams guys. And then we're done. And their QBs are minus two.
*  I had them for six points total is one of the one of the lowest stonehouse. I think you're just
*  yeah, I make it up names. Your college friends names. So we have both under six and a half on
*  that. I want to do a borderline lock for that. But yeah, the new coach might not be bad. I was
*  reading about him and I love variable, but they might actually. That's the thing. I probably
*  would have given them extra win just because of variable. But now that he's gone, it's iffy
*  and he might be good. We forgot to mention the Cleveland section that he's helping out
*  Cleveland. The what? In the Cleveland section. Oh, variable. Yeah. Yeah. All right. What do you
*  have for a prop for this? I have Jackson in the division. I have Trevor Lawrence, five or more
*  touchdowns at plus 420. He had five in 2022. He had four last year and set out what a game and a
*  half and was probably injured for more than that. Plus 420 for five rushing touchdowns. Jump on that.
*  It seems pretty good. Yeah. I hope he takes it easy and doesn't hurt our over. That's true.
*  I have a CJ Stroud, most passing yards in the league plus 700.
*  And I have a parlay, which you can do on Fandel on our little
*  parlay thing. Where do we find that? I forgot that I'm going to plug the fusion thing.
*  Futures fusion. Yeah. Mahomes and Stroud both to throw for 4000 yards plus one on one.
*  I'm going to get Fandel to boost that too. You could do that. You have that kind of power.
*  Tell them to boost it. It's going to tell them. You guys boost this. Boost this right now.
*  Boost this. I forgot to mention in the, when we did the AFC is the Bryce Hall rushing title was
*  like nine to one plus nine fifty. Yeah. That seems high. Who else is going to win the rushing title?
*  Can I tell you something? I think you're not doing season leader bets. Have you done? No,
*  I am. But have you done a draft yet? A fantasy draft? No, it's kind of depressing.
*  There used to be like six or eight solid running backs. You have to decide, oh, I got a bit on this
*  guy or I got to take him. Now it's like, no, no, you're nuts. If you don't take B.
*  John Robinson with the fourth pick, I'm like, am I? Bree's all same thing. No, no, he's the best.
*  What happened? I'm in a guillotine draft this year. You are doing well. Somebody wrote me in
*  as their partner and we ended up with the first pick and we took Bree's hall. Yeah.
*  Were you excited about it? You get tingling? Yeah, I got a little tingling. I don't know.
*  What happened to the running backs? I'm just saying these running backs. It's nuts.
*  One last thing in the AFC South. Exact order on FanDuel. Houston, Jacksonville, Indy, Tennessee,
*  plus 650. Would you think about that one? Flipping Jacksonville and Houston? Do both, right? So what's
*  the other way? Jacksonville, Houston, Indy, Tennessee. Eight to one? 10 to one. Wow. Oh,
*  yeah. Do both. There's some of these you could do both. I think it's pretty sick.
*  Because I don't see any world where Jacksonville and Houston are one, two in some direction unless
*  Richardson just becomes amazing. Yeah. So we need Tennessee to come in last basically. People really
*  do like Richardson. I hate like zagging against him, but I just think he's, you're asking a lot,
*  man. You're just going to come in. You missed all last year. Right. I don't know. You're already
*  sending three teams to the Super Bowl from that division. What are you going to do? Well, here's
*  the fourth. AFC West, Kansas City, over 11 and a half wins. Not a lot of juice on that actually.
*  Minus 112. Division minus 270. Conference plus 350. Super Bowl plus 550. Number one seed plus 380.
*  13 plus wins. All adjusted. Plus 186. You go 14 and three. They're plus 330. They do that.
*  How are they better? Might be better at receiver because it looks like Rashid Rice isn't getting
*  suspended and they added Worthy who's just looks like a cheat code and Hollywood Brown. They got
*  rid of Kadera's Tony, which is probably the biggest plus. And Valdez Cantlin. New left tackle,
*  the rookie, Samataya that we talked about earlier that it looks like they stole at the end of the
*  second round. Last year, they had 15 fumbles by people that weren't their QB. Right. Their right
*  tackle alone had 19 penalties. Their receivers had 34 drops, which was third in the league.
*  Turnover differential was fourth worst in the league. Yeah. So it was one of those years they
*  went 11 and six, everything went wrong and they just because they have such good infrastructure
*  pieced it together. One four-star games, one the Super Bowl. It feels like they're better this
*  year. So that's my takeaway. And I went over, I think 12 and five, 13 and four seems realistic
*  to me. So over for me. I went under, but slightly 11 and six and it's stupid probably to bet against
*  them. They're nine and two to the over on their Andy Reed in the last 11, 10 or more wins and 10
*  of the 11 seasons. Their defense is excellent. It's so underrated. They have 57 sacks last year,
*  second. This Steve Spagnola has four rings from being a defensive coordinator. Yeah. You don't
*  hear his name a lot. Maybe I'll say it like four or more, five more times, but I'm looking at
*  their schedule. They have a bye before San Francisco. They're 21 and three after the buys.
*  The only thing I worry about with this team is they saw that they could do it all on the road,
*  which we hadn't seen out of the chiefs until last year. So they won the playoff games on the road.
*  Do they cut back? Do they not try as hard? I don't want to say they don't try as hard in
*  the regular season. Is this something maybe to consider with them? I worry about the Kelsey
*  piece just because he's basically said, I know I have to be ready for four rounds. So he's
*  pacing himself. Someone like that. But I think the fact that they're lying is definitely going to be
*  better. I think makes some of this easier for them. The receivers are definitely going to be better.
*  I talked last week on my pod about this worthy, the way they're using him as he's like this toy
*  for Andy Reed. He's basically like this Tyreek light, discount Tyreek, just send him and all
*  these different weird motion things. Chiefs won the Superbowl. They should have the fastest guy on the
*  planet on it. Let's see what this does. So part of me wonders if the over under is going to come
*  down to that first game of the season against Baltimore, where they're home against Baltimore.
*  It looks like their receivers are going to be a little banged up for that game.
*  And like Joe House loves Baltimore as an underdog already. I just wonder if that's going to be the
*  swing game between 12 games. There used to be a gimme that first Thursday. Yeah, it's not as easy
*  anymore. They're extra games at San Francisco, at Buffalo, Houston. They play the AFC North.
*  I think the question is what do you see them doing in the division? Is it a five and one
*  route or is it four and two? Might not be because the division's better. The biggest reason other
*  than I actually think they're weirdly better than last year, but I was looking at the Pats,
*  the second run of the Pats from basically the 2010s, 2010 through 2019. They were 14 wins, 13, 12,
*  12, 12, 12, 14, 13, 11, 12. They made three Superbowls, two Superbowl losses, three conference
*  finals, eight out of 10 years. Right. And they just were like, I know this is therapeutic.
*  The memories are great. I'm really enjoying myself. Some of those 12s were probably under the win total
*  by the way. But they're just the infrastructure. They had it. The Chiefs from 18 to 23. So that's
*  six years, 12, 12, 14, 12, 14, 11, three Superbowls, one Superbowl loss, two conference finals.
*  And I just think it's stupid to bet against them for any reason, unless they tell us it's time,
*  which the 2019 Pats hit that too, right? It was finally, well, I can't bet against them. And then
*  finally, but at that point we had won every bet year after year after year. And the Chiefs with
*  Mahomes not even in his thirties yet. I just don't see why you would go under. I think you can,
*  because I think they could be 11 and six and we could be looking at each other like, well,
*  they're the best team going into January. Like they could still be 11 and six with that schedule.
*  Black Friday against the Raiders. They'll probably win that Christmas against the Steelers. They have
*  some weird, they play every game day of the week except Tuesday. It's very strange. That's not a
*  lie. They do. They're trying to squeeze them under a Tuesday game. I'll tell you this Superbowl plus
*  550. I like it. I haven't gone to the Superbowl. Well, have we named this? Didn't we say we should
*  just name this fund where you bet Mahomes MVP separately with the Chief Superbowl and every
*  three or four years you'll collect it as a mutual fund. Like just, just going to win.
*  I have Houston KC AFC title game. And I really wanted to take KC for the Superbowl. And I'm
*  joking, obviously I already picked Houston. The three Pete, I couldn't get past it. The fact that
*  we've had the Superbowl since 1967 and we've had all of these awesome teams and nobody's won three
*  Superbowls in a row. Nobody. It hasn't happened once. And I was just like, as I really want to
*  take the Chiefs again, I'm just like, I'm not doing it. And I'm sure we're going to hear the
*  rhetoric next week about, Oh, they'll tell you they don't care about the three people. Trust me,
*  they do. They know nobody in history has done this and all that. I just don't. So they're going to
*  try harder. Like these teams try hard, whatever the situation is. Do we think it's all road? Like
*  we have to mention Taylor Swift there, right? Well, you have that too. Well, I just feel like
*  it's just too easy for them to breeze through everything for the rest of everybody's life.
*  Right. Well, you even think like there was some karma stuff to share with them. Like fucker got
*  in all that trouble. They've had some legal issues, but we know that doesn't work because the Patriots
*  won three Superbowls after Aaron Hernandez. So it's like throw that out the window too. Oh,
*  you admit he's guilty. I'm glad. I do think he might've been guilty. Yeah. I looked at the case
*  again. So the case for Houston beating Casey in the AFC title game around to whenever it happens
*  for me. Cause I was really trying to think like, do I really believe this? I don't want to do like
*  the Nick, right? I'm just throwing crazy takes out, hoping to get aggregated. Sorry, Nick.
*  I really think Houston, if they have the one seed in their home and Casey has to go there and it's
*  in a dome and they have their coach, I could see them beating Casey. Yeah. I'm less bullish on them
*  going to Tara head. So I think part of that Houston case, that's why I like the one seat too.
*  Well, that's why they have to get the one seat. I'm going Buffalo for the conference for that
*  same reason. I think they could do it on the road again, coin flip game against the chiefs last year,
*  Josh Allen, Patrick Mahomes. You're not going to convince me that one is definitely going to
*  play better than the other. So you're picking Buffalo. Buffalo is making the Superbowl.
*  That was your, why didn't you make that pick earlier? I don't know. I didn't, I thought we
*  were waiting on it. I mean, but we did the Buffalo odds. So the Buffalo Superbowl odds,
*  17 to one, nine to one for the conference. You're in on Buffalo. Yeah. Why not? Wow. You said they
*  have a top two quarterback. They do. Okay. Anything else on Casey or should we keep going?
*  Uh, we can keep moving. Okay.
*  The Chargers over eight and a half wins with juice. Everybody loves it. Playoffs plus one 18
*  division plus three 90 11 plus wins plus two 20. Last year, five and 12.
*  The new coach theory. One of my favorites.
*  It's 2022. It hit with day ball on the giants and Peterson and Jacksonville
*  2023 hit with D'Amico Ryan's in Houston. 2024. Our nominees are Mike McDonald in Seattle,
*  Raheem Morris in Atlanta, Harbaugh and the Chargers or Dan Quinn in Washington. Kyle
*  Brandt made the case for Harbaugh on my podcast last week. I completely agree. You go from Branded
*  State to Harbaugh. I don't know how many wins that's worth, but they were five and 12 last
*  year and it's gotta be worth at least four. I am going over, but I'm going a little even more
*  over than that. I have them as a playoff team. Whoa. Yeah. All right. I do. I think they're a
*  year away. I'm going over also. And I hate it because this is one of the few sexy picks that
*  everybody likes and I'm going with it. But Harbaugh comes to town, new energy, maybe new fans. Can they
*  get fans to show up at SoFi? Can they get a home game, an actual home game? You have a better
*  chance of going downtown LA and not being freaked out by somebody. Yeah, that's not gonna happen.
*  I drove downtown LA today to come to the studio and I was like, stink plisskett and escape from
*  New York. I thought the music was going to start playing. I'm sleeping over. I'm not leaving.
*  Gavin is doing a great job. You're gonna figure it. I don't know about this roster though. That's
*  the only thing. Is it as impressive as like Harbaugh can win games? He could do the rah-rah thing.
*  He can get his players stuck in elevators and say it was an accident when he was really just testing
*  them. But is this roster better? I guess Edwards and Dobbins for Eckler is okay. And you know,
*  Kenan Allen and Mike Williams were injury prone. And so now they have Josh Palmer, Lad McConkey,
*  the rookie, DJ Chark. Receivers aren't great, but we've seen good quarterbacks and good coaches win
*  with mediocre receivers. Herbert already being hurt, maybe nervous. Defense getting a little old.
*  Like Bosa is great, but missed 14 games in two years. Mack is 33. I had five guys marked on
*  there. Mack was really good last year though. Bosa, Mack, Samuel, James, and Gilman. Their kicker is
*  awesome. Dicker. They'll win them like two games. And their offensive line is much better. I mean,
*  that's a huge part of, if you're gonna make the case for them, they took Joe Walt, top seven pick,
*  Bozeman, they brought him in. And the Harbaugh vibes, which by all accounts, it's night and day.
*  I mean, you have to remember the new coach there fundamentally comes down to whoever was in there
*  before was like the worst substitute teacher ever. And just like, you know, it was the first 40
*  minutes of a high school movie where you had the worst teacher ever. And then the star of the movie
*  comes in and all of a sudden the kids are studying and they're showing up for the projects. Yeah.
*  Chains the doors. That's Harbaugh. And it always hits. In football, these teams, we have a salary
*  cap. They all have drafts. They all kind of go up and down a little bit. For the most part,
*  the talent's around the same. And if you have a coach that's here, replacing a coach that's here,
*  we know that it works. And they have the quarterback. I'm with you. I mean, listen,
*  it comes down to the Chargers over the last how many years, their most impressive games have been
*  losses every frigging year, four of them. So I think the schedule is going to let them get to
*  at least nine wins. How about this start home Vegas at Carolina to start the year.
*  They're easy QB opponents teams. They're playing that have either, I would say a below mediocre
*  or worse QB paths, saints, Carolina, Tennessee, Vegas twice, Denver twice, Cleveland, Pittsburgh,
*  maybe Tampa Bay. That's like most of their schedule. They don't have to play. They play
*  my homes twice. You're right. I mean, their extra games are Arizona, New England, and Tennessee.
*  That's kind of all you need. Yeah. I just wish that the second easiest schedule. I just wish their
*  roster was a little more impressive. They were also minus two Pythagorean last year,
*  which a stat I barely understand, or it tells you they were five and 12, but they should have
*  gone seven and 10. Yeah. I can't say it Pythagorean. Yeah. Las Vegas over six and a half
*  minus one 42 on that. A lot of juice 10 to one to win the division.
*  I am violently under on this. Wow. And I did explore the, some of the worst record 14 to one
*  under four and a half wins plus three 40. They have a bottom three coach QB combo in the league
*  and the, the history of the interim coach taking over from a disaster coach and doing okay. And
*  then people like, you should give them the job and like, yeah, give them the job. And then he's
*  terrible. That happens most of the time. The John Gruden drafts, they're still recovering from how
*  bad those drafts were. And they have three of the best coaches in the NFL are all in their division
*  and their quarterback situation is yikes. So basically they have a good pass rush and they
*  have good tight ends and that's it. The Vontae Adams will be unhappy. It's weird. They, it seems
*  like there's some buzz building for them as getting a little sleepy and I couldn't see it less. I don't
*  understand it. I like them. You like them. What do you like? Tell me what you like. I like them.
*  Then Tony appears, led them to eight and nine. They're not afraid of anybody. They punched the
*  chiefs in the mouth. You could say I was lucky. I think they get seven wins. I have them as a
*  playoff team. I do. I think their offensive line is good. I think they're going to, they could have
*  a great tight end system here with mayor and Brock. Do they have a quarterback that I don't
*  know about? No, you don't need a quarterback. Cause I checked in their quarterbacks the last
*  time I looked with Gardner, Minshew and Aiden O'Connell. He wasn't that bad. He wasn't that bad.
*  Aiden O'Connell wasn't that bad compared to who? You beat the chiefs. Like the CFL quarterbacks.
*  They have 10 home games. If you count the two in LA, like I think they're, they're in good shape.
*  They got that Christian Wilkins, who you like from Miami. I do like him. Right. Crosby, Tyree,
*  Wilson, Coons. They're going to have a good pass rush for sure. They're like a gutty team. They
*  added that Jack Jones from the Patriots. So I don't know. Jack Jones from the Patriots. He got
*  arrested. I think it's, is he arrested? Well, not anymore. Oh, all right. They have touch stretch,
*  tough stretches, but you know, Jacksonville and New Orleans. But here's the problem in the end.
*  Your best quality on your team is the pass rush, but you have an offense that's not probably going
*  to be able to score that much. Yeah. And you're going to be behind in a lot of games, which kind
*  of negates the point of having a pass rush. Right. Like I don't understand that part. I would want
*  a pass rush if I had like Patrick Mahomes or Lamar Jackson, not having Aidan O'Connell and Gardner
*  Mitschew. And I think that was probably one of the biggest Mitschew fans, but you know, the,
*  the Colts, the receivers they had and the coach they had Stike and like, that's as good as we're
*  ever going to do with them. And they didn't make the playoffs with, in a better situation. Well,
*  have two great pass catching tight ends and maybe that'll help. I think that's what Michael Maers
*  a great pass catching. I didn't get that memo. I want this to be my secret, but I think I have
*  to pick one of these teams to, you know, kind of can't believe it or wherever you have the Raiders
*  in to make the playoffs. That's it. That's my surprise. Okay. So at Chargers at Baltimore,
*  week one, week two, I think they have to win one of those two for you to be alive for that. Yeah.
*  After that home Carolina, home Cleveland. And then who knows front seven. Pretty tough. Defense is
*  good. Week six to 11 is kind of tough, but I like the way they're built. They play the AFC
*  North and the NFC South this year. I don't see it, Sal. All right. Look, I'm going to be wrong about
*  at least 80% of these. So we disagreed about as much as I can remember for a conference. Yeah.
*  So my surprise, we're not done yet. All right. We have Denver. Oh yeah. We have Denver.
*  Forgot about Denver. Sorry. Denver. Denver is over five and a half. You have a total
*  minus one 20 juice on that playoffs plus five 90. If you want to go every year, there's a
*  five to one and up playoff team that actually makes it that one down. That was eight to one.
*  Yeah. There's been some, yeah, there's some buzz with this team as like, wait, why is that over
*  under so low? And hey, that there's been some good bone Nick stuff. Sean Payton year two.
*  I'm going over and I also really like eight plus wins at plus three 10. I thought was a,
*  was a fun bet, but, um, offensive line is good. Bo Nicks has checked all the boxes. Apparently
*  I think they can be able to run the ball. The wide receivers are so deep. They're trying to
*  trade Tim Patrick, which I didn't understand. And I think they caught them. I don't even know.
*  The case against it is they lost those Russell Wilson trade picks and they waved him and took
*  a huge cap space hit. But, um, I don't know the fact that they went eight and nine last year was
*  like, I thought one of the achievements of the 2023 season, right? How did they go eight and nine? I
*  would have thought they went like three and 14. Right. Well, they had one of the, and they would
*  have gone nine and eight if we didn't beat them at the game. Kyle and I watched that cost us the
*  first pick of the draft. You shouldn't have done that. Yeah. But we love Drake, but, uh, but yeah,
*  they were a Patriots comeback from having a above 500 record last year. So I don't know. I,
*  five and a half wins seems insult. I think their defense is going to be bad. I think their defense
*  is insulting. They should be bottom five pressure D. They lost Justin Simmons. The all pro went to
*  Atlanta, you know, the 30th ranked last year. They use most of their draft picks on offensive
*  skill players, except for Ellis. They'll give up five yards per carry. I just don't see that
*  getting better. Yeah. You like Courtney Sutton and these guys had like nine quarterbacks,
*  like after a while, it's kind of your fault. They've had no wins at the Raiders or chiefs
*  since 2015. I didn't like that. They end with charges, Bengals, chiefs. It's, um, you know,
*  they're on the road three out of first four to start. I'm a look, I love Bo Nicks. I've seen
*  them live, but I think this is, um, this is one of my candidates for worst record. I got Denver
*  under. I test drove them as a playoff team and I couldn't get there, but I just don't think
*  Shane Sean Payton is there's certain coaches that I just don't see having them having shitty teams.
*  Seven, six, whatever. I mean, your Patriots didn't do so hot last year. They didn't. That
*  coach was good. Our coach was old and now he's died eyebrows. Um, what do you got for your prop?
*  Well, the chiefs have for the division eight in a row. They know how to win the
*  close important games, but, uh, Crosby 15 or more sacks plus two 50. He's right there. He had 12
*  and a half last year, 14, 14 half last year, 12 and a half and 22. He's got some help with Wilkins
*  opening up the middle Malcolm Coons on the other side at eight sacks. So he's to be considered not
*  as many double triple teams. So that's my prop. I kind of like that. My prop, uh, is a complete
*  zag against you and everyone else who pleads in Vegas. I like the under five and a half wins,
*  which is now plus one 98 for the Raiders. Yeah. Five and 12 or worse. Two to one ounce. All right.
*  You know what I like betting against bad quarterbacks. It was five and five. Aiden
*  O'Connell. There's worse. Come on. There's a person. I picked him up with my fantasy team.
*  Aiden O'Connell is not a starting quarterback. He's not. That's your fault. We have to have two
*  quarterbacks in that dumb league. That was a dumb role. All right. Any final thoughts before
*  we move to the NFC? No, just, uh, so you have Buffalo, Buffalo winning the conference. Yeah.
*  Close to 10 to one. I think that's a recap. You'd like Buffalo to win the conference and Vegas is a
*  playoff Vegas makes the playoffs. You're too wild. This one's that's it. And mine are Pittsburgh
*  being the second AFC team, Allen and burrow not to be in the playoffs. And so no Buffalo in the
*  playoffs. You're saying I don't think I have Buffalo in the play. Oh, wow. Hold on. Let me,
*  let me check to make sure that's true. Yeah. I have just one team from the AFC. I have Casey,
*  Houston, the jets, Baltimore, Jacksonville, Pittsburgh, and the Chargers as my seven
*  playoff teams. Yeah. But I might be wrong. It's jets or bills in a coin flip. So I think we agreed
*  on probably four of the 16 or five. That's the least we've agreed on, but those are going to win.
*  I don't have a good winning percentage. Somebody's going to be unhappy. Yeah. All right. We're going
*  to take this to a part two later in the week. Cause it's out. Great to see you as always.
