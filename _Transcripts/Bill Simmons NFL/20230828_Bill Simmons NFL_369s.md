# Why the Steelers and the Packers are Playoff Teams This Year | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [August 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bi4It2fyX7Q)
*  Pittsburgh plus 128. So as you said, the lions are in the super bowl.
*  I don't know if people realize that they're already on the program and stuff because they finished the year so strong last year.
*  Such a strong ending to the year, right? Oh, of course, you're gonna carry over.
*  Pittsburgh was seven and two in their last nine and almost beat Baltimore and Pickett.
*  I thought was legitimately solid and now looks like he's even taking a step up. They had a good draft.
*  They had Watt missing for three months last year.
*  Warren might be better than Najee Harris. I guess we're going to find out. They got Pickens in year two.
*  And I'm just looking at them going, I think that team can win the division.
*  Yeah, and they had a great offseason. I mean, Patrick, Tomlin, well from Minnesota, you know, Tomlin's a great coach.
*  Look, that's the biggest.
*  You know, when you get that media train behind it like Detroit.
*  So they both play. This is what I keep telling people.
*  They both played Carolina in consecutive weeks.
*  Pittsburgh goes into Carolina and kicks the living shit out of Carolina.
*  I mean, Carolina can't do anything against them. They win the score.
*  I think they won by two touchdowns or eight points, but the game was never that close.
*  They kicked Carolina's ass.
*  The next week, Detroit goes down there and Carolina kicks Detroit's ass.
*  Like, like this.
*  The Pittsburgh's a really good team. If they would be in the NFC North,
*  they would be the favorite to win the North without a question of a doubt.
*  I mean, they're really well coached.
*  The quarterback didn't make mistakes the second half of the season.
*  Remember that Baltimore game that they turned the ball over three times.
*  My man, MVP Mitch, came off the bench in a relief
*  and threw two red zone touch interceptions.
*  He couldn't wait to help that happen.
*  So that that killed them there.
*  I think they only turned the ball over five times in that nine games
*  in that nine game stretch.
*  And three of them came in that game.
*  So, yeah, I'm with you on Pittsburgh.
*  I really am. I think Pittsburgh.
*  They might have a chance to have a top five defense, right?
*  Top seven. They'll be somewhere in the if everyone's healthy.
*  I think it'll be in the top.
*  When I was in Cleveland, Kevin,
*  we played in 1989, we played in the Astrodome.
*  And it was we were either going to be the number two seed in the AFC
*  or we were not going to make the playoffs if we beat the oilers.
*  And they were great. They had Warren Moon.
*  They had this great team. I wrote about him in the book.
*  It was incredible.
*  Kevin Mack scores on with 47 seconds left to go in the game.
*  And we win the game. We get the number two seed.
*  That's the last time 1989.
*  That's the last time the Browns finished ahead of the Steelers
*  in the North Central, whatever you want to call it.
*  Think about that. That's the last time it happened.
*  It's the last time.
*  And so like they're just physically, mentally tougher
*  than a lot of these teams.
*  Well, you must have loved the time one quote this week.
*  Oh, yeah. That was Parcell's quote.
*  He just he just put it around in a different sentence.
*  So for the people listening, he what was it?
*  You know the quote. What is it exactly?
*  I've never known a boxer that can win a fight if he don't spar.
*  That was his theory and preseason.
*  Yeah, I'm going to play my guys some of the preseason games.
*  We got to have some put some sparring in.
*  All right. The kind of can't believe it. Teams Green Bay plus one thirty eight.
*  And I feel like I'm taking crazy pills with them.
*  I think they're going to be good.
*  I I'm kind of in on the Packers and especially in that division.
*  And if you just give me the Lions over here and the Packers over here
*  and you're saying with the Packers, well, they don't have Aaron Rodgers anymore.
*  OK, he wasn't he didn't play well last year.
*  Yeah, they didn't really have Aaron Rodgers last year because he wasn't good.
*  Love's been waiting for this for a couple of years.
*  They have a lot of assets on both sides of the ball.
*  It's a team that succeeded and been in playoff games.
*  They have a lot of first round picks.
*  I don't know. I just I could see them going 10 and seven of the plus one thirty
*  one thirty eight, nine and eight might make the playoffs in the NFC.
*  That seems logical.
*  I'm with you. They gave up thirty four points to Detroit in two games last year.
*  And if Rogers would have played half decent in either game, it gets
*  really turn the ball over the red zone. Right.
*  And that killed them.
*  I mean, their defense the last half of the season,
*  I think gave up an average of 17 points a game.
*  They were really good at the end of the year.
*  They were playing good defense. They were healthy on defense.
*  The front sevens really good. They could rush the passer.
*  I mean, they're good. And they're they're young.
*  I mean, other than Preston Smith and Devante and Devante
*  Campbell, Devante Campbell, they're a young defense.
*  They can run around.
*  Alexander can cover anybody in the league.
*  Their offensive line.
*  If Bakari's back, he's good at left tackle.
*  I mean, and they got two young tight ends now that'll be.
*  But these young receivers, Dobs and Watson are really good.
*  I'm with you. All all love has to be is good.
*  You know, it's funny. Packer fans.
*  He's like, just just be like a B minus and we're good.
*  Be a decent point guard.
*  That's all you can be. Speedy Klaxon, a point guard.
*  That's all you got to do. Just be a decent point guard. Right.
*  Of course, we drafted him in the first. Anyway, anyway, anyway, we'll go.
*  Be Gabe Vincent. Just be Gabe Vincent.
*  Bring the ball up in three. Exactly.
*  You know, so like think about this, Bill.
*  It's been it's been since Don Majkowski took a snap
*  and they went from the Kowski to Favre.
*  They've had like eleven thousand days of having Favre and Rogers,
*  and they've only won two.
*  This Packer fan base has been spoiled.
*  Like, you don't need to always have the best quarterback in the league.
*  Like they have had that right.
*  And they're just going to have to find a way to win.
*  Now, the problem is, I worry about Lafour.
*  Is he going to do something that I don't like?
*  And that's what I worry about.
*  But to me, watching him this summer, I think he's running the offense
*  that best suits love their schedule.
*  They play the AFC West.
*  So that gives them Vegas and Denver and then NFC South, which
*  potentially could be favored in every game.
*  Hard games for them this year at Atlanta, at Denver, at Pittsburgh, at Detroit,
*  home Kansas City, at the Giants, at Minnesota.
*  That's really it.
*  So it's sitting there for them.
*  And if they hit their draft, which is always the hardest thing
*  to figure out with this stuff.
*  But people seem like their draft.
*  I'm with you. I really like Watson.
