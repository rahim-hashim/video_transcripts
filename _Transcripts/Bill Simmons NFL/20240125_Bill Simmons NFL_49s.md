# Recruiting Bill Belichick to The Ringer #shorts #billsimmons #billbelichick #nfl #atlantafalcons
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [January 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWBZgNuAoi0)
*  So Bill Belichick did not get hired by the Atlanta Falcons, which is hilarious.
*  They made him do two interviews. He's won six Super Bowls. He's a football genius.
*  He stole the Super Bowl from Seattle. Go watch that tape Atlanta.
*  I guess that didn't come up in your two interviews you jackasses.
*  This is why you're the Atlanta Falcons.
*  Anyway, they didn't hire him.
*  Bill Belichick, come to the ringer. I got a spot for you.
*  I got Tuesdays, Thursdays. Come on like Doc Rivers did. Come on for an hour.
*  We'll talk football during the season.
*  If you want, you can guess the lines with me and Sal.
*  You can wear whatever you want.
*  You could do it from where you did the draft that year in your kitchen in Nantucket.
*  I think you're great in media. Who am I bidding against?
*  I'll get the Swedes to cut a check.
*  You won six Super Bowls and now you can come to the ringer for one year
*  before you're coaching the Dallas Cowboys a year from now.
*  Let's join forces. You know how to get in touch with me.
