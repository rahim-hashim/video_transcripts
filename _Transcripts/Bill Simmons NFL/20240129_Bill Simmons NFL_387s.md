# Is Mahomes the Greatest Active Athlete? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [January 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRuavcUjBFY)
*  So what is what's can we count down just to look ahead because it feels like we're gonna take a little break here for a
*  Couple days everybody takes a breath from football. Yeah, and then it kind of circles back
*  What is the biggest storyline to you from this game?
*  The biggest one
*  Huh Kyle shenan's got to get it done, right
*  It's I think for me. It's my home's getting three rings
*  Yeah, I think he moves to another stratosphere if he pulls this off with this team
*  Because I don't think what's the next stratosphere because I've had this conversation. He's still years away from Brady
*  So in your mind he passes Montana for sure
*  Well, I think it cements he's in that final group when we mentioned the greatest quarterbacks ever, but I even think like he's there
*  Yeah, well, I think it like he's young. He's only you know, his first full season was 2018
*  But now I was thinking
*  Cross-sport stratosphere becomes kind of interesting at that point
*  The hell's I mean well you comparing them to basketball players baseball players soccer tennis
*  You're talking about is this our greatest living athlete?
*  I think becomes in play at that point because to do this in football in a 32 team league that's designed for
*  Nobody to be good for more than three four years as a team and then it dips down again
*  To just be this good over and over again
*  I think I think that's a harder feat than and he's playing the hardest position of any of any sport
*  So to do that I think puts him in another group and now it's like if we're arguing about him versus Yoke Hitch
*  And Pete like he wins against anybody you want to mention he wins again
*  You're baiting me to bring up Brady and say he's you know, we can't play anymore. I'm talking about right now. Okay. All right
*  Yeah, I'm talking about people
*  Current stars in different sports
*  He's he becomes he he's holding the championship belt
*  I kind of think he's there you think he's at number one with that you think he's over LeBron. So so Mahomes
*  LeBron's hasn't won a title since
*  2020 he's won one title in the last
*  Eight years. He's 39 years old
*  Right, so it's Yoke Hitch and that then stop in that f1 guy. You look which just lost a sinner Harry's guy
*  That's right in the Australian Harry Harry $75 on he's very excited
*  Yeah, there's no golfer who I think has ascended above all the other golfers, right?
*  This is good. I don't think there's a soccer star. There's no boxer. So Rudy is that can you think of anyone so Rudy?
*  Mahomes has this right if he wins this
*  There's nobody in soccer. No
*  Is there anyone in any sport that you would have?
*  Wouldn't be baseball because it's for stopping for stopping is you know, yeah
*  We're going F1. Okay fun, but yeah
*  Wow that f1. Yeah, we could just have a whole podcast some verse stopping versus Mahomes
*  magic I
*  Am NOT prepared to participate in that podcast
*  Anyway, he's the goat
*  chestnut
*  You know who's kind of
*  In the running unfortunately, it's a scripted sport with predetermined results, but Roman Reigns is pretty unbelievable last few years
*  He's had the title forever. You're right. He doesn't let up. He doesn't let up the 2020s belong to Roman Reigns and Pat
*  Mahomes
*  Right and then so you would say the Uso brothers are sort of like when the referees help Mahomes a little bit
*  You lose triple H is like Sean Smith today
*  So I have my homes going for three rings is the number one storyline. You're still sticking with Shanahan
*  Yeah, I think that's number one. I mean my homes the Taylor Swift stuff is gonna
*  Infiltrate that I have that second that I have actually I wrote down mr. Relevant first Taylor Swift
*  Right because I think the mr. Relevant thing is an unbelievable story and purdy is almost as good of a story as anything else
*  Because you could argue. Yeah, they might have won the title last year if he didn't get hurt
*  Now they're in the in the Super Bowl again the fact that he was the last pick of the draft, which I know has been
*  Discussed ad nauseam, but it really is incredible. This guy was the last pick of the draft. Like what are the odds?
*  I really like them. I like watching them
*  There's been a couple times this year where we counted him out or lay out here
*  We go this is the clock is struck midnight and then he seems to rally back
*  And I thought he made really good throws today once he kind of settled down I thought he was good
*  What do you think about Andy Reid being the best coach of any had that in there?
*  Yeah, I mean that's he does he go to the top two or three in your mind
*  I had I had that as my fourth one. I have him as the active coach goat
*  Yeah, cuz Belichick can't get a job. Mm-hmm. I
*  Can't believe listen, I actually really like Raheem Morris
*  I thought that was like one of the best available coaches, right?
*  But it's hard for me to believe Belichick wanted to coach the Falcons and they were like cool. Thanks
*  Anyway, cuz I thought he was really good this year with a team that he had screwed up with the roster selections
*  But I wanted a person. I think you are playing some kind of practical joke on everybody
*  I think you and your patriot fan friends get together and like we could foist Belichick on someone
*  He was three and fourteen as a 71 year old 13. Oh four and 13 and he wants to run the organization wherever he goes
*  Why well that let's make I'm out on that McDermott loses. Oh, the bills have to sign them
*  Oh the Cowboys have to sign him. Why didn't Atlanta Atlanta might be the big winner
*  They avoided Lamar Jackson and Belichick good job for you
*  Joe Gibbs Joe Gibbs is he he has a yes some hardware. Yes some trophies. He's only a year
*  You're telling me you'd rather have Mike McCarthy the bill Belichick. Yeah at this point why not what why was see the bell checks washed?
*  It's over
*  What he has to prove himself again? He does. I'm sorry
*  I just you can't let four or five years go before you win and not take a year off or something
*  All right, you know, it's true. I know
*  You
