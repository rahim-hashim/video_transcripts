# Super Bowl LIX Props With Cousin Sal | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI)
*  Sal, you hate this. It's Super Bowl week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=0.0s)]
*  It's supposed to be all NFL. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2.36s)]
*  And then the NBA holes come flying in with the most shocking trade in NBA history. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=4.08s)]
*  And now you got to like take a side, take a seat on the side. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=8.68s)]
*  I know a seat on the side. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=12.96s)]
*  Disgusting, disgusting that this is the most important sports podcast you're going [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=15.48s)]
*  to do all year. And how many minutes of NBA wholeness did you air before me? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=19.92s)]
*  I know it's a double pod this weekend. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=26.2s)]
*  Yeah, but you put the Luka stuff before me, didn't you? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=27.04s)]
*  Yeah, you did. You're like the second guest. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=29.64s)]
*  Son of a bitch. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  I know. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=32.96s)]
*  We're still going. We're still doing our thing. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=33.36s)]
*  It's just, you know, look, congratulations. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=35.68s)]
*  Now listen, your league is back. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=37.6s)]
*  You could go back to 17 minute quarters and 100 games in the regular season. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  That's good. We kept 12 minute quarters. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=44.0s)]
*  We're good. Yeah, that's what happened. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=45.6s)]
*  Silver's like, hey, man, we got to we're thinking of changing the size of the court [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  and and how much time is in each quarter. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  Can we just do something to make Boston, New York and L.A. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=53.88s)]
*  great over the next three years? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=56.44s)]
*  Come on, Dallas. Can you step up here? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. What if we put Luka and LeBron on the same team? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  What do you want to complete about the ratings again? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  The good news is, though, I will say your trade machine and trade thoughts, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=65.44s)]
*  which I thought a lot of times were nonsense, like when week seven, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=69.04s)]
*  when we had to do 10 minutes on the honest to the Nets. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=71.84s)]
*  And I was like, OK, good. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=74.56s)]
*  But now people should listen to you because nothing is too ludicrous. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=75.52s)]
*  There's not one trade that could be too crazy to to pass muster here. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=80.16s)]
*  It really is true. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=85.56s)]
*  Like now, at this point, the only person [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  I would refuse to believe got traded is Wemby. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think everyone else in the league, you could talk me into a trade [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=92.28s)]
*  in a ridiculous scenario involving any player. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  Super Bowl Chiefs Eagles, we've had a week to either think about or not think about it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=99.56s)]
*  There are a ton of props. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  Fando has amazing pages and pages of great stuff, great links. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=105.2s)]
*  We're going to have Ringer specials on there later. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=109.92s)]
*  Ringer Sunday pregame is going to have some stuff like we're we're good. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=111.84s)]
*  Do you have a feel for the Super Bowl yet and has it affected your Super Bowl props? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=117.28s)]
*  The things that you think will happen in the game or you're steering that way already? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=121.4s)]
*  Yes, I think so. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=125.0s)]
*  I think you and I will give our official picks [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=126.68s)]
*  who's going to win towards the end of the week. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=129.04s)]
*  I did notice that I don't need two weeks. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  I don't let's get to the part where I'm depressed already. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=133.72s)]
*  Like I don't have to be depressed about being depressed. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=136.68s)]
*  Right. So I don't like this extra week in between. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=140.16s)]
*  It makes me analysis leads to paralysis. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=143.2s)]
*  There's like a lot of ways to determine how old we are. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=145.64s)]
*  Like, oh, Babe Ruth won the home run title closer to when we were born than today. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=147.88s)]
*  You know, and that sucks. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=153.0s)]
*  And you and I'll send something. Oh, yeah. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  Is that true? Three's company premiered 48 years ago. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=156.67999999999998s)]
*  It all sucks. But I was thinking today, I was like. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=159.6s)]
*  We at most have 30 more Super Bowls left if we're lucky. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=163.76s)]
*  Like, I take care of myself. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=167.6s)]
*  You don't you know, you're going to start doing cocaine. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  I'm not. That's a problem. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=171.39999999999998s)]
*  But there's going to be a thousand more Super Bowls and we're only going to see 30. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=173.44s)]
*  That's disgusting to me. That really made me feel sick. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=177.76s)]
*  So join in on that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=180.44s)]
*  I think about that all the time. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=183.0s)]
*  How when I'm finally dead, how mad I'm going to be. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=184.68s)]
*  Not just that I'm dead, but I'm not going to know what's going to happen for the next [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=187.48s)]
*  25 Super Bowls, that be a comment. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  I am my lean is close game. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=196.56s)]
*  I have two liens so far, and I'm still debating where to go with the game [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=199.68s)]
*  and probably will decide on Tuesday. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=203.64000000000001s)]
*  But it feels like the line is off. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=206.4s)]
*  And it feels like it's going to be a close game. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  Those are my two liens. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=211.72s)]
*  I actually think the Eagles should be favored the more I stare at this. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=212.72s)]
*  Yeah. And I don't know what the Mahomes tax is at this point, but it feels like it's a field goal. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=215.84s)]
*  Right. At least can you can you say both those things? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=221.0s)]
*  Like, I know most people like Rahim has a model and most people have models might even have the game. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=224.32s)]
*  Might even have the Eagles by three at this point. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=228.92s)]
*  And so but can you also say, but I think it's going to be a close game [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=232.0s)]
*  because if you're going to lean model and Eagles and you think it's going to be a close game, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=235.88s)]
*  how dare you go against Mahomes and a right then the chief should win [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=240.84s)]
*  the fourth game of a close game. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=243.88s)]
*  I guess more like I don't think it's going to be a blowout. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=245.64s)]
*  Like, I don't think either of these teams is blowing out the other team. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=247.76s)]
*  Could one of them win by 10 points? 12. Sure. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=250.72s)]
*  But it feels like it's going to be a relatively close game. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=254.76s)]
*  No blowout. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=256.92s)]
*  And I just think the Eagles should be favored by like two and a half on a neutral field. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=258.76000000000005s)]
*  They have made me more good players all over the place. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=263.96000000000004s)]
*  They have an easier way to win than the chiefs do. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=266.76000000000005s)]
*  And you go back and you look at as great as the chiefs were, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=270.48s)]
*  the fact that they were 17 and two thrown week 18. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=273.56s)]
*  They're basically 17 and one to throw week 18. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=276.48s)]
*  But it just was harder for them week to week [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=279.32000000000005s)]
*  than when you watch this Eagles team just seems to be really cruel. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=284.44s)]
*  I mean, the Eagles have won 15 of the last 16. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=287.84s)]
*  Yeah. So you're taking the Eagles. That's OK. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=292.92s)]
*  I'm leaning toward the Eagles and I'm just afraid to go against Mahomes, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=295.68s)]
*  which is why the line is where the line is. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  That's why it's the whole point of this line is nobody wants to bet against the chiefs. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=300.96s)]
*  I wouldn't look into the line to it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=304.68s)]
*  By the way, I'm going to pretend to get text from NFL GMs during this pod. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=306.12s)]
*  I felt that was very effective with Rossello last night with the NBA guy. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=309.2s)]
*  It's a great wrinkle for him. Yeah. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=312.76s)]
*  But I am the Memphis GM. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=314.52s)]
*  But I would disregard the line because I do have facts here. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=317.76s)]
*  In the first 58 Super Bowls, only seven times as a favorite one and not covered. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=321.44s)]
*  It happened with the Rams Bengals most recently. Right. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=325.8s)]
*  It happened twice in the last 17 years. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=328.36s)]
*  So take Casey minus one and a half or take Philly Moneyline. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=330.48s)]
*  You'll probably be OK. Right. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=334.36s)]
*  That's a playoff manifesto staple, especially at this time. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=336.28s)]
*  You're just betting who you think is going to win. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=339.28s)]
*  Don't worry about the line. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=341.12s)]
*  Yeah. So that's what I'll say about that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=342.32s)]
*  But I think you're right. It might be off. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=344.36s)]
*  But I also think it doesn't matter because of that fact. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=345.84s)]
*  I just what matters for teasers and stuff. Yeah. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=348.28s)]
*  So you can get Philly above seven. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=351.2s)]
*  Pretty tasty. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=353.88s)]
*  All right. So every year and we've been doing this forever. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=355.44s)]
*  I actually researched this. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=359.03999999999996s)]
*  We were the first people, the first two people ever to like Super Bowl props. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=360.47999999999996s)]
*  You know, you researched it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=365.55999999999995s)]
*  The media. Yeah. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=366.64s)]
*  We were the first ones. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=367.67999999999995s)]
*  I don't think a lot of people. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=368.79999999999995s)]
*  Nobody ever talked about Super Bowl props. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=370.23999999999995s)]
*  That's true. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=372.76s)]
*  We felt like we were really going on a limb. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=373.52s)]
*  We did a pod and like maybe the 2007 Super Bowl and we floated some props [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=375.76s)]
*  and everybody in the world was like, what are these? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=380.32s)]
*  What are these guys talking about? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=382.68s)]
*  No, all these years later, it's a cottage industry. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=383.96s)]
*  I don't think we get the credit. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=386.32s)]
*  There had never been a Super Bowl prop before we did a pocket. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=387.48s)]
*  I love it. We willed it as far as we know. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=389.92s)]
*  They right. They actually didn't even exist. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=392.76s)]
*  Like first touchdown. What? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=394.96s)]
*  What are these guys talking about? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=396.4s)]
*  We started everything. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=397.59999999999997s)]
*  You couldn't find it. You couldn't even bet it. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=398.8s)]
*  So eventually we forced the books to actually come up with these. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=400.44s)]
*  That's actually not true, obviously. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=403.64s)]
*  And the first time we watched the Super Bowl together [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=405.4s)]
*  when it was the first day, Jimmy Kimmel was doing a show [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=408.76s)]
*  and we were in charge of monitoring the Tampa Bay Oakland game. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=411.67999999999995s)]
*  Right. And coming up with jokes. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=415.47999999999996s)]
*  And we're in a van and you had this whole printout sheet of Super Bowl props. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=416.88s)]
*  That was like 58 pages. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=421.96s)]
*  And we're just going through and there would be silence. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=424.32s)]
*  Like, hey, Simmons, what about Rich Gannon over under completions? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=426.32s)]
*  And that was just the whole ride. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=431.03999999999996s)]
*  So we've loved this forever. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=432.88s)]
*  That was a great find when you could. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=434.32s)]
*  You had a sort of the Internet wasn't what it is now. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=436.28s)]
*  And if you could find a PDF where you could print all the props, right. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=438.59999999999997s)]
*  And it would send your printer into a tizzy, you know, it'd be like 25 pages. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=441.76s)]
*  Yeah, because it would be all the HTML would be off. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=445.88s)]
*  It would be like the margins would be too small. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=448.36s)]
*  You'd have like these little crazy, beautiful mind notes on each page. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=451.76s)]
*  Now we just go to Fandel and there's all these hyperlinks. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=455.12s)]
*  Come along. If we separate it, it's great. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=457.64s)]
*  Let's can we start with MVP? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=460.71999999999997s)]
*  Because there's a couple of Mahomes is plus 110, Barclays plus 280, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=463.03999999999996s)]
*  Hertz is plus 370. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=466.35999999999996s)]
*  And the most interesting one was the field versus Mahomes is minus 150. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=468.15999999999997s)]
*  And we always look at this and we always like it. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=472.64s)]
*  And but if you think if you think Casey is not going to win, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=474.59999999999997s)]
*  this feels like a fun MVP back because you basically get everybody else. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=478.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=482.79999999999995s)]
*  You could parlay it with other stuff. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=483.35999999999996s)]
*  I didn't look at it that way. That is good. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=485.55999999999995s)]
*  And I was thinking, though, so we have to get in their heads, right? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=487.23999999999995s)]
*  Is there Mahomes fatigue if the Chiefs win for MVP? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=490.52s)]
*  Like he didn't have a great game against Philly. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=493.76s)]
*  Now against Philly. No, the last game. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=497.08s)]
*  So he stayed under 200 yards, but had three touchdowns and they had to give it to him. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=498.56s)]
*  Right. So I'm trying to write a script for how Mahomes doesn't get MVP. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=503.2s)]
*  If the Chiefs win, is it Kelsey announces Thursday [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=508.0s)]
*  that he's going to retire after this game and he gets to save your worthy like eight for 120. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=511.36s)]
*  There's that like Julian Edelman type of game that's sitting there. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=517.36s)]
*  There's like the big Kelsey game. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=521.2800000000001s)]
*  I don't know if any the way they use their running backs. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=523.0s)]
*  I don't see how either running back would be in it. Right. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=525.4000000000001s)]
*  So you're looking at a crazy worthy game, a crazy Kelsey game or Mahomes. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=528.0400000000001s)]
*  If Casey wins, the funny thing is plus 110 is nice. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=533.0s)]
*  You talk about how like long [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=535.9200000000001s)]
*  come such a far away, however you say that we you could live bet the MVP. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=538.88s)]
*  Right. And remember, like Cadarius Tony was like a punchline. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=544.1600000000001s)]
*  Now he had like a big game, had a big punt return and a touchdown like, oh, man. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=546.92s)]
*  But Mahomes was still favored. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=551.4s)]
*  I remember looking at that like, you know, so that's something to look at that. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=553.0s)]
*  I think choosing between Barkley and Hertz is really tough if you take in the Eagles. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=556.1999999999999s)]
*  I might just rather take the Eagles. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=560.5999999999999s)]
*  I did look at defensive MVP is plus 1500. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=562.8399999999999s)]
*  Once the game gets to the 40s, you're kind of cooked. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=566.8s)]
*  But nine out of 57 defensive players have won. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=569.1999999999999s)]
*  And so that's like one out of six or one out of seven. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=573.04s)]
*  And you're getting 15 to one. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=575.52s)]
*  It's not bad. The problem with [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=576.76s)]
*  the problem with taking the field versus Mahomes, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=580.4s)]
*  I guess you get everyone on the chiefs to with that minus one. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=583.04s)]
*  So it's a parlay of the eagle side, which you could just bet straight up for plus [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=587.0s)]
*  110, but then you're covered on every other non Mahomes thing. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=591.56s)]
*  But I think the best value is Barkley. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=595.08s)]
*  A plus 280, because I think if they win, I think he's going to be the best [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=599.16s)]
*  player in the game would be my my assumption. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=602.16s)]
*  Like he gashes them a couple of times. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=604.64s)]
*  He's been the best part of the playoffs. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=606.56s)]
*  It's a narrative that makes sense to me. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=608.16s)]
*  And I thought the odds were pretty good. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=610.1999999999999s)]
*  What would have what would the Hertz game have to be for MVP? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=612.3199999999999s)]
*  So he's throwing two touchdowns, probably one deep one. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=615.64s)]
*  It's probably 20 for 27 for 255. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=619.04s)]
*  He probably has one long run of like a 40 yard run. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=623.52s)]
*  Maybe it's like seven for 52 running. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=626.24s)]
*  And it's just it's something like that. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=630.0799999999999s)]
*  Right. I think you're right. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=632.24s)]
*  But plus it's Barkley's birthday, you know, on the Super Bowl. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=633.84s)]
*  So I don't know how much that factors in. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=636.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=638.88s)]
*  Turns 28. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=639.2800000000001s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=640.96s)]
*  And plus if it's plus 280 and he turns 28, am I wrong to say he's 28? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=641.88s)]
*  That's a that's pretty good numbers. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=646.0400000000001s)]
*  But I think you're right. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=647.72s)]
*  I don't know if Hertz getting the touchdowns on the tush push. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=648.6s)]
*  If he gets like three of those and puts up good yards, if that's going [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=651.24s)]
*  to put them over the top, but it's it's been Barkley's year. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=654.48s)]
*  I think that's that's probably the case for Barkley. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=657.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=660.5600000000001s)]
*  Plus 280 is still good if it's close to three. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=660.88s)]
*  The Barkley bets that jumped out. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=663.32s)]
*  So I've never monitored this, but there was a 25 plus rushing yards each [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=665.9200000000001s)]
*  quarter for plus seven 50 that I've never bet on and I have no idea if [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=669.52s)]
*  that's a good bet or not. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=674.24s)]
*  It seems terrible. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=675.08s)]
*  Two touchdowns is plus 280. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=676.48s)]
*  So you'd have to, you'd probably have to break one of those and then [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=679.48s)]
*  maybe get one around five or six. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=682.6800000000001s)]
*  That the odds were pretty good. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=684.48s)]
*  There was one where him and Kareem hunt 200 plus rush yards is three to one. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=685.88s)]
*  So you figured he, if he got over like 130, 140, if he thought hunt was [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=690.76s)]
*  going to be in the 50s, sixties, that could get there three to one's nice. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=695.1999999999999s)]
*  But I think the one I liked the most is 169 plus rushing yards, which [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=698.7199999999999s)]
*  would be a new record is five to one. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=706.64s)]
*  So you just bet on that. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=711.4399999999999s)]
*  And basically the bet is I bet that Saquon Barkley will break the record [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=712.5999999999999s)]
*  169 boom, five to one. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=717.56s)]
*  It's pretty good. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=720.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=720.92s)]
*  I was looking at, you said Barkley two plus touchdowns is plus two 70. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=721.3599999999999s)]
*  So that's the same 280 plus two 80. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=725.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=727.76s)]
*  So that's the same odds as his MVP. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=728.3199999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=730.3599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=731.3599999999999s)]
*  So you just take that instead. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=732.16s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=733.4399999999999s)]
*  I think I might want to take that instead. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=734.28s)]
*  I don't think there's a game where you like that one the most. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=736.24s)]
*  Do you have any other Barclay bets? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=739.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=740.24s)]
*  Well, it's funny. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=740.56s)]
*  Um, you said that actually this one was just texted me from less need of the [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=741.24s)]
*  Rams, uh, GM, he said, um, Kelsey. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=744.9599999999999s)]
*  Jel Kelsey, 25 or more receiving yards in each half is, uh, is a good number there. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=749.08s)]
*  So that, that happened already this year. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=756.08s)]
*  And if that, what's the odds on that? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=758.2800000000001s)]
*  So it's 307 yards over the last three Superbowls. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=760.6s)]
*  So I kind of like that and I'd already hit against the Texans this year. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=763.32s)]
*  So, okay. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=767.32s)]
*  Um, yeah. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=768.64s)]
*  So I had the Barkley one, the hurt stuff. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=770.12s)]
*  There's an anytime TD for him for minus one 15. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=775.12s)]
*  And that's just one tush push, right? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=779.8000000000001s)]
*  If it's first and go from the two third and go from the one. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=782.36s)]
*  I, I gotta say, I was surprised that was the line. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=787.6s)]
*  I thought that was going to be like minus one 40. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=790.76s)]
*  It just, it's almost like surprising if he doesn't get one that one jump out to you. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=792.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=796.5600000000001s)]
*  We go crazy about it on the ring or pregame show. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=796.84s)]
*  And I don't know if there's like a million props, so they'll throw in one you [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=799.0s)]
*  could win on automatically there, but it's so easy there it's minus one 10. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=801.8000000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=806.88s)]
*  Right in there. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=807.24s)]
*  He's 10 of the last 13 games he scored a touchdown. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=807.8s)]
*  So why that should that be almost even odds and they have a play designed for it. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=810.56s)]
*  So it's almost suspicious. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=815.28s)]
*  Here's another one that goes along with it. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=817.16s)]
*  Shortest touchdown under minus one, uh, under one and a half yards. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=819.52s)]
*  No, we used to love this one. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=823.92s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=825.64s)]
*  We bet that a bunch of times. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=826.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=827.5999999999999s)]
*  So the VIG is a little high. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=827.92s)]
*  It's minus one 72, but we loved it before the tush push. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=829.4399999999999s)]
*  And now it's like, you know, it was, he, he did a twice last matchup twice, first [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=833.7199999999999s)]
*  San Francisco, uh, first time four to the five in the Superbowl seven of the last [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=840.52s)]
*  nine Superbowls have seen a shortest touchdown under one and a half yards. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=845.5999999999999s)]
*  What are the, what are the ads on that? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=849.5999999999999s)]
*  It's minus one 72. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=851.5999999999999s)]
*  It's not great. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=852.88s)]
*  So you might just want to take Hertz for the, uh, touchdown minus one 10, but for [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=853.4799999999999s)]
*  seven of the last nine Superbowls, it didn't hit last year, so that's why I [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=858.1999999999999s)]
*  like it especially now. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=861.8s)]
*  I really liked that. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=863.8s)]
*  So Fandl has, they have that, uh, that anytime touchdown that like either first [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=865.56s)]
*  one or last one of the game that they're putting a pretty big thing on that you [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=871.4399999999999s)]
*  could get in if it's an anytime TD bet and it ends up being the first touchdown [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=876.4s)]
*  in the game, you end up in this bonus bets pool if it's the last touchdown of [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=880.52s)]
*  the game, same thing. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=884.52s)]
*  And I think Kurtz was my favorite anytime touchdown bet. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=886.28s)]
*  I, I bet that goes up. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=889.3199999999999s)]
*  I think that's going to be like minus one 35 by game time. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=890.5999999999999s)]
*  Um, two other things with him longest run was 11 and a half yards. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=893.8s)]
*  And it feels like every game they have that one run where it's like the delayed [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=898.2399999999999s)]
*  QB draw and he's running to the right or the left and he just goes for like 30 [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=903.2399999999999s)]
*  yards and I can't believe that wouldn't happen in this game once. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=907.28s)]
*  So 11 and a half, I really liked. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=911.3599999999999s)]
*  And then longest pass of the game for him, 32 and a half yards. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=913.64s)]
*  So, and this ties into some, some AJ Brown stats too, but, um, when you look [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=919.68s)]
*  at the chiefs, so they gave up in GEDS Buffalo, they gave up a 34 yarder, a 24 [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=926.12s)]
*  yarder and 23 yarder against Houston. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=932.04s)]
*  They give up a 34 yarder, a 24 yarder and 24 yarder. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=934.12s)]
*  So they do give up big plays when you watch where it's like that bend, but don't [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=938.16s)]
*  break, but you can get the, you can bust one on them. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=941.8s)]
*  So I was thinking, I liked that one too. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=945.12s)]
*  The, the just longest one, 33 yard pass to somebody, AJ Brown, Devonta Smith. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=946.76s)]
*  Maybe he's got it. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=952.5600000000001s)]
*  Maybe Barkley on a wheel route. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=953.32s)]
*  Don't you think they'll bust one? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=955.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I like that a lot. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=957.28s)]
*  I mean, I love Spagnola's defense, but it does, um, you know, it takes a [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=958.5600000000001s)]
*  minute to settle in sometimes and I think you could break a tackle or [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=962.96s)]
*  something in there. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=966.12s)]
*  That's a good one. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=966.92s)]
*  What'd you feel about passing yards? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=968.08s)]
*  There's two, there's two 10.5 is the, uh, over under for her. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=970.32s)]
*  It's you could go 175 plus passing yards for him as minus three 10. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=974.32s)]
*  I, I think they're too goofy. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=979.72s)]
*  I almost feel like the total pass yards is a stay away for him. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=981.4000000000001s)]
*  Cause we've seen games where they just run the ball at the time. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=984.36s)]
*  We've also seen games where they've aired out. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=987.88s)]
*  I don't, it doesn't make sense to me. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=989.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=991.24s)]
*  So I think you have to like script it out in your head, right? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=991.6s)]
*  Because for a lot of these last games, he was winning with 154 yards passing. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=994.1600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=999.0400000000001s)]
*  And then last week he kind of surprised us. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=999.72s)]
*  He's like throwing on third and six. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1001.6s)]
*  We're like, what are you doing? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1003.12s)]
*  You have a fourth and one play that never fails. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1004.12s)]
*  Why are you throwing on third and six? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1006.0400000000001s)]
*  And he would complete it to Vaughn Smith and, and AJ Brown. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1007.52s)]
*  They had big game. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1010.32s)]
*  So what do you feel? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1011.1600000000001s)]
*  Do you feel like they're going to play catch up? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1012.84s)]
*  If you feel like they're going to have to play catch up at some point or that, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1014.36s)]
*  Hey, it's a super bowl. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1017.2800000000001s)]
*  Just scoring just gets out of hand. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1018.2800000000001s)]
*  Uh, then I think you go over, but otherwise if you're a pro [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1020.0400000000001s)]
*  Barkley on everything, I mean, his three plus touchdowns hurts is 36 to one. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1022.6s)]
*  Barclays three plus touchdowns is 15 to one. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1026.72s)]
*  So you can have fun with those too. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1029.16s)]
*  So out of those Barkley hurts, what's your favorite one? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1030.88s)]
*  I think I like the rush yard record for plus five to one on [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1033.4s)]
*  Barkley just for the hell of it. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1037.0s)]
*  I like your two touchdowns and I like the anytime TD in the longest [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1038.68s)]
*  past longest run for Hertz. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1042.4s)]
*  It's like, I feel like you at least split those. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1044.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1046.3200000000002s)]
*  I also like shake one or hurts to have two or more touchdowns at plus one seven. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1046.88s)]
*  I was like banging my head against the desk, trying to figure out which of [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1051.3600000000001s)]
*  these two is going to get two or more. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1054.0s)]
*  And then Fandl has a spot for it where either they have like an either or [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1055.8000000000002s)]
*  guy thing, uh, say one or hurts two plus touchdowns plus one 70. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1059.48s)]
*  You're almost definitely. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1063.56s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1064.48s)]
*  That's that's those are way better odds than the Barkley plus two 80. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1064.96s)]
*  Yeah, you're going to get, you're going to be one away at halftime, right? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1068.24s)]
*  You're just going to need some luck to push it over the top. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1071.6000000000001s)]
*  Too bad. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1074.4s)]
*  You can't hedge that. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1074.88s)]
*  AJ Brown. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1076.3600000000001s)]
*  I didn't really have any stuff I like for him. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1077.0800000000002s)]
*  Some of the, some of the stuff isn't out yet. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1079.28s)]
*  That usually comes Wednesday, Thursday, like the completion [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1081.44s)]
*  bets and things like that. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1084.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1085.44s)]
*  I'm staying away. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1085.92s)]
*  Any other Eagles bets that you're fired up about? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1086.44s)]
*  Uh, I like the Vontae Smith. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1088.8000000000002s)]
*  I think they, um, they have, uh, for Eagles, not, not too much like 70 [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1090.48s)]
*  plus for him is plus two Oh five 80 plus is plus three 20. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1095.3600000000001s)]
*  So if you've got that long play in there and you think it's going to be him, um, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1098.48s)]
*  we haven't done chiefs yet, right? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1102.5600000000002s)]
*  That we're going to know what our vote. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1103.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1105.0400000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1105.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1105.3600000000001s)]
*  So that's really it. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1105.5200000000002s)]
*  So I also, um, kicker prop here. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1106.3200000000002s)]
*  L. A. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1110.16s)]
*  I think it's going to be a, it's going to be a, it's going to be a, it's going to be a [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1111.0s)]
*  kicker prop here. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1114.6000000000001s)]
*  Elliot over seven and a half. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1115.76s)]
*  Like you think to yourself, Oh, this team's always going on fourth and one. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1117.8000000000002s)]
*  They don't have, you know, they're not going to kick. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1120.68s)]
*  He's gone seven straight games where he's got had seven and a half or more points [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1122.96s)]
*  and he had nine in the super bowl. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1127.4s)]
*  So the tush push doesn't really factor into like their scoring [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1128.88s)]
*  chances with Jake Elliott. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1132.3600000000001s)]
*  So what are the odds on the seven and a half? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1134.16s)]
*  It's just even odds. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1136.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1137.0s)]
*  Minus one time. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1137.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1138.72s)]
*  Cause one of the ones, one of the bets that's not out yet is the [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1138.92s)]
*  Miss field goal thing for him. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1141.52s)]
*  Cause he's. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1142.8400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1143.96s)]
*  Always feels like he, uh, he has one at some point. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1144.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1148.2s)]
*  So on the chief side, some of my home's bets that jumped out to me over [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1148.4s)]
*  29 and a half rush yards, just too many times with his legs. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1153.76s)]
*  Like, if you look at the biggest games he's played, the completions, I'm sorry, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1158.24s)]
*  the carries are more exciting to me. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1163.56s)]
*  Five and a half carries. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1166.6000000000001s)]
*  Cause you get that 29 and a half rush yards. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1168.24s)]
*  Yep. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1170.8400000000001s)]
*  You have the potential of the Neil's knocking about. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1171.3200000000002s)]
*  The carries are the carries that's minus one 40. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1173.44s)]
*  So there's some cheese. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1175.68s)]
*  He'll help you with the carries. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1176.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1177.56s)]
*  This year he was 11 for 43 against Buffalo. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1178.2s)]
*  He was seven for 14 against Houston, including the three nails at the end. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1180.72s)]
*  Uh, in 2023, nine for 66 against San Fran, six for 15 against Baltimore [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1184.96s)]
*  and six for 19 against Buffalo. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1191.4s)]
*  So the last five times he's had six or more. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1193.28s)]
*  And then if you look at the super bowls, the other super bowls, the Philly [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1196.0s)]
*  one, six for 44, the Tampa one, five for 33 San Francisco nine for 29. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1199.64s)]
*  So the only time he didn't get five and a half out of, you know, eight of the [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1205.2s)]
*  biggest games is career and all the super bowls is that one Tampa game [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1210.24s)]
*  when he had five nuts, six. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1214.2800000000002s)]
*  So to me over carries minus one 40. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1216.2s)]
*  I'm putting the juice on. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1218.72s)]
*  I'm doing it. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1219.72s)]
*  I like that a lot. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1220.8000000000002s)]
*  Um, yeah, he infamously went under and yards when he had that eclipse, right? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1221.96s)]
*  And San Francisco and the super bowl when he started taking Neal's, I like, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1226.96s)]
*  much like you do, it hurts. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1230.92s)]
*  I like over 11 and a half longest rush from my homes. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1232.32s)]
*  He's hit this in four of his last five games, uh, averaging 13 for [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1235.32s)]
*  a longest over that stretch. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1239.32s)]
*  So yeah, I mean, I think that's how you play my home. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1241.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1245.1200000000001s)]
*  I'd be a little nervous about the actual yardage, but [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1245.3600000000001s)]
*  so the other one, if you want to do a yardage bet, I would recommend the [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1248.8400000000001s)]
*  40 plus rush yards from my homes. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1253.08s)]
*  That's plus one 80. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1255.72s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1257.52s)]
*  And again, 43 against Buffalo 66 against San Francisco, 44 against Philly. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1258.0s)]
*  So he's done it a few times. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1265.04s)]
*  You're basically getting two to one odds, but I think he's going to need to do it [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1266.48s)]
*  in this game because Philly's the way they're going to probably play defense [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1269.04s)]
*  in him, they have those four guys. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1273.16s)]
*  They play everybody else back. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1275.16s)]
*  They fake blitz. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1276.48s)]
*  They do all these different things, but if you're just rushing those four, he can [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1277.24s)]
*  just slide out and over and over again, find these pockets. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1280.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1283.92s)]
*  I like that. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1284.2s)]
*  I like him with his legs in this game. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1284.52s)]
*  And he's healthy too. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1286.08s)]
*  We know he's healthy. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1286.9199999999998s)]
*  He's healthy. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1287.96s)]
*  He's also, there's a, there's a stat for him or a bet for him under one and under [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1288.6399999999999s)]
*  two and a half sacks that he takes. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1293.32s)]
*  He's hit this in four of his last five, you know, as I mean, he knows when to take off. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1295.3999999999999s)]
*  He's just the smartest there is. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1299.3999999999999s)]
*  So my home's under two and a half sacks. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1300.56s)]
*  That's a good one. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1304.9199999999998s)]
*  Cause if he's over two and a half sacks, Casey's probably not winning. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1306.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1310.08s)]
*  So Kareem hunt is somebody that really fascinates me. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1310.4399999999998s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1314.6399999999999s)]
*  Anytime touchdown for him is plus one 35. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1315.64s)]
*  He scored in the last four games, two touchdowns for him is plus nine 50. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1318.2s)]
*  And the reason I mentioned it is because my homes, they don't run sneaks with him. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1323.52s)]
*  So unless my home scores from like the four yard line or the seven, like when [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1326.4s)]
*  it's around the goal line, they go with running backs his 50 plus yards is plus [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1329.96s)]
*  one 15 for rushing 70 plus yards is plus three 20 most rushing yards in a game. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1334.6000000000001s)]
*  If you like Casey is seven to one for hunt. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1340.52s)]
*  But I, you know, I was looking back at the Houston game and then especially [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1343.4s)]
*  the Buffalo game, he was 17 for 64 in that Buffalo game and they threw to him once. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1347.56s)]
*  Pacheco is five for 12. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1352.36s)]
*  I think the Eagles are big. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1353.72s)]
*  Pacheco is like a little guy. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1355.64s)]
*  I actually think hunts going to be the guy for them in this game. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1356.88s)]
*  And I feel like it's gravitating toward them anyway, or for that anyway, when, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1359.6s)]
*  uh, the bigger the moment it is, it just seems like they like having hunt out there. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1363.64s)]
*  So I kind of like all the hunt bets. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1367.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1371.32s)]
*  He's their tush push, right? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1371.68s)]
*  Like he's a, he's a wrecking ball at the one or two yard line. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1373.0s)]
*  So they give it to him. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1375.76s)]
*  He goes in, um, Pacheco, I would only take his like receiving props. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1376.64s)]
*  I don't, I don't think they trust them. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1381.8s)]
*  I don't trust them as a running back over four and a half longest [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1383.6s)]
*  reception for Pacheco's hit 13 at the last 17th. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1386.68s)]
*  Um, he averages like nine over that stretch, but let me, let me throw this by you. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1390.12s)]
*  I'm putting a little on my homes for first touchdown at 18 to one. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1395.8s)]
*  I know because he got injured, they don't do the tush push. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1399.72s)]
*  Um, a little talked about play. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1402.68s)]
*  It should be spoken about more is when he rushed to the line of scrimmage [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1405.6000000000001s)]
*  against Buffalo and did that, um, end around that, basically that bootleg [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1408.56s)]
*  to get the first down, I think Andy Reed wants to have an F you moment here, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1412.56s)]
*  whether it's a Philly special or something. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1416.52s)]
*  I think I could see him wanting my homes to score from the one. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1418.96s)]
*  I don't know if it's early on or late in the game, but you might get, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1421.64s)]
*  you might get a sneak, I mean, I don't know why. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1425.48s)]
*  Is he more likely to get injured? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1428.8400000000001s)]
*  I know he got injured on the sneak years ago, but yeah, they've just [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1430.8799999999999s)]
*  never tried it since he got here. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1435.12s)]
*  Right along those lines. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1437.1599999999999s)]
*  There was a chief's prop. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1438.48s)]
*  I liked it was over four and a half guys that rushed the ball. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1439.48s)]
*  And this basically goes down to P Ryan of P Ryan, right? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1444.56s)]
*  He runs the ball. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1447.9199999999998s)]
*  They get to five because worthy has a, at least one carry every game, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1448.72s)]
*  hunt and Pacheco my homes is going to run. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1451.9199999999998s)]
*  So you're basically better in period. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1454.76s)]
*  P Ryan has no runs in the playoffs and the chiefs always zag when they [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1455.8799999999999s)]
*  get to the super bowl. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1460.56s)]
*  So I wonder, is there like the one it's like third and nine. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1461.44s)]
*  Oh my God, it's a draw, draw play to P Ryan, but I like the four and a half over. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1464.56s)]
*  I did the, it's going to come down to like a stupid replay because my homes, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1468.8799999999999s)]
*  you might get P Ryan, but it could be just like a little flip play where [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1474.36s)]
*  it counts as a pass. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1477.2s)]
*  Oh, then it's like a, yeah, that would suck. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1478.32s)]
*  Um, yeah, the, the Mahomes stuff, I love this stuff with his legs, the hunt stuff. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1480.96s)]
*  I think he's going to actually, you know, be pretty prominently involved. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1486.6s)]
*  The guy that I can't get a handle on is Kelsey who's, oh, you just figure the [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1491.92s)]
*  yards for all of his props are five yards higher than they should be. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1496.96s)]
*  Cause he's the most public prop bet there is, you can do 80 plus yards for him is [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1499.92s)]
*  plus two 35 seven plus receptions is plus one 35. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1504.36s)]
*  And then there's that 25 plus yards each half, each half two to one. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1508.48s)]
*  Um, I, to me, he's a stay away. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1513.52s)]
*  I didn't like how he disappeared in that last game, no, Nakobe Dean. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1516.52s)]
*  So maybe that's, maybe that's a way for him to, but I just feel like [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1520.96s)]
*  they're going to take them out. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1524.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1526.2s)]
*  I'm torn here because maybe they stole enough money from us in the AFC [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1526.76s)]
*  championship game, cause we all bet Kelsey props, right? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1530.6399999999999s)]
*  So maybe that's okay. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1533.52s)]
*  So maybe he comes back and we know I gave you his Superbowl numbers, right? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1534.76s)]
*  Like three Oh seven, I think in three games. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1539.28s)]
*  But there's another way to do this. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1541.88s)]
*  I like, I'm looking at no Noah gray for a long of 10 or more yards because the [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1544.0400000000002s)]
*  Eagles weren't great against the tight ends, right? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1548.8000000000002s)]
*  Like, um, what was it? [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1551.48s)]
*  It was Zach Ertz went for 110. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1552.8400000000001s)]
*  They have like 10 catches or something last week, something crazy. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1554.68s)]
*  Noah Gray's 10 or more for a long, uh, he's hitting 12 of the last 17. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1557.88s)]
*  So that could be, I mean, it's just even even up. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1562.76s)]
*  Uh, but you know, that could be something that that's a good one. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1566.8400000000001s)]
*  They go to him a lot too. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1570.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1571.6s)]
*  I like that one. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1571.84s)]
*  So you agree that Kelsey's a stay? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1572.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1574.0s)]
*  I think the yards is just tough with him. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1574.24s)]
*  So I would do the first half, second half. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1577.12s)]
*  That's it. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1579.16s)]
*  Um, game props, my favorite ones. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1580.3999999999999s)]
*  Both teams get a fourth down conversion is minus one 24. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1584.76s)]
*  I don't, I can't remember the last NFL game I watched where both [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1588.52s)]
*  teams didn't get a fourth down. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1591.68s)]
*  The Eagles seem to get at least one every game. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1592.92s)]
*  Minus one 24 seems like a layup. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1595.12s)]
*  And I don't, I had this written down. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1597.96s)]
*  They, I mean, they've gotten a fourth down conversion in every [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1599.68s)]
*  playoff game this year, both teams. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1602.0800000000002s)]
*  So that's, that's five and O and they're 70% plus on the year. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1603.8400000000001s)]
*  And that's top three in the league. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1609.28s)]
*  So great. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1610.64s)]
*  There's another one that I wouldn't recommend, but I thought it was [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1611.8400000000001s)]
*  interesting just cause I thought the odds would have been like more [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1614.76s)]
*  better for the better, um, fourth down conversion in your own territory. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1618.6000000000001s)]
*  Minus one 14. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1623.5600000000002s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1625.4s)]
*  Like, why is that like plus one 60? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1626.1200000000001s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1628.76s)]
*  It's so weird to go, go in your own territory, but if that's minus one 14, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1629.68s)]
*  then why wouldn't I just bet on both teams to get a fourth down conversion? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1633.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1636.48s)]
*  You know, that's the way to do it. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1637.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1638.72s)]
*  So successful two point conversion, a bet that I think we've done the last [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1640.3600000000001s)]
*  couple of years and the odds still haven't shifted enough on it's plus one 75. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1645.8s)]
*  It feels like we have one every year. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1650.0800000000002s)]
*  You know, I looked at it and it felt like it, but it's not, it's not true. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1652.2s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1656.44s)]
*  Did I, I just, I tested that. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1657.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1659.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean, look at the scores are all like 20, you know, I think, uh, you need a [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1660.3200000000002s)]
*  guy, you need a kicker probably to miss at some point and some weird shit to [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1665.2s)]
*  happen, but are you looking for four bull teams or one team is it, you said one [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1669.92s)]
*  team converts, says any two, any successful two point conversion is, is a plus one 75. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1673.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1680.24s)]
*  All right. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1680.8s)]
*  So I think you need like five touchdowns. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1681.2s)]
*  You're going to, and one of them is a two point conversion. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1683.0800000000002s)]
*  How about a 60 yard reception for either team plus four 35, 60 yard plus. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1686.0s)]
*  That's like one worthy down the sideline or one AJ Brown. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1692.68s)]
*  I wanted the odds to be better for that. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1697.0800000000002s)]
*  Seems like a super bowl play maybe. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1699.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1700.72s)]
*  And then, um, this is one of my favorites. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1702.24s)]
*  Philly wins the time of possession minus one 28. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1706.76s)]
*  I went back and looked and they've won like almost every week. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1711.0800000000002s)]
*  It feels like. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1714.3200000000002s)]
*  And if you think they're going to win the game, then they're [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1715.68s)]
*  going to win the time possession. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1718.1200000000001s)]
*  I had the eight, seven points as well. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1720.3200000000002s)]
*  Did you have Jalen Carter over three and a half tackles and assists for plus one 20? [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1722.72s)]
*  I did write that down. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1727.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1728.24s)]
*  I mean, he's a fucking maniac. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1728.72s)]
*  How is he not going to get four tackles and assists? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1730.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1732.88s)]
*  I had the John over, uh, or Dajin over one and a half assists. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1733.6000000000001s)]
*  He's hit this in five straight and I'm going to Mitchell under a half of the [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1736.88s)]
*  assist he's five out of six. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1740.76s)]
*  If you go under there, by the way, I did have, sorry. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1742.24s)]
*  Kelsey. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1745.12s)]
*  This could be a good, uh, Kelsey one. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1746.08s)]
*  Now, of course I lost it. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1748.36s)]
*  Um, no, forget it. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1750.08s)]
*  Oh, no, Kelsey. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1753.1999999999998s)]
*  First catch for Kansas city plus two 30 last two super bowls. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1754.12s)]
*  He's had the first catch. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1757.9599999999998s)]
*  What was it? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1759.52s)]
*  Plus two 30 plus two 30. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1759.9199999999998s)]
*  Last two circles. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1761.84s)]
*  They had a one yard catch and a 20 yard catch. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1762.52s)]
*  My favorite product. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=1766.6799999999998s)]

*  You got 22 to one, 11 to one, 23 to one, five times those numbers of it. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2073.76s)]
*  Live it up, man. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2078.0s)]
*  Live it up. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2079.28s)]
*  Uh, let's see. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2080.2400000000002s)]
*  What else do I want to do? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2081.76s)]
*  Oh, here's something interesting. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2083.48s)]
*  So they have the playoff leaders, right? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2084.88s)]
*  So that up until like wild card. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2086.64s)]
*  I saw that. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2088.3599999999997s)]
*  So isn't who's the guy who's still winning for receivers? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2088.72s)]
*  De'Ami Brown. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2092.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2093.7599999999998s)]
*  229 yards. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2094.72s)]
*  He's plus 360. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2096.2s)]
*  I think he could hold on. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2098.2s)]
*  I think this is where he shines. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2099.48s)]
*  I think he shines next Sunday by not being in the game. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2101.0s)]
*  He is, uh, Goddard has 188. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2104.64s)]
*  So if you don't think Goddard will have 46, you're good there. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2107.12s)]
*  Kelsey has 136. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2109.8799999999997s)]
*  He would need, you know, 90 something. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2112.04s)]
*  And worthy has 130. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2114.8s)]
*  I just think plus 360 for the leader at this point might be a, a decent way to go. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2116.1200000000003s)]
*  I almost wonder if the move is to bet the over on Goddard, but then you also [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2121.04s)]
*  got the De'Ami Brown vest and you can hedge it either way. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2124.6400000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2127.2400000000002s)]
*  You're smarter than I am with that. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2127.5600000000004s)]
*  Playhouse. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2129.0800000000004s)]
*  So playoff leaders. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2130.44s)]
*  That's such a fun one. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2132.1200000000003s)]
*  I can't believe so Goddard's the favorite of minus one 25. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2133.8s)]
*  De'Ami Brown is plus two 80. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2136.76s)]
*  That was two 80 now. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2139.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2140.1200000000003s)]
*  And then, uh, worthy's 10 to one and keep going. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2140.36s)]
*  Worthy's 10 to one and keeps going and keeps going. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2143.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2146.1600000000003s)]
*  Well, if you think that 60 yard of the worthy's coming, maybe that's the way to do it. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2146.48s)]
*  But, um, all right. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2149.7200000000003s)]
*  Uh, Braden man, Eagles punter under 55 and a half longest punt, only over 55, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2151.6400000000003s)]
*  four times all regular season. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2157.56s)]
*  Who knows if he'll even punt, right? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2159.52s)]
*  He had two against Washington. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2161.0s)]
*  His long punt. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2162.6800000000003s)]
*  Like you'd almost, that would almost have to bounce because the guy didn't pick it up. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2164.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2168.28s)]
*  I got that. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2168.6s)]
*  That's one of those that question. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2169.08s)]
*  Dofamensa, the Vikings GM. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2170.56s)]
*  That almost would make me nervous that that line is so high. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2175.4s)]
*  Like Fandl knows something. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2178.04s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2179.52s)]
*  It's like a giant punt. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2182.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2183.88s)]
*  Uh, it is a lot. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2185.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2187.52s)]
*  Jersey number for the first touchdown over 15 and a half. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2187.7999999999997s)]
*  You lose the quarterbacks, but you get almost every defensive player. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2191.84s)]
*  You get Barkley, you get Goddard, you get Chelsea, you get Hunt. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2195.0s)]
*  You get Peyton Hender shot. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2198.36s)]
*  I love it. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2200.7999999999997s)]
*  Over 15 and a half. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2201.52s)]
*  Even odds for that. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2202.56s)]
*  Even odds? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2203.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2205.6s)]
*  Well, they have to have a number. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2206.08s)]
*  They put it right at the Kelsey line there. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2207.04s)]
*  15. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2208.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but there's got to be some other player that's under 15. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2209.2s)]
*  Davonta Smith is under 15. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2211.84s)]
*  Well, Hertz is under, both quarterbacks. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2213.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2215.2s)]
*  Davonta Smith. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2215.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2217.68s)]
*  He's number six. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2218.04s)]
*  AJ Brown. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2219.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2220.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2220.64s)]
*  And AJ Brown's number 11. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2220.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2222.6s)]
*  I just like having Barkley and Kelsey for almost a year. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2222.72s)]
*  And Noah Gray. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2226.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2228.04s)]
*  And my guy Noah Gray. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2228.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2229.8799999999997s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2230.56s)]
*  What else do we have here? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2230.96s)]
*  They have next gen stats. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2233.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2236.96s)]
*  Did you see, I don't even know how they would do this because [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2237.7599999999998s)]
*  worthy to register fastest is plus 285 and he is the fastest. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2240.48s)]
*  But so what if it's like an eight yard catch? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2245.92s)]
*  Do they really just measure how fast it wouldn't be able to get [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2249.3199999999997s)]
*  speed probably in that spot. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2252.04s)]
*  So you're basically betting that he's going to have the [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2253.7599999999998s)]
*  longest play at plus 285. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2256.24s)]
*  It seems like it would have to be a pass. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2258.96s)]
*  That's at least 25 yards, right? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2261.48s)]
*  Or a run that's at least 25 yards so the guy can get the full head of steam. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2264.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2268.56s)]
*  So that's why Barkley is the favorite for that one. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2268.92s)]
*  So he's, he's supposed to have the longest play. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2271.76s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2274.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2275.44s)]
*  I'm going to bet on Travis Kelsey. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2276.12s)]
*  I just feel like he's looking fast lately. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2277.64s)]
*  Just seems like, just seems like, uh, now I would bet I'm worthy on that in the [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2280.44s)]
*  three to one odds and then hope that he gets lucky. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2286.2s)]
*  I mean, it's crazy. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2289.2799999999997s)]
*  Imagine Jimmy the Greek looking at this. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2290.04s)]
*  Like you could have worthy at 18 and a half miles per hour. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2291.72s)]
*  Like that's minus 172 to do that. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2294.52s)]
*  Jimmy the Greek would probably end up saying something racist about the [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2297.0s)]
*  bet and it would make him uncomfortable. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2300.0s)]
*  Position first touchdown. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2303.56s)]
*  What would you say? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2305.96s)]
*  Which, which would you go with? [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2306.8399999999997s)]
*  Probably running back. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2310.96s)]
*  Running back is plus 185. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2312.6s)]
*  Tight end would intrigue me though. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2313.12s)]
*  Cause you have Kelsey gray and got her. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2314.48s)]
*  Tight ends plus four 20. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2316.44s)]
*  It's not bad. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2317.7999999999997s)]
*  That's what I was looking at there. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2319.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2320.68s)]
*  Tight end plus four 20 first touchdown. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2321.3199999999997s)]
*  I like that. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2325.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2325.4s)]
*  I think it's still four 20. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2325.64s)]
*  Um, you know, we were talking about the FU moment for, for Reed against the Eagles. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2327.4s)]
*  I know he's played him ready. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2333.3199999999997s)]
*  Any quarterback to receive a touchdown 70 to one alignment to score 18 to one. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2334.16s)]
*  A quarterback, either quarterback catches a pass is 21 to not, uh, to one. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2340.12s)]
*  That's pretty good. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2345.68s)]
*  I know these things don't happen a ton, but this is it. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2346.3599999999997s)]
*  There's your last chance to use the trick play for the year. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2349.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2351.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2352.8399999999997s)]
*  I can't see Casey doing it with my homes. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2353.4s)]
*  So it basically come down to Jaylin hurts. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2356.3199999999997s)]
*  And then if you're Sirianni, do you want to rip off the Philly special or a play [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2358.64s)]
*  like that and then it doesn't work and like, Oh, look at fucking Sirianni. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2362.4s)]
*  Trying to do the goal line. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2366.3199999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2367.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2368.3199999999997s)]
*  But maybe, maybe the 21 to one, just to catch a pass could be interesting. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2368.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2373.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2374.08s)]
*  Uh, then you get the stupid stuff. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2374.56s)]
*  I mean, I I'm going purple Gatorade. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2376.44s)]
*  It's gone down already. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2378.36s)]
*  It was plus two 40. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2379.44s)]
*  Oh, there's an action. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2380.44s)]
*  You could bet it on Fandl now, which is a freaking miracle. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2381.88s)]
*  Uh, purple's down to two to one. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2385.48s)]
*  It was purple the last two years. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2388.4s)]
*  The chiefs won the last two years. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2390.4s)]
*  It was purple. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2391.7999999999997s)]
*  Why would they screw with a good thing? [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2392.36s)]
*  Um, purple has a chance to catch orange as the high, uh, got orange is five. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2394.32s)]
*  Purple is four of all the super bowls. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2400.0s)]
*  Uh, you know, we've got the Kobe thing. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2402.56s)]
*  It's been five years since Kobe's gone. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2405.44s)]
*  You could go Kurt purple there. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2407.2400000000002s)]
*  If you're the Eagles, uh, you know, I think I just also, let's just talk about [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2408.96s)]
*  Kendrick Lamar has like an Easter thing going. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2413.12s)]
*  Maybe it's in his rider that there has to be purple Gatorade. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2415.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2418.96s)]
*  Purple two to one seems like a good, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2419.6400000000003s)]
*  uh, that sounds, I could probably get inside info on that. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2421.3199999999997s)]
*  The there's, there's some sort of purple something. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2423.96s)]
*  There's too much action on purple. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2426.2799999999997s)]
*  Maybe it's, maybe it's that Luca went to the Lakers. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2428.68s)]
*  Now it's like a whole purple week. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2430.96s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2432.96s)]

*  No, just Luca. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2438.7999999999997s)]
*  It's the go to the Lakers. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2439.7599999999998s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2442.3199999999997s)]

*  Versa climber. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2446.7999999999997s)]
*  It's like, cool. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2447.56s)]
*  Nobody's going to win the title now for the next seven years. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2448.2s)]
*  Listen, no one was more surprised than LeBron. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2450.7599999999998s)]
*  He found out, what was he getting? [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2453.04s)]
*  Like a bacon wrapped hot dog in New York after the next game. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2454.3999999999996s)]
*  He had nothing to do with this at all. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2457.9199999999996s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2459.56s)]
*  He had no idea. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2460.0s)]
*  It's good. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2460.72s)]
*  No, no idea. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2461.2799999999997s)]
*  Um, I'd like to see big Dom get involved in this Gatorade scandal. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2462.64s)]
*  Doesn't this seem like something like big Dom switches it out and some [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2467.72s)]
*  mobsters hit big on this prop. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2471.08s)]
*  I think that's how this one's going down. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2473.16s)]
*  Uh, John Batiste anthem. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2475.16s)]
*  This one, you might not be able to find that. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2477.24s)]
*  I think this is going to be a great example of how big the [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2479.12s)]
*  Gatorade scandal is. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2482.48s)]
*  He's got a big, it's huge, huge, huge, huge, big Gatorade scandal. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2484.08s)]
*  120 and a half seconds. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2489.4s)]
*  He did a minute, 35, which is 95 seconds at the NBA all-star game in 2017. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2491.8399999999997s)]
*  Does he show off 30 seconds worth? [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2498.68s)]
*  How many, 120 seconds? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2502.88s)]
*  That seems like a lot. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2504.7999999999997s)]
*  It's two minutes. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2505.88s)]
*  Is Lewis going to be at this thing again? [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2506.68s)]
*  Did we win? [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2509.24s)]
*  Yeah, we won because he told us what was going to happen. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2510.12s)]
*  He was in the building. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2513.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's like the best inside info. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2514.04s)]
*  I had the flip side of it though. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2516.52s)]
*  Nick Khan, my friend Nick Khan, who runs WWE, we saw his son at UFC a few weeks ago and we were talking Royal Rumble. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2518.04s)]
*  And his son, Sonny, who's a great kid, and he's like, Sonny, what's going to happen to the Rumble? [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2525.0s)]
*  And he goes, John Cena is going to win the Royal Rumble and then he's going to wrestle Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2530.2799999999997s)]
*  And we were like, holy shit. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2536.92s)]
*  And then John Cena was one of the last two and then he lost. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2538.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2541.88s)]
*  Sonny swerved us. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2542.44s)]
*  He's learning from the best. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2543.5600000000004s)]
*  Wow. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2545.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2545.8s)]
*  If you can't trust WWE inside info. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2546.1200000000003s)]
*  I can't trust a nine-year-old son of the guy who runs WWE. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2548.28s)]
*  What can I, who can I trust? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2551.88s)]
*  Come on, Nick. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2553.5600000000004s)]
*  Nick's patting his son on the head right now. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2554.6800000000003s)]
*  He's like, great job. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2556.44s)]
*  Good job, son. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2557.2400000000002s)]
*  Did it again. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2558.84s)]
*  Well, I'm trying to figure out. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2561.0800000000004s)]
*  Two or more diss tracks from Kendrick Lamar regarding Drake is minus 400. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2562.28s)]
*  Wow. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2568.36s)]
*  Well, he's definitely playing not like us. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2568.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2570.76s)]
*  So then they would have to maybe does a medley count? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2571.32s)]
*  What if it's a medley with like four songs in it? [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2574.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, they have to because everything's a medley now. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2577.4s)]
*  They don't really stop down for new songs. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2579.4s)]
*  And then there's dumb shit. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2582.36s)]
*  There's Taylor Swift to announce pregnancy during or after Super Bowl 16 to one. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2583.32s)]
*  Will he propose Travis after at eight to one? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2587.48s)]
*  We might just have to do that so that you don't throw up again. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2590.7599999999998s)]
*  Can we talk about the proposal? [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2593.3199999999997s)]
*  Cause why is that still lingering in such a real way? [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2595.56s)]
*  Makes you almost think it's going to happen after the game. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2599.16s)]
*  If the NFL was scripted, the Chiefs would win and then he would propose. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2602.12s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2605.16s)]
*  So eight to one seems high. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2606.8399999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2609.3999999999996s)]
*  And he didn't go to the Grammys, which is going on right now as we're, as right. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2609.8799999999997s)]
*  That's a better bet than Chiefs Moneyline because he's not going to propose if they lose. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2614.04s)]
*  That's true. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2617.8799999999997s)]
*  He's only proposing if they win. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2618.52s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2619.72s)]
*  The Chiefs have lost by 10. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2620.7599999999998s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2622.52s)]
*  Let's go to the field where Travis Kelsey has a special announcement. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2623.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2626.44s)]
*  It has to be a win. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2627.08s)]
*  The Chiefs are going to try harder if they know he has plans to propose. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2627.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2631.4s)]
*  It gets confusing. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2632.12s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2633.48s)]
*  Do you know Metro Boomin? [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2635.0s)]
*  What about him? [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2637.48s)]
*  He's the first celebrity on stage. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2638.2s)]
*  He's plus 125. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2640.28s)]
*  He's the favorite. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2641.48s)]
*  Not Tommy Alter? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2643.48s)]
*  Tommy's favorite. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2645.72s)]
*  Tommy's fourth. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2647.8s)]
*  I had Tommy Alter. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2649.96s)]
*  He's my number one. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2651.16s)]
*  I'm trying to think that might be it before we get to the good stuff there. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2653.8s)]
*  What are the odds of me being in New Orleans? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2658.12s)]
*  Is it, did those come out of the handle? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2660.04s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2661.64s)]
*  You have another NBA thing this week or something? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2662.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2664.28s)]
*  There might be more trades. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2664.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2665.64s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2667.48s)]
*  You got to stick around for these dumb trades. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2668.12s)]
*  As you know, because you've seen it, New Orleans is terrible for me. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2669.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's not fun for you. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2674.04s)]
*  I can't handle it. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2676.04s)]
*  I can't handle it. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2677.3199999999997s)]
*  So that doesn't mean I'm not going to go, but I know that it's a bad city for me. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2679.24s)]
*  Well, the bad thing is you could not even be looking for trouble and get [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2685.7999999999997s)]
*  food poisoning from Roy Oysters. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2689.56s)]
*  How do you say that? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2692.04s)]
*  Yeah, Roy Oysters. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2692.8399999999997s)]
*  You know Roy Oysters. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2695.0s)]
*  Roy Oysters is a new state of comedian. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2696.12s)]
*  He's touring with Jeff Ross and Bill Burr. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2698.2s)]
*  He's going to be the first diss track. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2699.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2702.12s)]
*  So the quick setup for Gary Russell. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2702.52s)]
*  This was a million years ago. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2705.0s)]
*  We were doing a Super Bowl props bet right around when we invented Super Bowl props. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2707.56s)]
*  You did the Gary Russell bet. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2713.7999999999997s)]
*  You had this big bet. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2715.56s)]
*  You're all excited about it. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2716.52s)]
*  I thought it was going to be like Ben Roethlisberger, 280 yards or whatever it was. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2717.56s)]
*  Nope. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2722.3599999999997s)]
*  This was Cardinal Steelers Super Bowl. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2723.0s)]
*  And your big thing was Gary Russell. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2724.7599999999998s)]
*  What was it? [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2727.24s)]
*  He would... [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2727.72s)]
*  To not score a touchdown. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2728.12s)]
*  To not score a touchdown. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2730.04s)]
*  You had studied it, researched it. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2731.48s)]
*  It was minus 150. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2733.4s)]
*  He had like two touchdowns all year. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2734.7599999999998s)]
*  I was like, why is this only minus 150? [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2736.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2738.2s)]
*  So he scores in the first quarter. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2738.52s)]
*  And I think we were watching the Super Bowl together and we're just dying laughing. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2741.0s)]
*  And then we get this email from somebody who said they were at a Super Bowl party. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2746.12s)]
*  There's a male and a female. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2750.2799999999997s)]
*  They both started laughing. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2751.48s)]
*  They didn't know who each other were. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2752.84s)]
*  They were like, do you guys listen? [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2754.2s)]
*  Do you listen to BS report? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2755.48s)]
*  And they ended up getting married. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2756.68s)]
*  I can't believe... [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2757.96s)]
*  So the Gary Russell pot has led to... [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2758.2s)]
*  This pick has led to a marriage. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2760.2s)]
*  It's led to a marriage. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2762.12s)]
*  It's led to almost bankruptcy for me. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2763.16s)]
*  I'm not very good at it. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2766.04s)]
*  Now I pick an underachieving no-name player to have a reception or a carry. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2767.56s)]
*  I hit with Henry Hronowski. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2772.3599999999997s)]
*  It's the least sexy prop you can bet, but you're Adam and Lee. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2774.04s)]
*  Hank Hronowski was the best one, I think. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2777.72s)]
*  That was good. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2779.7999999999997s)]
*  I took your Patriots tight end once. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2780.68s)]
*  That Michael Humanaulally... [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2782.4399999999996s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2784.7599999999998s)]
*  That one hit. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2785.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2786.04s)]
*  Michael Humanaulally. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2786.2799999999997s)]
*  I think that hit. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2787.16s)]
*  But honestly, I don't think I've hit since Fozzie Whitaker. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2788.04s)]
*  And I feel like the Chiefs and Eagles have ruined the Gary Russell special [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2793.56s)]
*  because we kind of know all the third and fourth stringers, right? [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2796.68s)]
*  I'm not going to go with Kenneth Gainwell or Jahan Dotson or... [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2800.2s)]
*  You said some Adjie Prut-P Ryan for the Chiefs. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2804.2799999999997s)]
*  Otherwise, we know the top six receivers. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2807.0s)]
*  So I had to dig deep and here's what I ended up with. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2809.0s)]
*  I was never going to count you out. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2812.7599999999998s)]
*  I knew you would find something. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2814.52s)]
*  You weren't going to quit on Gary Russell. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2815.72s)]
*  No, I can't quit on Gary Russell. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2818.04s)]
*  I can't believe we haven't heard from that couple. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2819.64s)]
*  It must have split early on if that's actually how they met. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2821.64s)]
*  Yeah, maybe that's like a sad story now. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2825.24s)]
*  It's a sad story. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2827.0s)]
*  It's worse. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2828.2s)]
*  Guys living with his parents. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropoQ0sT7uI&t=2829.4s)]
