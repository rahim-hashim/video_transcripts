# Million-Dollar Picks Week 15 With Joe House  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [December 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8tOyQdackw)
*  We're doing really well on million dollar picks.
*  We won $551,000 last week.
*  We are up $1.764 million.
*  It's pretty good.
*  This is one of my favorite weeks of the year.
*  It almost scares me a little.
*  It's playing all the hits for me.
*  I love good to decent teams.
*  Three points are under.
*  I love Mike Tomlin getting points.
*  You could probably guess what my picks are going to be.
*  There's like an easy teaser.
*  So we'll go through some of it.
*  Steelers, Eagles Steelers plus five and a half.
*  I'll let you take the floor because I heard what you said on the Ringer
*  gambling show today and you had a couple points in this game that I just wholeheartedly agreed with.
*  Do your what good defense is Philly played thing.
*  Yeah, well, I went through their list of wins and please don't misunderstand.
*  A nine game winning streak is outstanding.
*  It's excellent.
*  But when you go through the teams that they've beat, I don't think you can get to a top 10 defense.
*  I think you're hard pressed to get to a top 15 defense.
*  Now, they can I give them quick, please, please Cleveland, Cleveland,
*  Giants, Cincy, Jaguars, Cowboys, Washington Rams, Baltimore, Carolina.
*  And it's not like they were throwing up 40 points a game either against those defenses.
*  But that speaks to like just nobody even remotely approaching what Pittsburgh has.
*  Yeah, and I guess Cleveland would be the best out of out of that group.
*  But right.
*  So the thing about Pittsburgh and why I think it's going to be a shock to the system is their ability
*  to bring a pass rush that these Eagles have not seen this entire season.
*  And the Steelers are really rounding into form in terms of their quick pressure rate,
*  their ability to disrupt, and they have health at the linebacker position, both Herbig and Alonzo
*  Highsmith healthy.
*  And I think, yeah, so we already know that this Eagles defense is one dimensional.
*  They are the least passing team in the NFL, the fewest number of attempts and completions
*  in the entire NFL.
*  Jalen Hurtson, this Eagles passing.
*  31st in a passing league that has some horrible quarterbacks.
*  They're 31st out of 32.
*  So you want to give this Steelers defense a one dimensional look?
*  Do you think that they'll load the box and say, please try and run on us?
*  And I think this is finally a matchup where the Eagles very excellent offensive line.
*  Again, don't misunderstand me.
*  That they're going to meet their match in terms of what this Steelers defensive front seven
*  can bring to the table.
*  And Pittsburgh has a way better special teams.
*  Pittsburgh has one of the preeminent special teams of this decade.
*  The season Boswell is having, I think Boswell might be having the greatest fantasy football
*  season by a kicker in the last 15 years.
*  I had him on the vote out league that I'm in with Sal and Henshin, those guys.
*  And I didn't make the playoffs.
*  My team sucked.
*  And I felt bad.
*  I almost felt like sending Boswell letter.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I let you down.
*  You did everything you could.
*  This wasn't your fault.
*  Boswell.
*  You should have figured out a way to put them on a, on a contender.
*  I mean, you know, I understand the dynamics that are at work, but like, is John Ham still
*  alive?
*  He could have done something nice for you.
*  He might have over 200 fantasy points this year.
*  Just out.
*  Right.
*  That's like the kickers don't do that.
*  The top kicker is usually 160, 170.
*  So they have him, the Tomlin factor, Tomlin as an underdog.
*  Philly's first rushing offense, Pittsburgh's fourth against the run in the entire league.
*  Yeah, that's great.
*  And the only thing that worries me is the Pickens part.
*  That's it.
*  They're not going to have Pickens.
*  That's a, that's a viable concern.
*  And you're not imagining a game script here where Pittsburgh tries to get the ball
*  way down the field, which has been, you know, that one of their pathways to success
*  with Russell Wilson, he's been throwing a very nice deep ball, but that's not the way
*  the way that they win this game is field position, special teams, defense, long drives.
*  You're just laying out under left and right.
*  You're absolutely right.
*  I think this has been a season about the general public underestimating things.
*  And Pittsburgh is like the leader of the pack with that.
*  People have underestimated them before the season, as the season was going, people kept
*  looking for reasons.
*  And then this is the most offensive line of them all.
*  Like the Eagles could win and win by 14.
*  I still think the line's offensive.
*  I think it's a three point game.
*  I can't believe it's five and a half, especially with how the Eagles looked last week, barely
*  beating Carolina, having some sniping after the game.
*  And this is like where Pittsburgh loves to be.
*  Like it's going to be the weather's not going to be that bad, but it's a Pennsylvania game.
*  So not, not long travel.
*  And it, to me, it just feels like a 20 to 16, 19 to 16, 21 to 20.
*  So I was looking at different bets.
*  Like the other thing is the Steelers are five and a half.
*  So Vegas is like, we don't know.
*  We're throwing this the Vegas.
*  Steelers plus four and a half on Fando is even money.
*  Steelers plus five and a half is like minus one 13.
*  If you do Steelers plus four and a half with an under 45 and a half, that's plus one 98.
*  It's almost three to one.
*  And I guess my question to you is, so how many points become unrealistic for a game like this?
*  Because we, we, if we don't think the Eagles are going to be able to run the ball, that might
*  actually lead to more long passes, but I don't think the Steelers are going to be able to get
*  the same explosive plays that they used to have.
*  So the model for them to win is just run the ball, run the ball, control it, try to wear the Eagles
*  out. And then on defense, the Eagles stubbornly try to run against them for a half.
*  It doesn't work.
*  And then maybe it opens up second half.
*  But I was looking at that Steelers plus five and a half under 47 and a half is plus one 63.
*  Another great one.
*  As many of these as you want to do, I'm here for it.
*  Steelers win the game outright with under 45 and a half is plus three 28.
*  So there's, there's some great good ones, but I normally, my instinct would be to pull the
*  Steelers up over seven.
*  I don't think, I think in this one, like this is, this feels like a three point game to me.
*  And they've played these games all year.
*  And I think, I think they're going to have a chip on their shoulder and this might be a team.
*  They see in the Superbowl.
*  I couldn't agree more with any of, of your, uh, handicap or assessment there.
*  I want to just add a couple other layers.
*  You mentioned the special teams thing.
*  Tell me how many field goals Jake Elliott has made of 50 yards or longer this season.
*  Oh God, probably like one.
*  The answer is none.
*  Wow.
*  He is over five.
*  So if we're talking about, if we imagine a game script where it's tight, it's, it's, you know,
*  field position kind of game, those 50 yard field goals start to become important.
*  And then the last sort of element of it is like, who do you trust more in a game like this?
*  Nick Sirianni or Mike Tomlin?
*  And you know, that, that also matters.
*  What's the best unit in the game?
*  And I would say it's Pittsburgh's defense.
*  Now, if, if Philly can run the ball on them, we'll know within a quarter and the game's
*  probably over, but I think this, to me, this feels like a close game.
*  It feels like a field position game.
*  Special teams will factor it in.
*  And I just, I like some combination of maybe it's all the way up to 47 and a half.
*  Maybe it's Steelers plus five and a half with the under 47 and a half, something like that.
*  Fine.
*  I think that's the move.
*  Fine.
*  Next one, Lions bills.
*  So this is Lions minus two and a half, which is just a complete FU to the Lions defense
*  by everybody.
*  People are like, you didn't fool us last week.
*  Your team spent 38 seconds calling every play on offense and just doing everything they
*  could to keep the defense off the field.
*  And now you're going to play Josh Allen.
*  We don't trust you.
*  My counter is that the Rams showed what to do against Buffalo last week.
*  They ran the ball.
*  They ran the ball.
*  Then they then play action or quick passes and they just got first downs and moved the
*  ball.
*  And Detroit has a better offense than the Rams do.
*  They have a better offensive line.
*  I don't know how Buffalo, I just feel like they're going to get pushed backwards the
*  whole game.
*  I think that's Buffalo is a team that needs to lead.
*  And I think the Lions are just going to push it back, push it back.
*  Maybe there's a scenario where Josh is straight chasing the cover late, but this defense looks
*  like an awesome matchup for the Lions.
*  So I'm more focused on their offense and less the defensive deficiencies.
*  What are you looking at?
*  Yeah.
*  So this is again, kind of a razor thin coin flip kind of game.
*  And so you're trying to find the teeny tiny slices that might tip it one way or the other.
*  And if you were wanted, if you wanted to back the Bills and grab the points, you would talk
*  about Detroit secondary being susceptible to explosives and the Bills are getting back
*  both Coleman and Kincaid this week.
*  They're supposed to be ready to play.
*  And we saw through the tremendous comeback against the Rams.
*  Shakir was incredible.
*  Allen is at the absolute peak of his powers.
*  And if he is out of structure, you don't worry about Josh Allen out of structure getting
*  the ball down the field.
*  He is the best quarterback that Detroit will have faced this whole season with a pretty
*  healthy offense.
*  And one of the things I'm interested in, I'm looking at it right now.
*  James cook these nuts over because I do think that they are going to try and establish a
*  little run.
*  We're going to go cook these nuts over 52 and a half rushing yards.
*  But that's just a side play for me.
*  So that would be the case.
*  But if the Lions win this, what do you think?
*  30 points for them at least.
*  Oh, I mean, the points are going to be abundant.
*  And I don't want to do this, but I'm just saying, like, if you're taking the Lions,
*  if you're like, I want to take the Lions plus two and a half, I would take Lions,
*  Moneyline and do over 50 and a half something like over 50 and a half Lions.
*  Moneyline is plus two oh six.
*  I would do something like that.
*  This is not going to be a 24 to 16 type of game.
*  I think there's going to be points, but I feel like there's a been a few times this
*  year where Detroit's offense got discounted a little bit.
*  Okay.
*  Even Green Bay last Thursday night, we all love Green Bay.
*  We ended up actually, I think we end up winning that bet.
*  We won our bet because it was, you know, we got the three and a half.
*  Yeah.
*  But Detroit, 34 points, probably could have more.
*  To me, this is just a, just don't overthink it.
*  Lions are home.
*  They need the game.
*  That's the other thing.
*  It's not like they have a three game lead in the NFC.
*  Minnesota is one game behind them.
*  And their offense is just way better than Buffalo's, even though Buffalo's offense
*  is really good.
*  But like Detroit's plus 27 in touchdowns this year, Buffalo's plus 18.
*  Detroit's net yards.
*  They've scored almost a thousand more yards than the other team or gained a thousand
*  more yards.
*  Buffalo's at 300.
*  Buffalo's had weeks where they, they've just looks like they've they're like that
*  Baltimore game, the game last week where it just feels like you can go up and down
*  the field in them.
*  And I like the matchup for Detroit.
*  Here's the thing that really tips it for me.
*  If it's a tight game, we're in the fourth quarter and it's time to strike, start doing
*  some math about the most efficient way to produce an outcome.
*  Yeah, I don't.
*  We just watched it.
*  Sean McDermott just has too many unforced errors in this regard.
*  Yeah.
*  And Dan Campbell never makes a mistake.
*  It is like Dan Campbell and the Lions are at the same level as the chiefs in terms of
*  like, it's an end of game scenario and I've got it mapped out.
*  And I know the correct call to make.
*  We might not execute and we might lose the game because of a failure to execute, but
*  I know the call I'm going to make and it's the right call.
*  And that's how we're going to win McDermott just gets it wrong so many times too often.
*  And I don't want to be in that position of watching this great game back and forth,
*  back and forth.
*  And the bills have the ball and dumb, dumb McDermott makes a dumb, dumb call.
*  And then they're like, God damn it.
*  Why did I invest in this team?
*  Muscle not pot.
*  Like Detroit really needs the game.
*  Buffalo, they're either going to be the two or the three seed.
*  There's urgency, but not like crazy not urgency.
*  Why you think they can drop the four?
*  No, I don't think I don't know if we're going to get to the chiefs, but I'm not
*  after what we watched in that game.
*  Oh, you think they get to the one seed?
*  I'm not ready to cross off that that bigger game.
*  Detroit has to win this game.
*  Fine.
*  Fine.
*  That's fine.
*  Well, Campbell and golf at home last couple of seasons, incredible against the spread.
*  With that said, I hate betting.
*  It's Josh.
*  Oh, sure.
*  More games that I like.
*  Well, there's one I don't that I stared at that I wanted to throw in
*  Chargers minus three at home against the bucks.
*  And I had them written down all week.
*  I kept looking at it, kept looking at the injury report.
*  And this seems like a week to stay away with the Chargers.
*  I just, there's something I don't like about it.
*  The Macaulay is not healthy.
*  Dobbins is out.
*  Herbert now has this sprained ankle situation again.
*  And I feel like this line should be like Chargers by four.
*  And the books are trying to tell us something.
*  So I being a three point underdog, like I, they didn't even look good last week.
*  So it's a stay away to me house.
*  Yeah.
*  And it is a hundred percent the injury uncertainty.
*  It was trending in a way that let me go ahead and get a little bit down on the
*  Chargers minus three, because I think it's a great number for the reason that you just
*  lay it out.
*  I mean, the bucks have a bunch of wins against nobody teams.
*  They beat the giants with Tommy Devito.
*  They beat Carolina in overtime.
*  They play in the NFC sub.
*  Right.
*  I mean, they, they, they handled the Raiders because Aiden O'Connell broke his leg.
*  Like, you know, there's a bunch of ways.
*  Now again, you win, you got to play the games under in front of you on your schedule.
*  Congrats to them, but brutal spot.
*  What's the status of Bucky Irving that will impact the handicap.
*  And then what's the stuff?
*  My conkey was running drills on Wednesday.
*  So I started saying, well, this is part of why I, I went ahead and get, got down a little
*  bit on that Chargers minus three.
*  Yeah, we're saying you can't have Herbert under any circumstances impaired at all
*  because the, the blue, the, what Tampa has been doing these last three weeks very successfully
*  against bad teams is blitz with blitz bliss.
*  They've greatly increased their blitz rate and it's been successful.
*  I know I'm coming on the ringer Sunday pregame on Sunday.
*  I could see being back in on the Chargers on Sunday.
*  I'm not doing it now on a Thursday afternoon.
*  Great.
*  Here's a game I do love.
*  Houston minus two and a half against Miami.
*  Okay.
*  Texas off a bye.
*  Miami's past defense kind of getting semi-shredded by Aaron Rogers.
*  Who's, who's been done for three years.
*  D'Amico Ryan's versus Tua.
*  Raheem talked about that on the ringer gambling show today.
*  There was a San Francisco game with Tua.
*  That was not awesome for Tua Houston's defense, seventh against the
*  pass second in sacks, second in tackles for a loss.
*  Most importantly house.
*  We're kind of due for a good CJ Stroud game.
*  We're just do.
*  I know that's a good,
*  but he's got his receivers back.
*  Nico Collins is back.
*  They're coming off a bye.
*  It just feels like this is a first quarter where they come out swinging,
*  make a couple of big plays.
*  They hit two a couple of times.
*  I don't think Miami is good.
*  And I think if the, to me, this is a gift of a line.
*  This line should be Texans by three and a half.
*  People don't trust Houston.
*  I get it.
*  Not even sure Houston's that good.
*  If they can't win this game, we might have to take their FC South title house.
*  Just give it to somebody else.
*  Well, the culture are, you know, sort of hovering around interesting,
*  matchup against the Broncos.
*  But I understand your point with this Dolphins team.
*  I just can't unsee what the jets did to them.
*  It looked like, you know, Devante Adams was open on every play.
*  It looked like Wilson was open on every play.
*  Nine yard outs over and over again.
*  I just, and it, the, the, uh, secondary,
*  Jaylen Ramsey looks like shit in that game.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  They've, they put them on an Island and they're, they're just, they just cooked them.
*  Um, the Houston Texans do not deserve to be trusted, but I think we finally might be in
*  a situation where you, you outlined it properly.
*  We're not laying a ton of points.
*  They're at home.
*  It's off the buy.
*  We're dying for a CJ Stroud game.
*  And, you know, we saw a version of Houston at the beginning of the season where Joe
*  Mixon was super effective.
*  We're like, Oh, look at this.
*  You, this Houston team might be a, an 11 or 12 win team.
*  Yeah.
*  Went through their injuries and stuff.
*  Their offensive line is the issue.
*  They can't really be trusted, but I like the spot for Houston.
*  I'm, I'm in your direction on this.
*  You know what I like the most about this game?
*  So if the jets just finished the game last week, that's the game that they gave away
*  and the dolphins lose to the jets last week.
*  What's the line on this game?
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  It's at least three and a half.
*  It might even be four.
*  Yep.
*  So instead we're at two and a half because the jets just decided to actually have like
*  a stroke on the field.
*  They were so stupid.
*  Um, Houston's foreign.
*  Here's another reason to be suspicious to Houston.
*  They're foreign one against the south, a terrible division.
*  They've also beaten the text, the bears, the Patriots and the Cowboys.
*  So this might be the best when they have in a while.
*  Well, let me put this to you because you're, you'll go through the stats and you mentioned
*  this, them coming out fast.
*  They are one of the top five teams in the NFL in terms of scoring in the first half.
*  Yeah.
*  And they don't have to lay very much in the first.
*  I w we can look at the fan dual sports book to see what the first half spread is.
*  Um, they're one of the worst teams.
*  They're one of the worst teams in the NFL in the second half.
*  Yeah.
*  I saw the second half stuff is terrible with them.
*  Right.
*  Um, yeah, I hate doing those first half.
*  You don't, you don't like the exotic.
*  You don't want to split it up.
*  It's minus one and a half.
*  We saved like a point, you know?
*  Okay.
*  All right.
*  Listen, you made me, you did make me think.
*  Do you think two is good?
*  Yes.
*  Yes, I do.
*  I do think it's good.
*  You're in the pro two account.
*  I am a pro two guy.
*  Yes.
*  I just can't get there.
*  Under the rule of thumb, I'm a pro two guy.
*  Under the right circumstances, when he's playing either indoors or in Miami, when
*  it's 80 degrees, I think he's good.
*  And I do think that the DJ has created a playlist for him.
*  He's there spinning some, some, some smooth sounds down there, um, where he
*  can be super effective with those weapons, but like under any kind of adverse conditions,
*  as soon as they go outside, we watched it, forget about it.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, or if he's getting pounded.
*  Right.
*  Okay.
*  Uh, last straight up game, Seahawks Packers, still the stupefying line to me of the week,
*  the lack of respect for Seattle, Pittsburgh and Seattle were the two.
*  I was like, wow, what do, why am I seeing this so differently?
*  Seahawks are plus two and a half at home against the Packers.
*  I just don't get it.
*  The, now that, and you laid out the case on the, uh, gambling pot today, but I don't
*  feel like the defense thing is a mirage.
*  There was real reasons why they started to struggle defensively.
*  All of their guys are back now.
*  They're actually like playing really good defense.
*  McDonald's been there for a while.
*  They understand what he's trying to do.
*  And then the other thing that jumped out, especially last week is that the
*  blocking for their offensive line went from horrific to pretty passable.
*  Like they ran the ball down the throats of Arizona last week, their last four
*  wins that beat San Francisco and the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
*  they won three road games last four weeks at San Francisco, home Arizona,
*  at the jets at Arizona.
*  The other thing I like house, their third, they basically the third best passing
*  attack in the league.
*  And that's been a weakness for green Bay.
*  So I'm trying to think of how green day goes in there and just waltzes and beat
*  them.
*  They would have to be a pretty extraordinary Jordan love game.
*  And I think Seattle's defense can actually contain him.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, you went through those games that they won, including the road games.
*  Those are all high leverage games.
*  Those are all like season determining games.
*  They lose like really any of those.
*  They're probably out of the playoffs and it's a real testament to McDonald.
*  And they did get healthy at the right time.
*  The buy couldn't have come at a better time for them.
*  So since the buy 50%, you know, disruption rate, we saw it against the Cardinals.
*  You love that.
*  One impact I do because top five disruption.
*  That means that they're going in and not letting the offense get itself set into a
*  scheme that, you know, where they can execute what they have in mind.
*  And they're certainly not letting the quarterback get set up.
*  But to me, you mentioned all the offensive side that, you know, they had a zone blocking
*  scheme.
*  We saw Zach Charbonneau look like the guy that, you know, like, Hey, look at him run
*  the ball.
*  That was really effective.
*  It takes so much pressure off of Gino if they can run that way.
*  And look, Gino from a clean pocket, nine touchdowns, two picks.
*  It's like the diametric opposite under pressure, five touchdowns, 10 picks.
*  But the Packers don't generate any pressure.
*  They're 22nd in pressure rate and 26th in pass rush win rate.
*  So pass rush.
*  You do it.
*  You could do it.
*  Well, the last few games, they lost to Detroit twice.
*  They came back and beat the Bears 20 to 19.
*  Eber Fluss is last win.
*  They killed the San Francisco, the game when, which was a good win for them, but also San
*  Francisco had a ton of injuries.
*  And then they beat Miami on that Thursday night.
*  And I like the Packers.
*  I think they're, I think they're a good team, but, but I don't think they should be
*  favored in Seattle.
*  If it was the Seattle from five weeks ago, I get it, but not the Seattle we've watched
*  last month.
*  So to me, that's, I think Seattle should be favored.
*  And the rule is if you, if you feel like you're getting so many more points than you
*  thought you might be getting anyway, there's a couple of things we can do with this.
*  I think Seahawks money line is the play.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Fine.
*  But Seahawks in a teaser is kind of fun.
*  That's one of my favorite legs of the week.
*  Seahawks, Seahawks minus two and a half is plus one 54.
*  Sure.
*  Great.
*  In.
*  So maybe that's the way to play it.
*  Maybe that maybe you play the money line and then put them in a teaser.
*  So teaser possibilities.
*  I'm just insisting on one.
*  The chiefs are minus four and a half against the Browns.
*  So it's, it's more of a money parlay than a teaser, but the chiefs are only minus four
*  and a half in Cleveland.
*  Bad weather.
*  It's the chiefs.
*  Nobody trusts them anymore to cover anything.
*  The Browns are horrible.
*  The Browns should be one.
*  I went through their schedule.
*  The Browns should be one in 12.
*  They're not horrible.
*  The Browns are 30 second in DVOA this year.
*  They're last.
*  They're dead last with DVOA.
*  They're getting more and more injuries every week.
*  Now Greg Newsom is out.
*  They can't run the ball at all.
*  They can't run the ball at all.
*  That's true.
*  And to beat the chiefs, it's just going to have to be Jamis doing stuff every week.
*  Well, you know who we didn't think could run the ball at all?
*  The LA Chargers.
*  Now I'm not going to sit here and say that Justin.
*  You're not going to make the case for the Browns.
*  Are you?
*  I like the Browns.
*  I like the Browns quite a bit.
*  In fact, I think this is the Browns Super Bowl.
*  And I think there's a decent chance to, to, to validate their season.
*  If they have a season where they beat the Ravens, they beat the Steelers and they beat
*  the chiefs.
*  They're terrible.
*  They're not terrible.
*  Their defense is finally...
*  I watched them last week against Pittsburgh.
*  They're terrible.
*  That was, those were short field mistake driven scores.
*  Like they held Russell Wilson to under 160 yards.
*  He didn't have, he didn't have pickets.
*  Short field.
*  I understand.
*  But this, this chiefs situation is busted.
*  And I, I said on one of our shows this week, I can't wait to find the opportunity
*  to fade them in the playoffs because I promise you I'm going to fade them.
*  How about, how about them in Cleveland just to win and beat Jamis Winston in a team?
*  That's missing a kajillion guys.
*  I'm not doing it.
*  I can't endorse it.
*  I think the, the various with Jamis.
*  You've been hanging out with JJ too much.
*  No, I just, I just can't.
*  That secondary for the chiefs is a, has no solution.
*  You, you can't name the like five of the guys that the chargers had on the field catching
*  passes last week.
*  And it just didn't matter.
*  They were all open.
*  They were open every time.
*  It's why the chiefs had to run the Anaconda offense at the end of that game to win.
*  They, they had to strangle the chargers for five minutes and get to a field goal and kick
*  that field goal.
*  It was their only chance to win because the chargers otherwise would have gone down the
*  field and won.
*  Maybe the chargers are good.
*  They could be, but you can't name the guys that were catching balls at tight end or
*  receiver for the chargers.
*  I can name them.
*  Josh Palmer, Quentin Johnson.
*  Those guys think they're so bad.
*  This got hurt.
*  It was so smart.
*  You don't, you don't trust the chiefs.
*  And yet I heard you earlier today talk about how much you like the Cowboys in a fucking
*  tease.
*  Wow.
*  Cowboys are reprehensible.
*  Look, you, you trust the Cowboys to getting eight and a half against the Carolina Panthers.
*  Yes.
*  I just need the chiefs to beat the Browns.
*  They can win by half a point.
*  And I know I hate it.
*  I hate it.
*  You can say that about every team that the chiefs, every bad team that the chiefs have
*  won by the tiniest hair on their ass in each of these last, they're one in seven against
*  the spread.
*  Go ahead.
*  Yeah, I know all those stats, but in a weird way, you're proving my point.
*  The Browns have Jedi.
*  Sustainable.
*  But the Jones have the Browns have Jedi mind trick people into thinking they're not
*  terrible.
*  And they are.
*  They're 30 second in DVO a there.
*  They have a worse DVO a than Carolina, New England, Tennessee, Las Vegas, and the New
*  York Giants worse than everybody.
*  That number has so much to Sean Watson spilled all over it.
*  What about did you see?
*  What did James do last week that you liked other than just sail the ball over people's
*  heads and make terrible plays?
*  They had the back door cover staring them in the face.
*  It was right there.
*  Oh, my God.
*  The other tease I like is the Vikings against the Bears.
*  Just because I'm tired.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, I'm tired of passing on Sam Darnold.
*  Now you're talking.
*  Yeah.
*  And look, you know, if you wanted to go ahead and grab my team and go from seven and a
*  half down to one and a half.
*  Not again.
*  Spencer Rattler.
*  I don't trust your team.
*  Spencer Rattler.
*  I don't trust your team.
*  That the closest margin of I don't trust your 27th quarter defense against the Saints.
*  Just running the ball like 200 times against you makes me nervous.
*  All right.
*  Fine.
*  I don't trust your team.
*  I'm sorry.
*  That's fine.
*  I'm not.
*  I just wanted to put it out there.
*  I'm not going to try to make the case.
*  Vikings minus seven against the Bears.
*  The Vikings weakness is you can kind of throw at them and the Bears are 30th pass.
*  That's a dead man walking team.
*  I am a fourth fourth in sacks.
*  Not to mention all the floor is split stuff.
*  Chicago 32nd.
*  The only case for the Bears is just that they played the Vikings pretty well a month ago.
*  Yep.
*  But now that Darnold, Jefferson, Addison, they're all humming again.
*  Did you see that?
*  There was a long video of Kirk Cousins saying goodbye to everybody in Minnesota after the
*  game.
*  Did you see this?
*  I think I sent this to you.
*  You didn't.
*  But I love the sound of it.
*  I'm dying already.
*  It's a four minute video.
*  All the Vikings, all their players, coaches stuck around in the field to say goodbye to
*  them after the game and his career is over.
*  No, they loved him.
*  They loved him so much that it was just guy after guy coming over, hugging him.
*  Hey, man, it's great to see you.
*  He just seems like he was the most beloved teammate ever.
*  He's a gamer.
*  I mean, people love Kirk Cousins.
*  Two hundred million dollars by being a gamer.
*  Not very good, but a gamer.
*  So you're down on Vikings minus seven.
*  Oh, a hundred percent down.
*  And what if I talked you into Casey money, Minnesota money, anything with Kansas City?
*  I'm telling you, Casey money, Minnesota money, Seattle plus eight and a half is plus 150.
*  You can do that on your own.
*  I'm not endorsing anything with you.
*  Really?
*  That about I'm not mad.
*  I what is it about the ringer gambling show that the shitty teams and the bad quarterbacks
*  are like fucking catnip for you guys?
*  I don't get it.
*  I laid three and a half points with the chiefs on Sunday night and they showed flaws that are
*  unlike I grew out of them.
*  Yeah.
*  So I'm not I'm out on them.
*  They are super beatable.
*  They keep telling us who they are every single week.
*  They get down to a single moment, a single score, and they've been on the correct side
*  of the outcome.
*  I'm not betting on that.
*  I'm not betting on that anymore.
*  I'm done with the chiefs.
*  So there's a Minnesota tease possibility with Seattle.
*  Okay.
*  In I still like that Seattle minus two Seattle minus two and a half plus 154.
*  Great.
*  Love it.
*  No argument.
*  I think that defense is super legit.
*  Like Green Bay in Detroit got a version of a Detroit defense.
*  We were like, oh, Detroit, they're really banged up.
*  This is going to be a hard spot for them.
*  And they were gamers.
*  It wasn't that Green Bay went out and flew all over them.
*  But this Seattle defense is a different deal and we're outdoors.
*  Now, I respect Green Bay's outdoor acumen.
*  I'm not suggesting that they're going to have a problem playing outdoors.
*  It's just a different kind of situation, different speed.
*  All right.
*  I think I know what we want to do for million dollar picks.
*  All right.
*  It's time million dollar picks.
*  Week 15.
*  We are staying away from Niners Rams tonight.
*  As much as we usually like throwing a little something on the Thursday night,
*  if we can get the pot up in time to me, it's just an abject stay away Rams Niners.
*  Staying away.
*  So apologies to both of those teams.
*  We did not want to wage on you tonight.
*  Here's what we do want to do.
*  And we're up 1.764 million dollars.
*  We won 551,000 dollars last week house.
*  Pretty good.
*  First one, Steelers.
*  We looked at this all different ways.
*  We thought about money line with the under.
*  We thought about Steelers plus four and a half on Fandels even on it's like
*  all kinds of machinations.
*  Both of us feel like this line is two to two and a half points too high
*  because the Steelers defense, how good it is such a good defense.
*  Don't trust the Eagles passing offense.
*  Do not love Mike Tomlin as an underdog.
*  Love the most underappreciated discounted team of 2024.
*  The Pittsburgh Steelers plus five and a half in Philly.
*  We were putting $200,000 on that one, even though George don't call me.
*  Carl Pickens is not playing.
*  So there you go.
*  That's our first one.
*  Second one lions minus two and a half at home against Josh Allen and the bills.
*  This is a straight backing of the lions offense.
*  We are going in eyes wide open.
*  Could be a fun live head, live hedge house near the end.
*  Yeah.
*  Bills down 14 late.
*  Just jump on Josh.
*  Try to middle it.
*  You have to get Sean McDermott out of there, but yes.
*  Who's your, who do you think is the best team right now?
*  Just in general, is it still the lions for you?
*  But Detroit, yes, Detroit.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah, that's how I feel.
*  All right.
*  Well, we get them under a field goal at home in a big game.
*  Great.
*  And by the way, the bills don't necessarily need the game.
*  They're either going to be the two seed or the three seed, unless
*  Casey loses in Cleveland this week.
*  If you missed the first part of the pod house, would it let me put Casey in a teaser parlay?
*  Even though Cleveland's 32nd DVO a Cleveland sucks.
*  They're terrible.
*  I don't think they seem like a layup and house through his body in front of it.
*  So I get to just send him MF or Texas if Casey's up by 20.
*  Next bet.
*  Texans minus two and a half at home against the Miami dolphins who came very close to
*  losing Aaron Rodgers who gave up a 300 point game or three hundred yard game.
*  Aaron Rodgers, which she got kicked out of the league at this point.
*  Texans minus two and a half coming off a bye.
*  Still no all around.
*  Yeah, we have to see whether Toronto Armstead's even able to go for Miami
*  overtime game for Miami.
*  All those extra plays Houston off the by rested and really ready to put their stamp on the
*  back half of this season.
*  They have a really tough schedule.
*  They have to win a home game like this.
*  We are banking on this being a hey, CJ Stroud, welcome back to the season game combined with
*  if the Jets had just take care of business being the dolphins last week, there's no way
*  this line would be minus two and a half.
*  And we're grabbing Houston 200 can that no one putting a little a little teaser
*  with Minnesota and Seattle.
*  Minnesota's minus seven.
*  Seattle is plus two and a half at home against Green Bay.
*  So we'll we'll nudge that up six points.
*  We're putting 200 K on that.
*  We don't understand the Seattle line at all.
*  Minnesota at home against Chicago.
*  We believe in this Minnesota team still lingering, still hoping the Lions stumble and
*  they can just hop up and grab the one seed.
*  Sam Darnham, would you take them on the on the commanders and have Daniels?
*  I think he would.
*  Oh, if we didn't have Daniels, sure.
*  He would be immediately be one of the best quarterbacks the past 25 years in Washington.
*  I would take them on the paths if we didn't have Drake made the future of the NFL on our team.
*  I like them.
*  It's a great bounce back season.
*  And then we're going to do a little 50 K parlay of the Pittsburgh money line
*  combined with the Seahawks minus two and a half on Fandall, which is plus 142.
*  You put those two together.
*  Plus 638.
*  That's juicy.
*  Pittsburgh money line Seahawks minus two and a half.
*  We're going to put 50 K on that.
*  I really was trying to figure out a way to work.
*  Drake made a million dollar picks in Arizona because I think they actually may be dumb
*  enough to beat Arizona this week, but we'll stay away.
*  We don't need it.
*  Good job.
*  Those are the million dollar picks for week 15.
*  House, we can see you on the Ringer Sunday pregame shot.
*  Might be stopping by.
*  Can't wait.
*  Look, have you thought about who's your underdog pick?
*  Is it just going to be Pittsburgh?
*  Right?
*  It might be.
*  I mean, one of the other guys might jump ahead of me, but there's a lot of great choices,
*  including the Cleveland Browns.
*  I hope you're dumb enough to take them.
*  We'll see.
*  You know who I was looking at as a possible underdog?
*  I would embed it, but just for if you're forced to take an underdog for that segment,
*  the Riddler and the Raiders.
*  Going against Atlanta in Vegas.
*  It's a feeling the Raiders have one more dumb win in them.
*  It's the funniest outcome for sure.
*  It would, it would be hilarious.
*  And I do think, you know, the guys, the defense for the Raiders, um, will, will be playing
*  because they know they're really auditioning for the next head coach of the Raiders.
*  They're not playing for that guy any longer.
*  Yeah.
*  I thought that one jumped out to me.
*  Seahawks are somehow underdog.
*  I'm sure JJ will take them.
*  I don't mind that Pat says an underdog pick though.
*  Anyway, house.
*  Great to see you enjoy the NBA cup this weekend.
*  I will see you next week.
