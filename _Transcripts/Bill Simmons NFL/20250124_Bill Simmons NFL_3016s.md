*  You've drinking the colonoscopy juice. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=10.64s)]
*  There's been fireworks in the house house. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=13.06s)]
*  This is the most action packed million dollar picks we've ever had. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=15.06s)]
*  Your team might make the super bowl. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=17.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=19.48s)]
*  I mean, first of all, you see all this gear. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=20.56s)]
*  What I have on what's behind me. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=23.28s)]
*  You're going to see none of that when I'm in Philadelphia this weekend. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=24.900000000000002s)]
*  This is the last time you're going to see any of this stuff because I am not [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=28.02s)]
*  catching any hands when I'm up there. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=31.44s)]
*  I'm not, I'm not looking for it, right? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=33.46s)]
*  I'm not, I'm too old. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=35.14s)]
*  We're too old to wear the visiting teams member merchandise. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=36.22s)]
*  We can't do it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=41.18s)]
*  Definitely not. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=42.1s)]
*  You gotta go. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=42.620000000000005s)]
*  You support the team silently and hope you don't get punched. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=43.82s)]
*  Also, if you do get in a fight in the stands though, make sure it's, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=48.1s)]
*  it's to somebody who's below you. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=51.260000000000005s)]
*  This is the Priscilla technique. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=52.78s)]
*  Great. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=54.62s)]
*  Guy in the higher ground always wins in the, in the football things. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=54.9s)]
*  Anyway, don't punch house. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=58.339999999999996s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=59.42s)]
*  Not to get punched. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=61.3s)]
*  I mean, if beers get poured on me, that's fine. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=62.18s)]
*  I I'll, I'll go with that, but I will tell you on the subject of, of the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=64.22s)]
*  procedure of my screening procedure, this, this, you know, health path that we're on. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=68.46s)]
*  You, you, you can tell how unimaginable it was that, that I would have something [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=73.94s)]
*  football related in my life this weekend. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=79.94s)]
*  I mean, I scheduled the colonoscopy months ago, right? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=82.54s)]
*  Because I look at the calendar like, oh, sure. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=85.7s)]
*  It's it's it's conference championship weekend. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=88.06s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=91.7s)]
*  I mean, I'll be playing conference championship. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=92.62s)]
*  But this turned out to be the dance night or colonoscopy. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=95.34s)]
*  You're you're releasing off the dance night or feces toxins out of your body. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=98.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=103.26s)]
*  It's symbolic. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=103.62s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=104.34s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=104.86000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it really is. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=105.38000000000001s)]
*  All of it's coming out. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=106.38000000000001s)]
*  I can tell you that much. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=107.42s)]
*  In fact, if I, we might have to take a break, uh, 10 minutes in here. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=108.46000000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=112.14000000000001s)]
*  Well, the listeners slash viewers will never know. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=112.54s)]
*  We'll just do a nice clean edit and you can come back with a nice happy look on [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=115.82000000000001s)]
*  your face. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=119.42s)]
*  As clean as my colon, hopefully. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=119.9s)]
*  Uh, we didn't do well, a million dollar picks last week. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=122.02000000000001s)]
*  We lost $585,000, but we were still up $1.282 million for the year. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=125.22s)]
*  I'm okay with what happened last week. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=130.62s)]
*  I would take Baltimore again and your team. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=132.34s)]
*  We kind of had to see it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=135.78s)]
*  I wish I took last in. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=138.26s)]
*  I didn't have the balls. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=139.58s)]
*  I just did it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=140.70000000000002s)]
*  I didn't have the balls to take a rookie QB against a team that felt like they [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=141.42s)]
*  were going to run all over you, which they basically did, but it didn't matter [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=145.57999999999998s)]
*  because they turned the ball over five times. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=148.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=150.22s)]
*  Turnovers are the story of this last round. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=151.17999999999998s)]
*  There's so many, there might even be turnover in your pants. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=153.66s)]
*  Um, there's so many stories this week about turnover battle, like the bills, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=156.73999999999998s)]
*  21 straight games where they haven't lost the turnover battle. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=161.1s)]
*  Like has never since 1960. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=164.1s)]
*  Um, that there's all these good metrics for if you, if, if you look like this [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=166.38s)]
*  Bill's team, just with turnovers, you end up winning the super bowl chiefs, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=171.18s)]
*  haven't turned the ball over in two months this round, the last four teams, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=174.86s)]
*  none of them have a turnover. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=179.22s)]
*  And I just wish, I wish I wasn't saying it this way, but it's almost as reductive [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=181.3s)]
*  as at least with the chiefs bills game, whoever doesn't turn the ball over [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=186.54000000000002s)]
*  is probably going to win. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=190.02s)]
*  I feel stupid saying it, but I think it's true. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=192.26s)]
*  Well, the two aspects of it for sure that all four of these teams have an advantage [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=194.74s)]
*  is, is taking sacks. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=199.1s)]
*  These quarterbacks not taking sacks and these teams, you know, being on the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=200.82s)]
*  correct side of the turnover margin, both Washington and Philadelphia arrived for [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=204.82s)]
*  their matchup plus six, the exact same number through these playoffs. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=209.94s)]
*  Uh, and nobody would have forecasted this for Washington. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=214.34s)]
*  I don't, I don't think, I mean, that's what's truly remarkable. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=217.94s)]
*  And, and for sure, I think the handicap that we now, by the time on Sunday, on [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=220.86s)]
*  the ringer pregame show in advance of the, the YouTube TV, yes, indeed. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=225.70000000000002s)]
*  I thought that nine and a half points. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=231.34s)]
*  I finally was, had the balls to say it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=234.3s)]
*  The Detroit favor by nine and a half was goddamn disrespectful. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=236.74s)]
*  You didn't have the ball to say it when we did million dollar picks. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=240.3s)]
*  Oh, good. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=243.18s)]
*  I couldn't remember. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=243.66000000000003s)]
*  No, I did not. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=244.98000000000002s)]
*  No, you were like, you were teased. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=246.18s)]
*  We were being cute. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=248.7s)]
*  Hey, you're being cute. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=250.17999999999998s)]
*  You're being cute about it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=251.22s)]
*  I think you deep down knew your team had a real chance. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=252.5s)]
*  Um, I'm a little annoyed. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=255.5s)]
*  Five little nine. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=257.86s)]
*  Let's go backwards. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=259.97999999999996s)]
*  Cause you haven't been on the pod since Washington wins this game. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=260.98s)]
*  Top five sports moment of your life. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=265.09999999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=267.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=268.82s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=269.34s)]
*  Unquestionably. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=269.7s)]
*  I would say unquestionably because of how far we've come, how unexpected it was. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=270.94s)]
*  I mean, I feel now like it's a bad, um, analogy coming on here every single week [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=277.34s)]
*  and saying to you that if we wrote this script out, if you wrote real life as [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=284.74s)]
*  it's occurring and said, this is a script about a football team, every production [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=290.7s)]
*  house would turn it down, say, this is, this is trash. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=295.94s)]
*  Like a sports movie. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=298.9s)]
*  They dumped their terrible owner who hated the fans who almost like ruined [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=299.9s)]
*  football in an entire city that loved football. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=303.94s)]
*  And then the new guy comes in, new coach, new GM, new QB, and they just go on a [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=306.14s)]
*  winning streak. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=312.14s)]
*  Well, not just new QB, possibly the greatest rookie in the history of the football game. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=313.02s)]
*  I mean, there was a few of those stories this week. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=317.73999999999995s)]
*  I mean, we were there for Marina. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=320.82s)]
*  Marina was pretty great. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=323.06s)]
*  Now, granted, we, you know, we only got to see him a couple of times, but yeah, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=324.21999999999997s)]
*  with the Daniels, the playoff wins to it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=327.85999999999996s)]
*  Pretty nuts. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=330.97999999999996s)]
*  There's a lot to cover with this game. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=331.74s)]
*  The Washington piece, I can't shake. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=336.90000000000003s)]
*  There's some 2001 Pats Parallels. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=339.54s)]
*  And watching your excitement with this, the Pats, they were like five and five [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=342.54s)]
*  after 10 games and then they didn't lose again. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=346.94s)]
*  And at some point, weird shit started happening, leading to the snow game, which [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=349.94s)]
*  was like, that was when they finally pulled us in and none of the Pats fans wanted [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=354.26s)]
*  to believe and say, no, no, believe. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=358.5s)]
*  We had like weird Brady Bledsoe stuff, but you know, Bledsoe got hurt. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=360.3s)]
*  It was an up and down season. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=364.42s)]
*  Uh, we had that with the defense and the coaching. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=366.18s)]
*  You have it with your offense, but you guys are 14 and five. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=368.46000000000004s)]
*  He has won eight straight games. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=373.62s)]
*  It's not like, they're like, oh my God, what's Washington doing here? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=375.06s)]
*  Like at some point Washington's just good. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=377.94s)]
*  And I, I'm really leaning toward taking them in the game, not just [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=380.78000000000003s)]
*  with the points, but outright. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=384.82s)]
*  I really think they can win and we'll get into the Philly stuff in a second. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=387.06s)]
*  But let's just get that out of the way. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=390.14s)]
*  I don't think this is fluky. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=392.62s)]
*  I think that Daniel's has been that good. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=394.06s)]
*  The coaching has been that good. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=396.09999999999997s)]
*  The guys over and over again, you've had like these semi miraculous wins, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=397.7s)]
*  these comeback wins, these fourth quarter wins, and there's a mojo that develops [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=402.02s)]
*  that I think divides the magicians. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=407.06s)]
*  I picked against Washington the last two rounds. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=409.14s)]
*  Understandable. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=412.18s)]
*  I'm tired of doing it. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=412.97999999999996s)]
*  Like at some point you got to accept what's going on and something is going on. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=414.21999999999997s)]
*  It does feel like something is going on. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=418.42s)]
*  I mean, I can't view it, uh, from my unbi in an unbiased kind of, of way. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=420.26s)]
*  And for sure the sum of all of these guys together believing is greater than the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=426.42s)]
*  parts because you can't sit down and do X's and O's, you can't do advanced metrics. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=434.1s)]
*  You can't use any of those things to truly capture the spirit of this team [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=439.42s)]
*  and the way these guys believe. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=445.3s)]
*  And they just believe in that belief in each other. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=447.26s)]
*  I mean, it's an incredible combination of veterans and rookies and the veterans, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=450.42s)]
*  some guys that have been there before Bobby Wagner has been there before. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=456.22s)]
*  So for a defense that by all metrics, it's the worst unit on the football field [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=459.62s)]
*  come Sunday, but somehow or another, we keep getting W's. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=464.06s)]
*  They just keep getting W's Bill Simmons. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=468.58000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, you have, it's like the 30th defense DVOA against the run. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=471.21999999999997s)]
*  Your defense is basically what the 01 Pat's offense was every week. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=476.58s)]
*  We're like, how are we going to score points? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=480.18s)]
*  Like we have Jermaine Wiggins as a tight end. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=481.86s)]
*  We are only good offensive player is Troy Brown. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=484.78s)]
*  We have a rookie QB who they're terrified to have him really do anything. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=487.54s)]
*  And each week we would just patch together points and the same thing's [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=491.86s)]
*  happening with your defense where it's like, how is this defense going to stop [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=495.7s)]
*  anybody and you're just getting turnovers? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=499.9s)]
*  But the thing is, it was like Detroit. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=501.78s)]
*  Yeah, they had five turnovers. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=503.29999999999995s)]
*  There were some bad plays. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=504.46s)]
*  Washington also made some good plays. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=506.17999999999995s)]
*  Like that guy, that guy jumping the post route on the TD in the end zone. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=507.97999999999996s)]
*  That was a good fucking play. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=512.38s)]
*  Outstanding. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=513.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=514.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=515.02s)]
*  But the rookie Mike Sanders still had two interceptions. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=515.26s)]
*  And I feel very proud of myself. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=519.42s)]
*  And one of my threads with, with actually a guy with the, with the team, I said, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=520.9399999999999s)]
*  you know, this is part of the, the, the revelation. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=525.9s)]
*  This guy, Sanra still the kid from Michigan. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=528.06s)]
*  He's been unbelievable, but you know, it's a, he is for sure benefiting from [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=530.5799999999999s)]
*  the overall gravitas of, of, of this defense. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=536.54s)]
*  Dan Quinn can coach up a defense. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=540.5799999999999s)]
*  He's got the spine. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=542.78s)]
*  You have Jeremy Chin playing safety. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=543.9s)]
*  You've got Frankie Louvue and Bobby Wagner where they are. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=545.6199999999999s)]
*  And it does, they just, they just really do believe in look, they held Tampa to [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=548.9799999999999s)]
*  20 points and we watched that Tampa defense. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=555.3399999999999s)]
*  I mean, offense go out and just post points on everybody. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=557.9399999999999s)]
*  Now it did feel like if Detroit had stuck with the run, that they might've been able [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=560.98s)]
*  to run for 250 yards in the second half and they might've won that football game, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=565.78s)]
*  but they chose not to. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=569.62s)]
*  And that kid who had at least some role in it is now going to be the head [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=571.26s)]
*  coach of the Chicago Bears. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=576.22s)]
*  So good luck to them. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=577.5799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=579.06s)]
*  He got to stay in your conference. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=579.26s)]
*  Their conference. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=581.42s)]
*  Well, you're, you're the Washington conference, the bears, Ben [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=583.38s)]
*  Johnson, get to, get to play them. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=587.46s)]
*  Um, the Washington piece of this big picture, if they could actually win this [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=590.74s)]
*  game, where did the Eagles rank on most hated Washington opponents? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=597.1s)]
*  They're not number one, but they're in the top three, right? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=600.4200000000001s)]
*  Well, because we hate everybody in the NFC East. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=602.7800000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=606.7s)]
*  Hate Dallas the most for sure. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=607.1s)]
*  It's mutual hatred amongst all of the franchises in the NFC East and each [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=608.58s)]
*  team has their own, which one they hate the most. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=612.7s)]
*  I think the giants hate the Eagles the most. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=615.46s)]
*  Uh, I think the Eagles hate Dallas the most. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=617.9000000000001s)]
*  Uh, I don't know, but, um, for sure Washington hates Dallas the most [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=622.0600000000001s)]
*  Philadelphia. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=627.1800000000001s)]
*  Let's, you know, be real about it. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=628.58s)]
*  Wasn't really on the radar for a long time. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=630.46s)]
*  Well, you've only played them once in the playoffs. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=632.62s)]
*  It's, it's like the weirdest rivalry. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=634.74s)]
*  That's not actually a rivalry. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=636.7800000000001s)]
*  It felt like the last couple of years, it was more fun cause you guys would [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=638.14s)]
*  have some good games. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=641.0600000000001s)]
*  You beat them last year. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=641.7800000000001s)]
*  What does it make? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=643.4200000000001s)]
*  I mean, I'm not that surprised that Washington and Philadelphia have only [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=644.3s)]
*  faced each other in the playoffs once. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=647.54s)]
*  Cause that means both teams have to make it in and, and, you know, in [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=649.02s)]
*  their previous iteration. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=652.2199999999999s)]
*  Well, when you think they've been playing football for 80 years, one time [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=653.9399999999999s)]
*  seems low. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=657.3399999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=658.9s)]
*  Sure. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=659.26s)]
*  And Daniels is the most popular Washington athlete since I've known you. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=660.38s)]
*  It's either him or Renupal. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=665.02s)]
*  It's either him or George Mearson. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=668.4599999999999s)]
*  I mean, you know, you're, you're all time greats or John Riggins. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=670.3399999999999s)]
*  And, uh, you know, there are several generations of, of Washington fans that [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=673.74s)]
*  didn't have football in their lives. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=680.22s)]
*  So Alex Ovechkin ranks pretty high up in terms of Washington icons. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=682.14s)]
*  Uh, yeah, but Daniels is in the conversation. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=687.54s)]
*  Let there be no doubt. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=691.22s)]
*  Some old heads like me, like Wes Onseld and Elvin Hayes, but you know, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=692.46s)]
*  that's old head shit. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=695.9s)]
*  Finishing last, Andre Blatch. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=697.42s)]
*  Um, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=699.82s)]
*  all right. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=700.26s)]
*  So to get to the point where I want to have the balls to take Washington, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=702.7s)]
*  no, N'Kobe Dean. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=707.3s)]
*  That's good. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=708.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=709.42s)]
*  Here's the big thing. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=711.38s)]
*  Do your thing about how you think Hertz has hurt. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=714.18s)]
*  Cause this is, this is the number one reason to take Washington is there is [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=716.78s)]
*  something wrong with Jalen Hertz. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=720.38s)]
*  The stats back it up, the eye test back it up and his knee got bent backwards [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=721.78s)]
*  during the game and they've been tightlipped about it. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=725.22s)]
*  I don't think they'd tell us if he was hurt, but do your thing. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=727.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=729.6999999999999s)]
*  And, and, uh, we, we watched it. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=730.02s)]
*  It was a bad stretch and it was bad enough that we wondered, I wandered in [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=732.54s)]
*  the moment, whether that was a tear, whether that was a ligament tear or [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=738.22s)]
*  turned out it clearly was not a ligament tear because that would have been [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=741.86s)]
*  announced on, on Monday, but the discussion all week has been, we presume [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=745.06s)]
*  that Jalen Hertz is going to play. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=752.66s)]
*  We expect Jalen Hertz to, to play. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=754.38s)]
*  I mean, we watched the way that that knee bent and they definitely shot him up [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=756.98s)]
*  with something because his behavior in the interview after that game, when he [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=761.78s)]
*  was with a, say quad that was a version of Jalen Hertz that is not your, your [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=766.5799999999999s)]
*  sort of standard issue post game, you know, he's, he's, he, he had a kind of, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=771.62s)]
*  uh, aura, let's just put it at that. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=778.06s)]
*  Um, but look, if Washington only has to stop Saquon Barkley, preposterous kind [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=781.38s)]
*  of task that's in front of them. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=791.22s)]
*  If Jalen Hertz isn't going to throw the football down the field, it takes him too [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=794.3000000000001s)]
*  long. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=797.3000000000001s)]
*  We've been watching this now and I know you have the stats to back it up where [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=797.58s)]
*  for throws that are 10 yards or longer down the football field, it's just taken [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=801.0600000000001s)]
*  too long for him to get the ball out of the head and out of his hand and they're [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=804.66s)]
*  not throwing the ball anyway. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=807.46s)]
*  And he's taken sacks, which he didn't take before. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=809.1s)]
*  Like there was a great Twitter thread of all the worst plays he had in that last [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=811.5s)]
*  game. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=816.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=816.78s)]
*  And it was just video after video and it was like, Jesus, he looks like freaking [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=817.06s)]
*  Dorian Thompson Robinson. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=821.18s)]
*  Like what's this dude doing? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=822.5799999999999s)]
*  Um, you know, I really thought long and hard about the matchup because my instinct [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=824.26s)]
*  was take Washington and I didn't have a good week last week and I wanted to, I [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=830.86s)]
*  kept coming back to the total yardage, which I sent to you. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=834.94s)]
*  There was a most rushing yards ever in the NFC championship game, the NFC [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=838.46s)]
*  championship game. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=842.2600000000001s)]
*  The case for the Eagles, which I'm not against, is that they're going to run the [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=843.5400000000001s)]
*  ball down Washington's throat. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=846.34s)]
*  They're going to control the game and they're just going to have the ball time. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=848.3000000000001s)]
*  You're only going to get like six possessions, one bad thing. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=851.6600000000001s)]
*  You won't get a fourth and two. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=854.1800000000001s)]
*  Maybe there's a tip pass turnover and all of a sudden the Eagles are up 10 and [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=855.94s)]
*  they went. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=859.22s)]
*  The thing that's interesting to me is how few times in the title game, a team has [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=860.4200000000001s)]
*  just run the ball down somebody else's throat. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=865.7800000000001s)]
*  And I, I sent this to you just in the last 40 plus years, only one team in the [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=868.34s)]
*  NFC title game has gotten a 200 plus yards rushing. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=876.38s)]
*  That was the Niners against the Packers in 2020. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=879.1800000000001s)]
*  Other than that, we're talking 81 Eagles, 71 Cowboys, 80 Rams, 73 Vikings, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=882.3000000000001s)]
*  97 Packers. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=889.02s)]
*  And then you get into that 169 to 196 range and there's some more modern teams [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=890.86s)]
*  there, the Lions last year, the Seahawks in January, 2015, the Bears. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=895.9s)]
*  And, but my point is it's unusual. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=902.3399999999999s)]
*  Like really, really historically unusual to rush for 200 plus in this second [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=905.9399999999999s)]
*  to last game of the season. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=911.1s)]
*  So my question to you is how many yards are the Eagles going to have in this game [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=912.86s)]
*  when you factor in Hertz is throwing for 130 to 150 yards a game that puts them [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=917.66s)]
*  in like the low three hundreds, which you get every week. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=924.1s)]
*  And the crucial thing for what you just shared in terms of Philly's approach is [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=927.66s)]
*  if Jalen Hertz can't run, go ahead and set Saquon Barclays over under at 199 and a [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=935.9s)]
*  half yards. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=942.94s)]
*  If Washington can hold them under 200. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=944.26s)]
*  I like Washington's chances. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=946.66s)]
*  But 200 would be the, that would be one of the two best performances of the last 45 [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=948.3399999999999s)]
*  years. How about like, set it at 150. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=953.2199999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=956.02s)]
*  I don't, it's Saquon. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=957.02s)]
*  He's been unbelievable. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=958.06s)]
*  I mean, he rips off 70 yard runs. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=959.0999999999999s)]
*  But to me, the larger point is if Jalen, if that dimension of Jalen Hertz is not on [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=961.66s)]
*  the table and we'll know within the first, you know, series, we'll see how he [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=967.18s)]
*  moves. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=970.8199999999999s)]
*  If he is not a threat to run the football down, down the field, then that changes [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=972.22s)]
*  things immensely. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=977.46s)]
*  And, you know, I Washington, right. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=979.42s)]
*  Like that, that long touchdown run he had in the first quarter last. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=981.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=983.9s)]
*  Take that away. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=984.5s)]
*  If that threat isn't there, then it changes things. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=985.58s)]
*  It tilts things for the Washington defense. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=988.86s)]
*  In the AFC title game, nobody ever, no team has ever rushed for 200 plus yards. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=991.18s)]
*  The last team in the last, like the 99 Broncos rushed for 178. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=996.54s)]
*  It makes sense. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1004.02s)]
*  The 2015 Pats ran for 177. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1004.86s)]
*  So it's just, it's important to remember that, oh, Saquon's going to run all over [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1008.1s)]
*  them. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1012.58s)]
*  Well, when we get to the final four, that's usually not happening in the way you [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1012.78s)]
*  think it's going to happen. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1016.1s)]
*  And then if Hertz is going to look throwing the ball like he has the last few [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1017.62s)]
*  weeks and really like the whole season, I haven't really liked watching them all [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1020.7s)]
*  season. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1024.7s)]
*  And, you know, it seems like you look at the stats and the advanced stats for him [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1025.22s)]
*  the last three years, it's not that far off, but then like the bundle wrote a [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1029.02s)]
*  great piece for the ringer today about the Eagles passing game. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1032.7s)]
*  And it's like, they basically just kind of punted on it and maybe try to take two [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1035.38s)]
*  shots a game, but other than a couple of Dallas Goddard plays, but for the most [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1041.3400000000001s)]
*  part, they're just trying to run the ball and control the clock. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1045.98s)]
*  The question for me though, if you can hang around what we saw from the Eagles [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1049.06s)]
*  in that fourth quarter against the Rams, where all the, it just felt like the [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1053.7s)]
*  front four died. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1056.6200000000001s)]
*  They started to get tired and the Rams are just moving the ball down the field [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1058.22s)]
*  on them. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1061.7s)]
*  Their receivers are getting open. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1061.98s)]
*  That's what Daniel, that's, that's what he does. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1063.1000000000001s)]
*  Well, and here's the thing, Washington from the minute that they get the ball [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1065.5s)]
*  in the first quarter is going to be playing no huddle up tempo offense. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1070.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1075.7s)]
*  And that was- [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1076.02s)]
*  Four down offense too. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1076.42s)]
*  Any fourth and two, fourth, three they're going for. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1077.66s)]
*  Going for every single one of those. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1079.7s)]
*  Every series that Washington possesses the ball will be a four down series in the [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1081.46s)]
*  sense that they're going to try if they're close at all and they're not on the wrong [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1086.3400000000001s)]
*  side of like, you know, the, the, their own 30 yard line that they'll go for it. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1090.42s)]
*  I, I'm, and, and, you know, at some point, the cumulative effect of that on a [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1095.18s)]
*  defense, this is why, like the Jalen Carter piece is significant and Washington [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1099.8600000000001s)]
*  loss- [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1104.5400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, make his ass tired. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1104.8200000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1106.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1107.2600000000002s)]
*  We just watched it. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1107.46s)]
*  We lost Sam Cosme now, you know, Washington and its own shrewd way is being coy about, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1108.98s)]
*  you know, how they're going to play this. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1115.3000000000002s)]
*  And there is a thought that Andrew Wiley might slide from the left side over to [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1116.74s)]
*  the right side and he has played some right guard for Kansas City, but it was [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1120.26s)]
*  several years ago and you know, they, they have talent on this offensive line, but [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1125.8600000000001s)]
*  really it's, it's a Kingsbury scheme thing that's been most impressive. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1130.9s)]
*  So it's a huge loss to lose Cosme. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1135.22s)]
*  But the Jalen Carter piece, yeah, man, he got tired. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1137.7s)]
*  He would, he made the play of the game. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1140.3s)]
*  I would say on a really bad play call, uh, McVeigh said that there was a miscommunication. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1142.74s)]
*  Um, and that, that, that led to, you know, right. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1147.8600000000001s)]
*  I always watch for that with the, from a live bet standpoint, these teams that [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1151.22s)]
*  have these awesome pass rushes, the first two hours of the game in that fourth [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1155.38s)]
*  quarter, it gets a little different once the guys have been out there for three [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1158.94s)]
*  hours. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1162.18s)]
*  Well, you know, another time we saw it, the last time Washington played [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1163.02s)]
*  Philadelphia when Washington came back from down to score 36 points. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1166.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1171.18s)]
*  The most points anybody scored on this Philadelphia defense all season. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1171.5s)]
*  So McShea and I talked earlier about how there's like been three Washington [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1175.06s)]
*  seasons, basically you had that first stretch in the beginning when it was [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1178.98s)]
*  like, Oh my God, what's going on? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1181.66s)]
*  Daniel's got hurt. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1183.78s)]
*  You had some injuries, Eckor got hurt. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1186.3s)]
*  Like it's just, you didn't, and then all of a sudden you had your full team again [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1188.22s)]
*  and it came on, but you go back to that. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1191.1399999999999s)]
*  You lost to Philly in week 11. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1192.8999999999999s)]
*  And from that point on Dallas week 12, you put up 412 yards, Tennessee, 463 [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1194.42s)]
*  saints, 326 Eagles and week 16, 368 Atlanta week 17, 412 week 18 against Dallas [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1201.26s)]
*  throughout, because that wasn't Marietta. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1210.14s)]
*  It was a Marietta. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1212.22s)]
*  Tampa wild card, 350. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1213.98s)]
*  And then last week, Detroit, 41. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1216.02s)]
*  So if you're taking a team on the road, I want to, I want to make sure that [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1219.3400000000001s)]
*  they can move the ball and everyone's like this Eagles defense. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1224.34s)]
*  It's really good. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1227.1799999999998s)]
*  It's the best defense in the league, but I think Washington can move the ball [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1227.98s)]
*  on him because we've seen them do it. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1230.62s)]
*  And then the question is how special is Daniel's and that becomes the [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1233.1799999999998s)]
*  narrative out of this. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1236.4599999999998s)]
*  Can, can he get there? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1237.6599999999999s)]
*  There's a couple of playoff manifesto rules in play rule number three, but [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1239.4599999999998s)]
*  where the nobody believes in us team, but don't try to talk yourself into one either. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1243.82s)]
*  I'm not sure they qualify anymore because it seems like this week there's [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1247.22s)]
*  some good discourse about people believing in them. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1249.8999999999999s)]
*  Last week, definitely nobody believed in them. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1252.98s)]
*  The funny thing is that, uh, I feel like, you know, from the sort of national [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1255.7s)]
*  NFL media perspective, there's a lot of believers in Washington, but the market [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1260.3s)]
*  does not believe in Washington because this line opened at four and a half and [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1264.8600000000001s)]
*  it got slammed all the way up to its present six and a half spot. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1267.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1271.18s)]
*  And I think the general consensus is. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1271.38s)]
*  Eagles are going to run all over them. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1274.46s)]
*  Their defense will shut them down. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1275.9s)]
*  And this was a nice congratulations, Washington for making the NFC title game, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1277.26s)]
*  but it's time to go home. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1280.74s)]
*  Rule number six, never pick an underdog unless you genuinely [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1281.58s)]
*  believe that as a chance to win. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1284.62s)]
*  I believe, I think it's, I honestly think either, I think either team could win. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1287.6599999999999s)]
*  So with the plus six and a half, I think they could win. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1292.4199999999998s)]
*  I don't know if they're going to win. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1296.34s)]
*  I think they're going to win. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1298.26s)]
*  Rule number 14 was aware of any team that reminds you of the 2007 giants. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1299.6999999999998s)]
*  I'm going to add the 2001 paths to this list. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1304.26s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1306.6999999999998s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1307.4199999999998s)]
*  I think there's something that happens in the game. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1307.74s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1310.1s)]
*  I think there's something that happens with teams that get thrown together over [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1310.46s)]
*  the course of a season when they can get hot like this and some funky stuff [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1313.6200000000001s)]
*  happened, but when you think about. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1317.3s)]
*  You go backwards and think about the five, the four and a half months with [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1318.98s)]
*  Washington and the hail Mary and some of these games you pulled out of your ass. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1321.9s)]
*  At some point you develop like these winning scars almost. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1327.42s)]
*  I agree with this. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1332.58s)]
*  So if they're, if they're hanging around in the fourth quarter and they're down [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1333.26s)]
*  three, I'm just, I'm going to be mad if I bet on Philly. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1336.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1339.58s)]
*  Uh, go ahead. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1340.78s)]
*  Do you have any more manifesto things? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1342.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1343.62s)]
*  Rule number 16, take one last look at the quarterbacks. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1343.86s)]
*  Remember there's plenty of time to bet against any QB or coach. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1347.18s)]
*  So this would really apply to Hertz because if it's like wait until next [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1349.8999999999999s)]
*  round of bet against Hertz, that would go. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1354.3799999999999s)]
*  But I mean, Dan, not only is Daniel is the best quarterback in this game. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1356.18s)]
*  He has been out of control. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1361.7s)]
*  I mean, his 70% of his passes, even if you look at like his last seven or eight, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1364.3799999999999s)]
*  he's like 20 touchdown, six picks. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1368.5s)]
*  He'll have the one throw a game. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1370.86s)]
*  Sure. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1373.58s)]
*  But he completes 70% of his passes and every fourth down in two and every fourth [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1374.66s)]
*  down in three, you just feel like he's going to get it. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1379.5s)]
*  And, and incredibly, he just doesn't take sacks. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1381.66s)]
*  He just doesn't take the Washington just doesn't get that set back. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1384.82s)]
*  Um, thrown thrown at him. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1389.38s)]
*  Now I do want to, if I have him, if I can have a moment, throw some water on some [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1391.26s)]
*  stuff, pour some settle down juice on the whole situation, right? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1396.7s)]
*  Because we're talking about an absolutely unprecedented outcome. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1399.54s)]
*  First of all, this is Washington's fourth road game coming up here. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1404.82s)]
*  It's not unprecedented. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1408.66s)]
*  The pets. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1409.9s)]
*  Well, I guess the pets played their first game at home and no one, but the [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1410.7s)]
*  pets were 14 point underdogs against this or 13 point underdogs against the [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1413.82s)]
*  Steelers and then 14 against the Rams. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1417.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1419.8600000000001s)]
*  So the starting point is fourth road game for throw game in a row in a row, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1420.74s)]
*  its own unique challenge. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1425.78s)]
*  But here's the stuff. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1427.1399999999999s)]
*  It's the rookie quarterbacks in conference championship games. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1428.1799999999998s)]
*  Never talked about this last week. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1431.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1432.9399999999998s)]
*  I wouldn't five straight up only one and four against the spread. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1433.1799999999998s)]
*  Also teams like Washington that were underdogs in the first two rounds and [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1437.1799999999998s)]
*  covered both of those rounds, one and five straight up two and four against the [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1441.6599999999999s)]
*  spread when it comes time for the conference, uh, championship. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1446.82s)]
*  And this one also underdogs in divisional, uh, rematches. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1450.5s)]
*  So Washington is the underdog. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1455.6200000000001s)]
*  It's a divisional rematch. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1457.6200000000001s)]
*  Oh, and four straight up one and three against the spread. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1459.5s)]
*  I mean, that's your settle down juice, right? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1461.8600000000001s)]
*  Uh, it just, there's no precedent for a team in Washington's position [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1463.78s)]
*  to actually win this game. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1468.78s)]
*  I think you can win. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1472.7s)]
*  There's two scenarios. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1473.82s)]
*  There's the scenario we laid out earlier where the Eagles just run the [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1474.94s)]
*  ball down your throat. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1477.42s)]
*  You don't get a fourth and two. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1478.7s)]
*  There's one turnover. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1480.26s)]
*  You're down 13. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1481.5s)]
*  You kind of know by the third quarter. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1482.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1485.58s)]
*  Great guys. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1486.82s)]
*  Great guys. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1487.9399999999998s)]
*  Then there's the other scenario where the Eagles can't throw the ball at all. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1489.2199999999998s)]
*  Washington is just loading up on Saquon. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1494.26s)]
*  The fans are frustrated. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1497.6599999999999s)]
*  You get one turnover, one strip sack, something. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1499.58s)]
*  Maybe you get a special team, something, and you're just hanging around, hanging [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1503.02s)]
*  around and it can get to the fourth quarter where it's either tied. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1506.94s)]
*  You're up three, you're down three, but you're in the mix of exactly where the [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1510.14s)]
*  Eagles fans don't want to be with this Eagles team. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1514.8200000000002s)]
*  And that's, that's it. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1518.46s)]
*  It's one of those two scenarios. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1519.8200000000002s)]
*  And I gotta say I'm leaning toward a Washington plus six and a half. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1521.46s)]
*  The colonoscopy juice has not really kicked in. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1527.5400000000002s)]
*  So that's a good sign for Washington. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1530.5s)]
*  I think I was thinking about the last 20 minutes we just did is going to be [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1532.02s)]
*  hilarious if you lose like 45 to 10. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1536.06s)]
*  It could happen. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1539.3799999999999s)]
*  Remember the hope? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1540.1799999999998s)]
*  It could happen. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1541.1799999999998s)]
*  The hope in their eyes. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1541.74s)]
*  It would still be fine. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1542.86s)]
*  I, I'm, I'm beyond, you know, any reasonable hope or expectation for this, this [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1544.3799999999999s)]
*  team, the franchise, what they've done. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1549.74s)]
*  Those moments of, of joy. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1551.74s)]
*  I mean, I hate that Washington did what it did to Detroit of all franchises. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1554.22s)]
*  You know, I bear no ill will towards, towards Detroit, but they [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1559.62s)]
*  didn't shut that stadium up. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1562.7s)]
*  I mean, it was silent in there and nothing would be more, more beautiful [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1564.22s)]
*  than doing that to the fit to the Philly crowd, but look, Philly might come out [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1569.34s)]
*  and, and just, you know, put, put us on our backs and run the road sled right over. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1573.5s)]
*  So it is possible. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1580.42s)]
*  They have the best offensive line. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1581.54s)]
*  It's been an incredible offensive line that Philly possesses. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1583.18s)]
*  What was the demeanor of Washington after the game? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1586.34s)]
*  Was it like they won the super bowl or it was like two more. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1589.54s)]
*  I, I, I, something in between those two because they're continuing to make sure [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1593.66s)]
*  it wasn't like we did it. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1597.82s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1598.8999999999999s)]
*  And then there's a lot of enthusiasm. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1599.54s)]
*  You know, there are, those guys are, are they believe in each other. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1602.02s)]
*  So they're coming out of both the Tampa game and that Detroit game. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1605.7s)]
*  Like there, there, there's a swagger, but there's also for sure. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1609.22s)]
*  Some, some exuberance that there'd be no doubt. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1613.42s)]
*  If you could take your colascomy juice, colas, colonoscopy juice, stained [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1616.18s)]
*  underwear and mail them to Dan Snyder without getting arrested, would you do it? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1621.46s)]
*  Oh, I mean, first of all, they're right now they're, they're small stains. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1626.18s)]
*  I sent you the picture. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1629.7s)]
*  Um, I would, I would, I would, I mean, would, I would send dad Snyder wouldn't, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1631.06s)]
*  wouldn't, wouldn't be those. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1636.38s)]
*  They're not nearly foul enough. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1637.5s)]
*  He, he, he, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1639.3s)]
*  colonoscopy juice house. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1639.7s)]
*  We've had drunk house, buzzed house, sober house. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1641.3400000000001s)]
*  And now we have colonoscopy juice house. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1644.94s)]
*  Uh, chiefs bills. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1647.46s)]
*  I just don't have a lot of, it's stupid to even talk advanced numbers of this game. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1649.06s)]
*  I don't really know what to say other than the chiefs just win these games all the [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1654.7s)]
*  time. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1658.6599999999999s)]
*  They've lost three times in the playoffs with my homes. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1659.1399999999999s)]
*  We went through the losses last week. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1661.3s)]
*  Uh, the only one where they really got their ass kicked was the super bowl. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1663.7s)]
*  They should have beaten the Patriots and we lucked out. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1669.54s)]
*  Even the Patriots fans would admit that and the Bengals game where my homes clearly [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1672.86s)]
*  got concussed near the end of the first half. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1677.8600000000001s)]
*  That was what it was. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1679.3400000000001s)]
*  Otherwise they just win these games. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1680.3000000000002s)]
*  The line is disrespectful. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1682.5800000000002s)]
*  Everyone's disrespected. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1684.66s)]
*  The bills are disrespectful from last week. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1685.98s)]
*  They're trying to get the nobody believes in us. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1688.5s)]
*  It's like, well, the Ravens were the best team in the league. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1690.74s)]
*  Like there's a reason they were, they ended up being favored. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1693.3400000000001s)]
*  Um, it's going to really are a nobody believes in this team. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1696.0600000000002s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1699.9s)]
*  At least nobody believes in the bills. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1700.8200000000002s)]
*  I feel like a lot of people are taking the same approach. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1704.22s)]
*  I think a lot of people are taking them this week. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1706.34s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1708.26s)]
*  I mean, that line hasn't moved open at one and a half stuck right there. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1709.6999999999998s)]
*  One and a half. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1714.22s)]
*  That to me says the bills are aren't, aren't a nobody believes in this team. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1714.78s)]
*  They're playing on the road against a team that's been to four of the last [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1718.58s)]
*  five AFC title games, so they're only plus one and a half. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1722.1399999999999s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1726.1399999999999s)]
*  I will say this. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1726.74s)]
*  Let's see what happens when the public wakes up Sunday morning or, you know, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1727.5s)]
*  Saturday night going into Sunday, because right now this is just a professional [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1731.58s)]
*  market, right? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1735.7s)]
*  Buffalo secondary looking a little banged up. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1737.14s)]
*  Not only looked, they are banged up, uh, both, uh, Christian Benford. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1740.54s)]
*  Um, I don't know if he, if he practiced, I mean, you know, he got, he had a [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1745.5800000000002s)]
*  concussion on the, uh, last play of the game against the rate and Taylor rap [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1749.9s)]
*  was Chris Crestonable with a hip injury. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1755.94s)]
*  Um, yeah, I mean, there, there's serious issues in their secondary. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1759.82s)]
*  So there's, there's a working case for a Buffalo pick and there's [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1764.7s)]
*  a working case for a chief's pick. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1768.18s)]
*  The chief's case is partly what we laid out about the, this is just [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1770.66s)]
*  the infrastructure of what they do. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1774.66s)]
*  This is the best mini dynasty we've had since the paths combined with the [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1776.58s)]
*  fact that there's really two cases now. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1782.18s)]
*  Trying to play this 20 game season where every year they're playing 19 or 20 [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1785.38s)]
*  games and they're one way in the regular season and they're barely scraping by. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1789.66s)]
*  And then around late December, they start, and then in January, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1795.02s)]
*  they become a different team. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1798.5s)]
*  So that's why it's almost like you can't look at the numbers, but, um, they're [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1800.1000000000001s)]
*  home, just the game they should win. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1804.66s)]
*  They hate the bills. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1806.9s)]
*  So there's all of that. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1809.26s)]
*  And I, I really liked their team. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1810.98s)]
*  I think this is the best they've looked the last couple of weeks. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1812.9s)]
*  The case for the bills is just Josh Allen grabs the torch from those. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1816.7s)]
*  Then that's it. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1821.02s)]
*  Cause that's the only way they're winning. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1822.02s)]
*  He could fucking grab the torch. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1823.46s)]
*  He could do it. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1825.8999999999999s)]
*  Walks off a la paint manning in 2006. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1827.46s)]
*  One of the things that, uh, the Texans showed us last week is that, you know, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1830.5s)]
*  there was a bunch of, of supportive numbers for the idea that Kansas [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1835.34s)]
*  cities run defense was a dominant run defense. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1839.1399999999999s)]
*  And then Joe Mixon got the ball and the Texans with their, the most, uh, the [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1842.22s)]
*  w the weakest unit of that Texans team is their offensive line and somehow they [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1847.98s)]
*  established the run and mixing was really effective and the Texans out yardage, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1852.7s)]
*  the chiefs, uh, you know, by, by, by quite a bit, like, you know, if the [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1858.7s)]
*  tech was a weird one though, because they had the long kick return. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1862.9s)]
*  So they had like, and then a three and out, but they still scored three points. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1866.38s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1870.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1871.3400000000001s)]
*  I'm talking only about the ability to establish the run, but I'm saying they, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1871.86s)]
*  they established the run and Buffalo's offensive line is good. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1877.22s)]
*  And if James Cook gets cooking and you know, Josh Allen, one of my favorite [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1881.98s)]
*  props of this week, especially with the quiet rush yards game that, that, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1887.1s)]
*  that Josh Allen had now he did get to 10 attempts over eight and a half attempts [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1892.18s)]
*  last week, that was a giant cash for everybody. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1896.46s)]
*  I hope everybody listened to the ringer pregame show, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1898.9s)]
*  but he was way under his yardage number. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1901.3s)]
*  I do not expect him to be under his yardage number this week. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1903.54s)]
*  This is a buy any means necessary. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1906.58s)]
*  Pull it all out, pull out every stop, pull it right out of your, your, your, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1908.26s)]
*  your, your butthole, uh, you know, nice, nice and clean Josh Allen. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1912.62s)]
*  I think he's going to rush. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1917.02s)]
*  I think 50 is a great number. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1918.06s)]
*  So I guess my question is, I really feel like Buffalo should have lost [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1921.1s)]
*  to Baltimore last week. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1924.62s)]
*  And I know that pisses the Baltimore fans off. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1925.54s)]
*  I used to piss me off as a Pats fan when we would beat somebody in the [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1927.46s)]
*  playoffs. Then people like, you shouldn't have won. You looked out. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1930.34s)]
*  Blah, blah, blah. And it's like, yeah, well, we didn't fucking turn the ball over [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1933.26s)]
*  and they did and we forced turnover. So fuck you. So I get it. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1935.98s)]
*  It's a fair answer. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1939.1399999999999s)]
*  Um, I just think Buffalo this whole season has looked a little better than they [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1940.34s)]
*  actually are. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1946.1399999999999s)]
*  And the chiefs have looked a little worse than they actually are until recently. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1947.1399999999999s)]
*  And one team I think has a little higher ceiling than the other team, unless [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1951.02s)]
*  Josh Allen just says, watch this, he could, that's why the line's one and a [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1956.1399999999999s)]
*  half. That's why it's you get one and a half for being at home. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1960.22s)]
*  It's a perfect matchup. I just like the chief's infrastructure. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1962.82s)]
*  Like there was that moment in the Houston game last week when all of a sudden [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1965.98s)]
*  spags dialed up all those funky blitzes, right? He's like waiting, waiting, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1970.1000000000001s)]
*  waiting. He's like, bam. And he just went after Stroud and fucked up a whole [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1974.18s)]
*  Texans drive. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1978.18s)]
*  There's some institutional knowledge of how to win these playoff games that I [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1979.46s)]
*  just don't want to bet against. And if Buffalo beats them, so be it. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1983.8600000000001s)]
*  I totally agree. I mean, that, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1987.78s)]
*  that has to be the approach, right? Like why would we put ourselves through the, [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1989.26s)]
*  the mental gymnastics to get to a spot where we say like definitively, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1994.18s)]
*  affirmatively, yes, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1998.58s)]
*  the bills are going to win this game and the points and all, you know, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=1999.74s)]
*  we'll grab the points and the bills is the case to make. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2002.34s)]
*  You have to work so hard. It's a simple case. It's the case you just made. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2005.86s)]
*  Josh Allen does the thing, does the superlative superior thing. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2010.06s)]
*  And that would be awesome. And I'll be fine with losing my money if he does it. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2014.46s)]
*  I'm not kidding, but I'm not betting against the Chiefs. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2018.3s)]
*  Just not going to do it. Not at this number. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2021.66s)]
*  Not at this number that they've won and covered every single time in the [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2024.02s)]
*  playoffs where it's been under three in this neighborhood. Yeah. Sign me up. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2027.5s)]
*  We talk about this. Well, we did it last year. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2031.66s)]
*  We bet against the Chiefs against the Ravens in the AFC title [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2033.8600000000001s)]
*  game. And it was a never again. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2038.9s)]
*  Never again. Lesson learned. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2043.06s)]
*  It was for me, at least as long as Mahomes is in his prime [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2045.9s)]
*  and as long as the Reed coaching infrastructure and they have a good enough [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2051.3s)]
*  team and they have Kelsey or somebody like him, I just don't want, I don't, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2054.46s)]
*  I didn't like the feeling of being like, why the fuck did I bet against the [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2058.06s)]
*  Chiefs? So they're going to have to lose before I stopped doing it. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2060.66s)]
*  This is, it's a little bit of us staying at the blackjack table too long, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2063.7s)]
*  but I also, Mahomes is in his late twenties. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2066.94s)]
*  Like, no, yeah, yeah. And respectfully, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2070.54s)]
*  it wasn't we, you didn't have me on million dollar picks for that Ravens [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2074.94s)]
*  Chiefs game. But you also had the Ravens. Oh no, I did not. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2078.14s)]
*  I definitely did not. You had the Chiefs? Did you zag it? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2081.34s)]
*  It was four and a half or five points. It was preposterous. Yeah. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2083.38s)]
*  That line was crazy talk. Playoff manifesto. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2086.2599999999998s)]
*  Really nothing, unless we want to create a manifesto role for the Chiefs. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2090.82s)]
*  They might deserve their own rule. Rule number 17 is don't try to be a hero. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2095.74s)]
*  Just try to win money. And that really applies to the Josh Allen thing. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2100.38s)]
*  It's like the Josh Allen scenario. It's like, don't try to be here. What's going to, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2103.26s)]
*  are you really ready when it's third quarter and it's 19 to 17 [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2106.6200000000003s)]
*  Chiefs and they have the ball and they're driving, are you going to be kicking [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2112.1000000000004s)]
*  yourself? There was a rule I proposed last year that I didn't really adopt, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2114.7400000000002s)]
*  but maybe I should new rule. What does the NFL really, really, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2118.78s)]
*  really want to happen? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2121.5s)]
*  This is very funny in view of what we watch out of the referees in that Houston [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2127.1000000000004s)]
*  game. Well, and it's been a big topic. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2131.7s)]
*  Has it? They really love the Chiefs. On the other hand, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2136.2599999999998s)]
*  with like a Buffalo Washington Super Bowl or Buffalo, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2139.3399999999997s)]
*  like I just feel like the one Super Bowl matchup that everybody's going to be [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2143.58s)]
*  like, Oh, what the fuck is Casey Philly? Right. That'll be the one. We're like, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2146.9399999999996s)]
*  Oh, we already did this. Come on. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2151.2599999999998s)]
*  It's still pretty good though. We did it. We did it. It's still pretty good. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2153.46s)]
*  Every other matchup. Super fun though. Washington, Buffalo, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2157.02s)]
*  Washington, Kansas City, Buffalo, Philly. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2160.54s)]
*  Every version of that is fun. The one, the Casey Philly is both of them have won [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2163.98s)]
*  Super Bowls within the last 10 years. They've already played each other. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2168.54s)]
*  I just can't get that excited about it. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2171.3799999999997s)]
*  I still don't like watching Philly's offense, but as fun as Barkley is, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2173.54s)]
*  it's really like a slog watching the 39 seconds of play. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2177.54s)]
*  You know who agrees with you? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2181.22s)]
*  What's going on here? He's also not healthy by the way. That's another guy. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2186.18s)]
*  He might come out and look like, you know, with a spring in his step, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2189.9s)]
*  but we haven't seen it. And those drops last week were big time. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2194.14s)]
*  I had a couple of prop bets for you before we get to the picks. Yeah. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2198.42s)]
*  I have some for you. Let's hear them. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2202.18s)]
*  What do you have? I'll hear yours first if you want. No, no, no, go ahead. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2205.22s)]
*  Daniel's no interceptions minus 104. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2209.5s)]
*  I don't love it. I wish the ads were better. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2215.46s)]
*  I don't love it only because of what you, um, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2218.5s)]
*  sort of observed was possible earlier, which is like the tip pass of the line of [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2223.02s)]
*  scrimmage. That defensive line. He gets hit as he's throwing it. All right. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2227.3399999999997s)]
*  Mahomes over four and a half carries minus 128, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2232.8599999999997s)]
*  which is it just feels like this line should be six and a half because you know, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2237.58s)]
*  he's going to scramble four times. There's the kneel down possibility. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2241.8199999999997s)]
*  It's the same number as last week. And we really didn't sweat that at all. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2244.9399999999996s)]
*  I don't like this at this stage of the playoffs. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2250.1s)]
*  Those two guys are running the football. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2253.8199999999997s)]
*  Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen are running the football. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2255.74s)]
*  So that juice on that, that's minus 120. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2260.14s)]
*  I don't find fine. Josh Allen, the score touchdown is minus 115. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2262.2599999999998s)]
*  I love the odds, but I, it just feels like if they're around the goal line, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2268.54s)]
*  you could even see it last week against the Ravens. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2271.9399999999996s)]
*  They were just doing the traditional QB draw play over and over again. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2273.82s)]
*  He's a badding Ram. He's a bad boy. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2277.86s)]
*  Him in the end zone makes a lot of sense to me. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2280.3s)]
*  And then, uh, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2283.26s)]
*  Kelsey hitting his over, which is 67 and a half. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2285.86s)]
*  And Casey to win is plus two Oh two. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2290.86s)]
*  And I feel like those two are correlated. Yeah. Correlated. Yes. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2293.98s)]
*  I agree with this. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2299.02s)]
*  So I marked that one down. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2299.82s)]
*  Casey and Washington to be the super bowl is plus five 18. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2302.1800000000003s)]
*  Here's my favorite one though. This is a five. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2307.34s)]
*  This is a five member same game parlay. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2310.06s)]
*  Wow. Kelsey 50 plus yards. Okay. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2315.06s)]
*  50 plus. Sure. Yes. That's a yes. That's a yes. That's a yes. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2318.7000000000003s)]
*  Matt Collins, one catch. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2323.46s)]
*  He's got to catch every just one, just one catch from Matt Collins. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2326.1400000000003s)]
*  He always gets a catch. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2330.1800000000003s)]
*  As long as he doesn't get kicked out of the game. Cause he's a psychopath. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2331.5800000000004s)]
*  As long as he's kicked out, then I like the idea of one. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2334.5800000000004s)]
*  Daniel's 250 plus passing rushing combined. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2338.82s)]
*  That's so that's, that's kind of appetizing cause I, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2345.42s)]
*  he's way over that every game. He would basically have to get hurt. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2347.86s)]
*  Not to get that. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2350.7799999999997s)]
*  He's in the 50 to 75 yard rush without really, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2351.62s)]
*  and at least 200. Yeah. Yeah. All right. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2356.2599999999998s)]
*  Dallas Goddard 25 plus yards. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2359.4199999999996s)]
*  That's one of my favorite props of the entire, I'm on Goddard every which way. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2361.7799999999997s)]
*  So you're with me for those first four. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2366.5s)]
*  Those four are on the target. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2368.06s)]
*  So I will let you choose who is the fifth here. I have two options. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2370.74s)]
*  Diami Brown 40 plus yards would make that five thing [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2375.18s)]
*  parlay plus three 80 or McLaurin 70 plus yards. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2379.94s)]
*  That's plus four 37. If you throw that one in, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2385.5s)]
*  does it have to be a Washington receiver for the fifth leg of this thing? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2388.86s)]
*  It does. I needed one Washington. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2392.2200000000003s)]
*  Why you don't want it to be a Washington receiver. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2395.82s)]
*  Well, they're there. The numbers are all over the place. It would be McLaurin. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2397.34s)]
*  I would feel much, much, much, much, much more comfortable with the idea of [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2401.58s)]
*  McLaurin, especially because it could come by way of what we watched. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2404.9s)]
*  Against Detroit, which is like a really smart play, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2410.58s)]
*  like a bubble kind of play a wheel route, you know, something that is unconventional, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2414.26s)]
*  something that McLaurin is going to be catching, but, but really it's, it's, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2418.98s)]
*  it's Austin Echler and it's Zach Ertz. That's who's catching the ball for Washington. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2423.62s)]
*  Those are your ball control guys. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2427.66s)]
*  That's how you matriculate the ball down the field. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2429.2200000000003s)]
*  That's how you possess the ball and have eight to 12 play drives and play and [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2431.78s)]
*  drives that take, you know, seven to nine minutes, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2437.18s)]
*  which is absolutely the pathway for Washington to potentially win this game. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2439.7s)]
*  So Echler, there's an alternate Echler rushing receiving where 25 plus is minus [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2445.8599999999997s)]
*  470 and 40 plus. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2454.7799999999997s)]
*  He's going to get that receiving. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2457.22s)]
*  He's going to get 40 plus is minus 165. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2458.06s)]
*  So you want to put that in instead of your receivers? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2460.9399999999996s)]
*  Austin Echler gets 40 plus rushing receiving yards. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2463.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I'm fine with that. I mean, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2467.06s)]
*  I don't think he's going to get a ton of touches in terms of the running game, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2468.18s)]
*  but he is such a crucial outlet for Jayden. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2472.02s)]
*  He factors into every time Jayden's under pressure, you know, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2475.8199999999997s)]
*  Echler is the guy that gets the first look and no, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2479.7799999999997s)]
*  Nicoby Dean is such a big deal for Philly. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2482.46s)]
*  Like that would be the dude that I would worry about taking away the Echler [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2484.8599999999997s)]
*  option, but I think I don't worry about that in this game. So I love, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2489.06s)]
*  I love the idea of Echler. He's going to touch the ball a lot, uh, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2493.18s)]
*  in my estimation. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2496.9s)]
*  All right. So we're going to do Accor as the fifth and I'll give you the odds [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2498.1800000000003s)]
*  when we actually do million dollar picks. Let me write that one down. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2501.26s)]
*  Uh, what were your props that you liked? [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2505.1800000000003s)]
*  Dallas Goddard. I'm not sure exactly where the number is at this, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2507.7000000000003s)]
*  at the moment I had him over 38 and a half yards. Um, there's an incredible, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2511.06s)]
*  uh, case to be made. Um, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2516.42s)]
*  he has at least 47 rushing yard, uh, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2519.38s)]
*  receiving yards in the last three games. Um, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2523.06s)]
*  he's got a full time role in the offense. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2526.7799999999997s)]
*  So would you go 40 plus yards for him and not 25? [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2529.14s)]
*  I'm fine. I'm fine with 40 plus. I mean, I'm sure that ramps up the odds. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2532.58s)]
*  I think that he's going to be, um, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2536.62s)]
*  a big time priority for hurt, especially if he's hurt, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2539.3399999999997s)]
*  which is, you know, a terrible thing, but he is that the safety valve for, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2543.98s)]
*  for, for jail in Washington against tight ends of season 26, uh, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2548.62s)]
*  in DVO way. And you know, he, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2553.22s)]
*  he's the guy that, that occupies kind of a short area. So he'll, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2555.58s)]
*  he'll get the touches. I'm, I like him over his receptions, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2559.74s)]
*  which I think is three and a half. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2562.86s)]
*  And I like them over his receiving yards as well. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2563.94s)]
*  I really have enjoyed betting him over the last few years in the playoffs. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2566.34s)]
*  Cause when he's actually healthy, he gets the ball and he gets a ball in big [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2570.22s)]
*  spots. And I always feel good about having him, uh, in there. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2573.54s)]
*  What else do you have? [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2577.34s)]
*  I love my home's longest pass completion over 34 and a half yards. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2578.22s)]
*  We talked a little bit about how the bills have those injuries in the [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2583.54s)]
*  secondary since week 14. And this is not tied to injuries. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2587.54s)]
*  Buffalo is 29th in drop back EPA. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2591.06s)]
*  So teams are able to pass the ball. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2594.54s)]
*  We watched this with our own two eyes with Lamar Jackson and that Baltimore [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2597.4199999999996s)]
*  offense, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2602.4199999999996s)]
*  the bills have allowed the fourth most passing yards since week 14 third most [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2603.2599999999998s)]
*  per attempt on throws of 20 yards over the last three years. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2608.2599999999998s)]
*  Or, or more. And Lamar had, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2613.2200000000003s)]
*  he went three of five on 20 yard or more pass attempts. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2616.3s)]
*  Uh, both Rashad Bateman and Isaiah likely had catches over 35 yards last week. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2621.26s)]
*  And what I especially am keying in on here is my homes with the compliment of [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2627.7000000000003s)]
*  receivers that we haven't really seen them. We haven't, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2634.1s)]
*  this is an element of the chief's offense we haven't really seen. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2636.94s)]
*  And we know we intuit that the chief show up to a game like this with a wrinkle [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2639.8199999999997s)]
*  that we haven't really seen. I think he's dying to get the ball down the field. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2644.18s)]
*  34 and a half. Uh, it was minus one to eight on Fandl when I typed this in. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2647.8199999999997s)]
*  Wow. I really like that one house. House. Good job. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2652.14s)]
*  Thank you. Go, go take a dump and come back and we'll do million dollar pick. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2657.06s)]
*  No, I'm kidding. Um, all right. So we have some good ones. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2660.7799999999997s)]
*  Is there anything else? Is there any kicker stuff we want to do? Nothing. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2663.8599999999997s)]
*  No, I don't know. So Jake Elliott to miss a point after. Yes. That mother effort. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2666.54s)]
*  I mean, that was the difference between a six point, you know, [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2671.14s)]
*  non-spread and the seven point car. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2673.94s)]
*  Got to do Josh Allen over rushing yards at 47 and a half. You got it. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2676.54s)]
*  I think you have to play that. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2680.3s)]
*  Yeah. I always feel like I lose on those. You don't, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2682.58s)]
*  do you like the unders in both of these games or is it just me? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2684.86s)]
*  I think Kansas city and Buffalo have the potential. They could. Yeah, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2688.7000000000003s)]
*  for sure. Because I mean, you know, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2693.82s)]
*  Buffalo, um, I think we'll be able to run the ball. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2695.7s)]
*  So that's 48 and a half that over. And then the other one, Philly, Washington, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2698.78s)]
*  is 47 and a half. So that, that, um, Kansas city, Buffalo number moved. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2702.18s)]
*  It was 47 and a half earlier this week. So people are catching onto this. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2706.7s)]
*  I think both these games are going to be very similar with these teams [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2710.34s)]
*  methodically going down and trying to keep the other teams offense could be off [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2713.5s)]
*  the field. All right, let's do it. Uh, last but not least, do you, [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2717.5s)]
*  do you like Washington plus six and a half with juice? [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2723.54s)]
*  It's minus one 20 and Fando or Washington plus five and a half even odds. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2726.74s)]
*  Oh, I much prefer six and a half to five and a half. Okay. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2731.46s)]
*  Six is a key number as we just watched on Sunday. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2735.22s)]
*  We did just watch it on Sunday. All right. It's time [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2739.66s)]
*  the million dollar picks conference championship weekend, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2746.42s)]
*  trying to rally. We lost some last week. We lost $585,000 still up. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2751.1s)]
*  This is why you build the nest egg during the season. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2756.14s)]
*  Still up 1.282 million for this season. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2758.22s)]
*  Joe house has been helping out a lot of the time. He's decked out in Washington, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2761.94s)]
*  all his gear. Uh, we're going to take the chiefs, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2766.02s)]
*  money line or minus one and a half. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2770.5s)]
*  However you like could do both. Both are fine. Maybe. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2773.7799999999997s)]
*  Well, the money line is minus one 26 and the minus one and a half is minus one [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2777.66s)]
*  12. And I would just rather take the, you would, [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2782.18s)]
*  you want to lay the point. It's fine. And then they, they win 24, 23. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2786.1s)]
*  And, and okay. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2790.7799999999997s)]
*  Chiefs minus one 26. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2796.54s)]
*  We are not betting against the infrastructure. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2799.14s)]
*  I did it last year at million dollar picks in the AFC title game. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2801.06s)]
*  And I just said, never again, never again, never again, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2804.42s)]
*  at least while they have this iteration of them chiefs minus one 26 over the [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2807.82s)]
*  bills 300 K. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2812.58s)]
*  Yeah. Yes. Yeah. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2815.78s)]
*  And then houses Washington, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2818.7400000000002s)]
*  he officially said it's okay to call them the commanders. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2822.34s)]
*  I'm saying it. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2825.06s)]
*  They are the Washington commanders because they, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2826.2200000000003s)]
*  they took that name from the colonoscopy Jews toilet and they [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2828.5s)]
*  propped it up. It, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2833.94s)]
*  if this name belongs to this guy right here, number five over my, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2834.94s)]
*  uh, left shoulder and it's, and he is the common dot of the commanders. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2839.62s)]
*  This is the Washington commanders. I'm here for it. Hail to the C words. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2844.42s)]
*  We are banking on a close game and we are grabbing Washington plus six and a [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2849.94s)]
*  half at minus one 20. This feels to both of us. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2854.58s)]
*  And house has been very respectful of not veering too hard pro [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2858.02s)]
*  Washington. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2862.5s)]
*  And even there was a couple of weeks where I felt like you were intentionally not [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4NCKokO3g&t=2863.66s)]
