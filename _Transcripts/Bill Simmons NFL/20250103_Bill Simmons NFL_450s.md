# What’s Next for Aaron Rodgers and the Jets? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [January 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=0.0s)]
*  Enough optimism. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=0.24s)]
*  The jets. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=1.12s)]
*  Couldn't wait. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=2.32s)]
*  You could not wait to get off of that. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=3.04s)]
*  This is it. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  This is it for Rogers and Devante Adams and the coach. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=6.88s)]
*  And you need a new GM and you obviously need a new owner, but that's not happening. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=10.4s)]
*  There was a big athletic story about how weird it is with the owner and his kids being involved. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=18.8s)]
*  And it's, it was just over and over again. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=23.36s)]
*  And the data confirming the anecdotes, confirming the eye test, confirming that this is one of the most memorable [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=26.72s)]
*  bullshit shows in a while. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=33.6s)]
*  You predicted it before the season. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=35.68s)]
*  It's been even worse than I think you would have imagined. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=37.68s)]
*  I would, I would not have predicted four and 13. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=40.16s)]
*  I would have, I would have said maybe seven and 10 and they missed the playoffs or eight and nine. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=43.68s)]
*  And they missed the playoffs. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=48.56s)]
*  Last year there were seven and 10 with Zach Wilson. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=49.28s)]
*  Yeah, they were seven and 10 with Zach Wilson, two seasons in a row. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=51.68s)]
*  And they're about to go four and 13 probably with Aaron Rogers and basically great health. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=54.56s)]
*  They have not had a lot of massive injuries. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  They lost CJ Mosley for a while. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=62.24s)]
*  They've had some, some health issues on the offensive line, but like Rogers hasn't missed a game. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=64.0s)]
*  Perese Hall has only missed one or two games. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=70.4s)]
*  I think Garrett Wilson hasn't missed a game. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  I mean, their best players are playing and they stink. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=74.0s)]
*  They're terribly coached. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=77.68s)]
*  Aaron Rogers is obviously an awful influence on the organization. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=79.44s)]
*  I still don't really understand what the fuck he's talking about in public, like 85% of the time. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=84.16s)]
*  I have no idea why he's grinding axes the way that he is considering how poorly he's played. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=88.0s)]
*  His stats are really good and they're very deceptive if you've been watching the games, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=91.6s)]
*  which I unfortunately have been. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=94.56s)]
*  He can't move as well in the pocket and he's so, so careful in his desire to not make a mistake [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  that he often doesn't take chances where you need to to have an exciting offense. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=103.92s)]
*  So it's just not fun to watch what should at least be like an entertaining offensive team. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=107.52s)]
*  They've sucked on offense this year, so it's been horrible. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=112.4s)]
*  The body language doctor is not like anything he's seen. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=116.16000000000001s)]
*  No, but I think that point that you made earlier though, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=121.04s)]
*  not being able to understand what his agenda or his point is in some of his interviews, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=126.4s)]
*  I think is a great point because sometimes I'll see transcripts or there'll be some clip that [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=130.96s)]
*  goes on Twitter and it's like, Roger says this on MacFann, I watch it and you almost wonder is like, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=136.0s)]
*  is this a bit? Like, what's he doing? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=143.28s)]
*  I think he's just really online and really like responding to the critics, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  but we don't know who the critics are because we don't see his mentions, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  the mentions of his mind. I mean, he just seems like a really weird guy right now. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=154.08s)]
*  Well, that's especially to be the guy who's supposed to be the calming force, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=158.88s)]
*  the driver of your race car, where you have somebody super radical now seems like he's [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=164.32s)]
*  clearly hoping he doesn't have to come back next year and seems like he's getting a little [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=168.96s)]
*  bridge burning so they'll maybe get rid of him. Can I suggest a theory to you? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=174.08s)]
*  Yeah, let's hear it. So let's look at like the last 10 years [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=180.16s)]
*  of professional athletes. We've had more and more great stars play longer and longer into their [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=184.72s)]
*  careers, right? We've got Tom Brady, we've got LeBron James, you know, even like Federer played [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=191.44s)]
*  for a very long time, like a lot of great athletes who extended their careers for health reasons or [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=196.4s)]
*  what have you, but a lot of those people have gotten like more and more odd in their public [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=201.68s)]
*  persona. And one way to think about it is like being famous for a long time makes you kind of [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=206.72s)]
*  crazy, right? It makes you paranoid, it makes you entitled. But I'm about the same age as Aaron [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  Rogers and like I'm getting weirder and I'm getting like riddled with anxieties and there [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=218.0s)]
*  are certain things that I'm like my body is breaking down and I'm getting bent out of shape [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=223.28s)]
*  about it and I've got a family and I've got different kinds of responsibilities. So it's like [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=227.44s)]
*  when you're 27 and you're locked in on your sport and you're the thing that you're doing, it's because [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=232.32s)]
*  you don't have anything else going on in your life. When you get older and like your parents start dying [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=237.6s)]
*  and you start thinking about your legacy, whatever the hell that is, you get weird. And Aaron Rogers [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=242.96s)]
*  just seems like he's been going through a midlife crisis for like four years and we keep thinking [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=248.88s)]
*  he's the guy from 2011 in Green Bay. And he's not, he's just a middle-aged guy who just happens to [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=253.2s)]
*  be one of the best throwers of the football of all time. And so it's been fucking annoying that the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=258.32s)]
*  one time we got a genuinely great quarterback, it happened to coincide with him going through [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=262.56s)]
*  a personal emotional crisis and we're watching it transpire in real time. It's a good theory. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=267.2s)]
*  Well I wonder how much of that ties into COVID and how weird so many people got just being alone for [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=271.91999999999996s)]
*  nine, 10 months during COVID and getting pushed to be more and more online. And like if you [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=278.56s)]
*  didn't have a family around and you're just by yourself a lot, like what were the ramifications [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=284.8s)]
*  that we both know people in our lives that just pre-post-COVID just felt like they were slightly [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=288.72s)]
*  different people. Yeah, look at CR. He's completely falling apart. Yeah, CR is, I mean I wasn't going [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=294.08s)]
*  to mention that. CR is now a maniac. Now I don't know how it plays out, but I do feel like there's [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=299.04s)]
*  some end game with him where he's not going to retire and he clearly thinks something is happening [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=306.72s)]
*  for him next year somewhere and I just don't know where that is. Yeah, I was thinking about that too. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  He probably should retire. He can clearly still play. I don't know if he can play at a high level. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=317.92s)]
*  I don't know. I don't feel like he can move in the same way anymore. He can't. The thing that's [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=322.64000000000004s)]
*  notable this year is he used to be so great at evading pressure and buying himself two, three, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=327.6s)]
*  so he just can't do it anymore. No. And as you said earlier, it doesn't seem like he wants to [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=333.2s)]
*  make mistakes. He's going to finish the season with 26 touchdowns and 10 picks and on paper it'll [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=338.96s)]
*  look great, but he also, he only does throws that are like these safe throws down the sidelines, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=345.44s)]
*  these timing catches or these quick things and you rarely see him just being like Josh Allen gunning [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=351.12s)]
*  it. Yeah, I mean it's hard to watch kind of what the contemporary superstar quarterback is now [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=358.4s)]
*  relative to what his play is like and what the Jets quarterback play has been like for the last [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=363.76s)]
*  50 years. That's the thing is like if he finishes with 26 and 10 and throws for 3,800 yards, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=367.91999999999996s)]
*  that's a top five quarterback season in Jets history. Like that's how pathetic the team is, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=373.28s)]
*  even though he has been terrible. So it's not ideal. I feel like, I don't know, like if the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=377.28s)]
*  Cardinals trade Kyler Murray, is there a one year Aaron Rodgers thing that could happen there? You [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=385.12s)]
*  know what I mean? Like there, it feels like there are some spots where you could comfortably see [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=389.6s)]
*  him in a warm weather situation having one last hurrah, but I just don't want it to be in New York. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=393.92s)]
*  I think Brady has ruined our ability to look at all of this stuff logically, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=401.28000000000003s)]
*  because quarterbacks are supposed to hit their late thirties and just get worse every year and [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=405.6s)]
*  then Brady just didn't happen with him. And I've said this before, but it's very similar to LeBron [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=410.16s)]
*  thing. Like the LeBron thing is just really unusual. We're not going to see a lot of people [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=414.96s)]
*  just play until they're 40 and be able to put up 25, 10 and seven and just bowl through guys, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=419.91999999999996s)]
*  even though they've had a kajillion miles. So I don't know. I think this is what it should end [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=425.68s)]
*  like. This Kirk Cousins, same thing. You should hit your late thirties and you should start [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=431.59999999999997s)]
*  becoming worse at quarterback. It's too hard to play. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxefmL7nEls&t=436.56s)]
