# Alarming NFL Win Totals With Michael Lombardi | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [May 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-35mBaqbtqc)
*  All right, Lombardi, let's just do it.
*  We don't have to spend a million hours on this, but I'm going to give you nine teams.
*  I'm going to give you nine teams where I just looked at the win totals and the win totals
*  jumped out at me.
*  Okay.
*  One way or the other.
*  I was like, Ooh, that seems higher.
*  Ooh, that seems too low.
*  I had nine teams.
*  I'll give you the, you want the two low teams first or do you want the two high teams?
*  Whatever you want to do, mix it up.
*  I don't care.
*  All right.
*  I'll do two high first where I just first glimpse.
*  I was like, Ooh, Texans six and a half.
*  That seems high.
*  Why are the Texans going to be good?
*  I go down there.
*  To me, that one seems way too high.
*  The only reason I think it's at six and a half is because of the uncertainty in Indianapolis.
*  You know, is Tennessee going to be any good?
*  Everybody thinks that Will Leves is going to play by week four or five.
*  You know, I don't see it.
*  I know Houston was in a lot of games, but if they play Stroud, I think it's going to
*  be a problem.
*  It's a hard time winning game.
*  They're not good enough on defense to play that D'Amico Ryan style of defense, which
*  is a cover three Seattle cover three, which unless you dominate the front, it's hard to
*  really dominate defensively.
*  So I would go under that to me.
*  I think that's, I think it's more of a five and a half number there.
*  The only way you would say over is just because they don't have their first round pick and
*  in football for whatever reason, we don't protect picks.
*  Yeah.
*  So I trade that pick to Arizona.
*  It's like, Hey, can you make that a top four protector first?
*  I'm pretty sure Arizona is doing that anyway.
*  Okay.
*  We'll roll it over if it's in the four.
*  I've been saying that for years.
*  Like I don't understand it.
*  I agree with you.
*  Like I don't know why we don't lottery protect the pick.
*  And then, you know, we trade the Jets trade.
*  If Rogers doesn't play 65%, you know, it's a bad trade for the Jets, right?
*  But you know, he's going to pay 65%.
*  But really, what are you getting if you're green belt?
*  You're getting 28, 29.
*  You're getting, you're not getting a first round pick.
*  I mean, only 11 of the 32 guys, I think, I think 11 maybe picked up their 50 year option.
*  People talk about, Oh, we got to get in the first round to get a 50 year.
*  Nobody wants the 50 year option.
*  It's too ridiculous.
*  Right.
*  Next team that was too high.
*  This one I double-taked.
*  The Falcons are eight and a half.
*  I know.
*  Well, what the hell?
*  They're just because they have some good, they're a fantasy team.
*  Do they have lines?
*  Do they have a quarterback?
*  There are seven on 17 without a quarterback.
*  I think a lot of it is because of the division.
*  The camp is going to suck.
*  You know, what's Carolina with the quarterback?
*  I mean, did you see anything out of Ritter that you would say, Oh, where?
*  Now look, I think Arthur Smith and they played a lot of good games, but defensively, every
*  defensive lineman is over 30 years old.
*  I mean, I don't know.
*  I mean, I don't know how they're going to be able to really play that way and win.
*  You know, last year, Mariotta gave them, so they ran that six back offense.
*  But at some point, you got to have to have the drop back pass game.
*  I think that's way too high for Atlanta.
*  I was in on Ritter and then I watched him and there was, cause I kind of liked that
*  Falcons team.
*  I liked Algier.
*  I thought they could run the ball and they had some weapons.
*  I thought they were pretty well coached and Ritter came in and said, all right, this would
*  be fun.
*  I'm going to bet on them this week.
*  I like in a half.
*  I was like, Oh my God, what is this guy?
*  Is he even a backup?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, he was terrible.
*  I don't know how they don't draft Jalen Carter.
*  They're 50 miles from his campus.
*  They don't know that player better than anybody.
*  They need a three technique.
*  One of the most non-talked about positions in the NFL is three technique.
*  Everybody thinks you have a great, they're very few great three techniques.
*  And when you have one, you're a really good defense and Atlanta could drafted him and
*  yet they give them the filling and they take a run.
*  I love Bichon Robinson, but they had good running backs on that team.
*  They really did.
*  I loved Algier.
*  It was like that would not have been a position I would have picked for the Falcons.
*  All right, next team.
*  I mean, this is really just me setting you up now.
*  This is right now.
*  I'm like Steve Nash, just driving the lane, fishing off.
*  Yeah.
*  There's no chance Belichick's not getting over a seven.
*  No, no, we're going to get that later.
*  We're doing that.
*  We haven't gotten the two low yet.
*  This is still the two high group.
*  Bears, seven and a half.
*  They're going to go eight and nine.
*  The Chicago Bears.
*  They got the MVP, Bill.
*  They got the MVP on their team.
*  We've just given them the award.
*  I mean, the guy that doesn't have Joe Montana in his top five quarterbacks is now giving
*  out MVP awards in May.
*  I love this.
*  This is incredible.
*  I like, I just, I shake my head when he talks because I just like, how is this possible?
*  Okay, let's go through some evidence.
*  Ninety one sacks averages seven yards every time he gets sacked.
*  Twenty nine fumbles in two years.
*  Right.
*  I mean, the guy's a walking turnover machine.
*  Doesn't throw the ball.
*  His numbers.
*  I mean, I took shit.
*  Davis Mills' numbers and his numbers passing are identical.
*  The problem is Davis Mills won five games.
*  This guy's won four.
*  Yeah.
*  It pays to have a great PR campaign.
*  And who says the Bears are any good on defense?
*  And I'll add one more for it.
*  Who says Matt Eberfluss is going to be a good head coach?
*  There's a lot of question marks.
*  The thing with fields that always made me nervous was they would fall behind and they
*  still wouldn't throw.
*  Yeah.
*  Usually when you're down 20, isn't that a good time to be like, ah, they're in, they're
*  in prevent.
*  Let's get some completions.
*  They wouldn't even throw then.
*  Well, let me put it in perspective for you.
*  The Indianapolis Colts and the Bears, their losing total was 8.5 points per game.
*  That's the point differential.
*  The Colts threw the ball 35 times per game.
*  The Bears threw it 22.
*  They didn't even want to throw when they got behind.
*  22?
*  22 throws a game is all they wanted to do.
*  I mean, look, the guy doesn't throw the ball.
*  Now, here's the, we're in this Buzz Lightyear's part of the year.
*  This is Buzz Lightyear.
*  He's light years ahead of everybody now.
*  He's light years ahead of where he was last year.
*  Well, he can't complete a crossing route.
*  Like come on.
*  And you talk about, you know, Kevin O'Connor should look at his throwing motion.
*  One of the things that really made a lot of people down on fields was his throwing motion,
*  how, how it was so loose and it wasn't going to ever be able to be corrected.
*  The one thing with that, like he killed the Patriots.
*  He had a couple games this year where at least for half you could see it.
*  Now I really like DJ Moore.
*  And if it's there, it's got to be there this year or else you have to really, you have
*  to really be like, all right, this is just not happening.
*  That's the, we just got to get better players around him and it'll be good.
*  And then you get better players around him and it's still not good.
*  Like that's the, I should call that the envy philosophy.
*  Like that's like DJ Moore isn't going to, I mean, he's got to get the ball to him.
*  He's got to throw it to him.
*  And he's got to read it and he's got to be able to understand what he's doing.
*  You get sacked 91 times in two years.
*  You don't understand how to protect.
*  So bare seven and a half under here's the last one for the two high group.
*  The Niners are 11 and a half over under wins.
*  And that is like the all time.
*  I respect Kyle Shanahan over under total.
*  Yeah.
*  Quarterbacks are Sam Darnold, uh, Brooke Purdy, Brock Purdy.
*  I don't even know if he's gonna be back in time and Trey Lance, you know, who
*  Mr. workout, um, Sam Darnold, who.
*  On a platter, a playoff spot last year, big lead against Tampa.
*  Like it's actually sitting there for Carolina to go to the playoffs and he
*  couldn't play two halves in a row.
*  How is Shanahan?
*  Shanahan's had these quotes where he's like, this guy to me is like, he's
*  a true number one pick.
*  He's so talented.
*  I can't wait to have him.
*  Doesn't he watch film?
*  I don't, you love Shanahan.
*  I just don't get this.
*  I mean, I think when you want like that game in Tampa, you know, bad
*  interception in the red zone, they couldn't cover my Mark Mike Evans in that game.
*  Right.
*  Uh, I thought he played better last year, but here's what I think's going on.
*  My, the one twin total, you got 11 and a half.
*  Once the draft ended San Francisco went to 10 and a half on a lot of shops.
*  So I think,
*  Oh shit.
*  Well, unfandled right now it's 11 and a half.
*  That's right.
*  I grabbed.
*  There's some places out there at 10 and a half.
*  I mean, to me, uh, look, trade Lance hasn't played football in four years.
*  We saw the Sean Watson not play football and how long and how bad did he look?
*  Uh, you know, now Kyle came out and said, we have three franchise
*  quarterbacks.
*  I've missed that memo.
*  Like, I mean, I, I haven't seen that one.
*  I don't know if Brock, I think he meant, I think he meant they play for a
*  franchise.
*  Yeah, I've missed that.
*  I mean, look, you're going to San Francisco.
*  He does make the game quarterback friendly.
*  And you say, well, why wasn't Lance very good?
*  Well, perhaps maybe Lance wasn't very good.
*  I mean, look, they tried to trade that they would love for somebody to take
*  Lance off their head.
*  They can't give him away.
*  Yeah.
*  Nobody knows what he is.
*  Uh, you know, they win with their, here's the thing you worry about.
*  You go over San Francisco.
*  That they'd have a hard time always staying healthy for 17 games last year.
*  They got better at the end of the year.
*  And, you know, and are they going to have the quarterback?
*  I mean, that's going to be the issue.
*  That seems to have, well, going to the too low, I have five too low teams and
*  I'll just, I'll tie the Seahawks to them.
*  The Seahawks are eight and a half.
*  Yeah.
*  I thought that line was going to be at least nine and a half, maybe even 10.
*  And the Vegas is telling me if they go nine and eight, you wouldn't the bet.
*  I liked them for the division too, for the division.
*  They are at least on Fandl plus two 60.
*  So to me, that's a toss up between those two teams.
*  Cause the San Francisco quarterback thing, but am I too high in Seattle?
*  No, I think Seattle had another really good draft and Gino Smith's going to
*  play as good as he did last year.
*  Maybe better.
*  The two rookie tackles will be improved and they got a three technique.
*  They signed her Monte Jones.
*  The first three technique Pete Carroll's had since he lost Michael better.
*  I mean, look, the Rams are going to be atrocious and I think the Rams and
*  I think it's the Arizona there's four wins right there.
*  They should have four wins right there.
*  And now all they need is five more wins over the next.
*  I think that's a pretty good bet.
*  Yeah.
*  I saw the Cardinals were 24 to one when the NFC West and I was trying to think
*  about ever seen a 24 to one, I think those are the worst odds I've ever seen,
*  but it makes sense.
*  Arizona is going to be.
*  You know, horrific and probably thinking about next year right away.
*  And they're going to have basically two chances at a top five pick.
*  Well, they're going to, they could get Kelly, Kelly,
*  boy, Caleb Williams from USC.
*  Do they take him or do they continue to go down the road with the mayor of
*  Munchkin land?
*  I mean, like, seriously, what do they do?
*  Right.
*  Like he talked about a guy that you ruined, you paid when you didn't have to pay him.
*  I mean, that's going to be an interesting question.
*  Talk about a culture guy.
*  Yeah.
*  The worst.
*  I mean, I'm surprised the Sixers didn't try to sign him to come off the bench.
*  We would love to have them.
*  I'm sure we would.
*  You know,
*  all right.
*  Four more teams and then we're done.
*  Look, the Steelers, the overrunners, eight and a half.
*  And to me, that's like betting against the house and blackjack.
*  Like Tom is basically the house.
*  He's just going to go nine and eight, 10 and I don't care who's on his team.
*  I actually like what I saw from Pickett last year.
*  Seemed like they had a pretty good draft.
*  Um, I don't know.
*  That seems like at least a nine win team to me, right?
*  They got better as the year went on to, they really improved from the time they got
*  blown out of Buffalo to the end of the year.
*  I mean, they were, they were, they were giving everybody some trouble.
*  Look, the guy's a really good coach.
*  And what I think people misconstrue is it takes three elements of your team to win
*  offense, defense and the kicking game.
*  And Tomlin's really good at that.
*  They didn't play well at home last year.
*  I mean, in that loss, remember the great Zach Wilson had the 14.4th quarter.
*  That that was one of their losses.
*  Kenny Pickett throws two bad interceptions in that game or else they're going to have
*  what they have nine win though.
*  They would have, they would have maybe competed for a playoff.
*  So with you on Pittsburgh, I'm always going to bet on the over with Tomlin.
*  Me too.
*  I kind of like Pickett.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I don't think he's bad.
*  Well, he's never going to be a top five player, but what they have is they know
*  they need the players around them.
*  So they're going to manage him correctly.
*  And that's half the battle with quarterbacking.
*  Like everybody thinks no quarterback needs to be met.
*  They all need to be managed.
*  They all need to have the right system in place to make them most efficient.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, all right.
*  The next ones are all seven and a half, three Panthers, seven and a half.
*  I just think they have a lot of talent and I don't know if Bryce will be ready
*  next year, but he's probably the best bet of all these quarterbacks to at least
*  be decent next year, but I bet on the Panthers second half of the year, they
*  were really good to me until that last Tampa game.
*  I just thought, and your son worked there last year.
*  Yeah.
*  I thought they had a lot of good players on both sides of the ball compared to
*  what their record was and that I thought they under achieved.
*  So to me, seven and a half in a bad division, that seems reasonable.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, look, that DJ Moore keeps his hat on.
*  They make the playoffs, you know, if the kicker makes an extra point,
*  they make the playoffs.
*  I mean, look, they're not a first pick overall in the draft team.
*  They're good defensively.
*  That offensive line is really good.
*  Miles Sanders will give them another run to go with Hubbard.
*  So I'm with you and I think Bryce Young will be really good for them.
*  He gives them, you know, part of this, we don't put into it.
*  It started this conversation, but when the quarterback's a great leader,
*  it's the, you know, Jimmy G for San Francisco, Bryce Young will be that for
*  Carolina.
*  That's really important.
*  You get that guy that's really driving the team at quarterback.
*  That's really important.
*  Yeah.
*  I like some of the stories.
*  As you know, I'm not a huge college football guy, but I like some of the
*  stories about the Sunday after the Saturday game, he was the first guy there
*  in Alabama and already like thinking about like just unusual stuff for, for
*  that.
*  Uh, all right, two more.
*  The Packers, seven and a half.
*  There's, I just didn't think Rogers was that good last year and that line is
*  built in, oh, they're going to take such a hit at quarterback.
*  And it's like, well, he was like a B minus last year for them.
*  They have a lot of talents though.
*  Why, why are the Bears and the Packers the same?
*  That's what I keep asking everybody.
*  The Packers are better on defense than they are.
*  The Packer special teams improved last year with that returner that they got in
*  there.
*  Look, and they've got really good running backs.
*  Their offensive line is now we're going to be really young.
*  I think the Packers will develop as year goes on.
*  I don't know what to make of Jordan Love.
*  I think if you're betting the over there, you're saying Jordan Love's going to be
*  decent.
*  I would have a hard time making that bet with LaFleur and Jordan Love, two
*  unknowns, cause this is the first time LaFleur is actually going to have to coach
*  a team and really Lee, can he do that?
*  You know, he's got two 13 win seasons riding on the coattails of the MVP or
*  Aaron Rodgers.
*  It's going to be interesting to see what he does, how he adapts the offense.
*  You know, for me, I'm a cautiously waiting, but to me, there's no reason how
*  they're the same as the Bears.
*  To me, they're better on defense than the Bears alone.
*  So for that one, I think I like the Green Bay division odds more than the
*  over under because as you said, I'm basically betting on Jordan Love.
*  And if he's decent, that team's talented in the division, at least on Fandl
*  they're plus 350.
*  Well, yeah.
*  And a division where like Detroit's coming out of the gate, they're in that
*  first game, you know, they're going to lose that there's own one, you know,
*  their schedule is going to be harder.
*  They got, they weren't a bunch of national games.
*  Everybody's thinking of them as like, Oh, that's the team.
*  I didn't love their draft.
*  I didn't love what they did.
*  And I just say like, there's some red flags with them every year.
*  There's the team that gets the ton of attention and it goes sideways and I
*  could see it happening with them.
*  Three teams, Minnesota, New York, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas,
*  and Detroit, you can put Jacksonville in there too.
*  It's going from good to great.
*  And that's the hardest thing to do in sports is to go from good to great is to
*  get players to understand what it takes to become great.
*  And everybody wants to get paid.
*  The Giants paying their guys, right?
*  It's the Riley disease of me.
*  Everybody wants to get paid.
*  Once we made the playoffs.
*  Now Minnesota is dumping those guys because they got cap room, you know, but
*  a team like Washington, if you have brought up, I don't trust Rivera, but if
*  if Washington traded for Dalvin cook, I play the over because if they had Dalvin
*  cook on that team with their defense, that would be a really smart play.
*  You know, it's funny you mentioned Jacksonville because they were minus 160
*  for the division and I couldn't decide if that was too high or too low.
*  Cause I can't think of a single other team I like in that division, but I
*  also like the Jaguars being minus favorites in division.
*  I was like, Ooh, seems early.
*  I mean, Gray Bull is too good of a coach to just, I think he's got a little bit
*  Mike Tomlin in them.
*  Uh, you know, I mean, I think he's going to, with a year to coach this team.
*  Well, I don't trust Levis nor do I trust Tattahill, but for him, I mean, this is
*  the most remarkable thing I've ever seen in my career in the NFL on a Sunday
*  night game in Kansas city, both teams coming off a buy Malik Willis gets a
*  first down with five minutes to go in the second quarter, and they only get one
*  for the remainder of the game into overtime.
*  And yet the game went into overtime.
*  That's one of the most remarkable coaching jobs in a history of coaching
*  with a guy who will probably never play quarterback in the NFL.
*  He should never play quarterback again, but remember he was a top 10 pick
*  this time last year.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Uh, last one, the Pats are seven and a half.
*  I'm at, I'm actually like offended because they went eight and nine last year.
*  And they left two wins on the table that they just gave literally gave to the
*  other team, they had Matt Patricia, the bane of my existence, a guy who cost you
*  a Superbowl ring as the offensive coordinator.
*  They had more dysfunction.
*  It was the most unbellowed check, sloppiest, weirdest, terrible game
*  management season strategy.
*  Like, Oh my God, is the old man losing it kind of season.
*  And now they have, you know, they, they prior reprioritize the coaching staff.
*  They had a good, really good draft.
*  I thought they have a shitload of talent and we're talking, you were saying like,
*  what am I getting with Jordan love?
*  It's like, well, max done more than Jordan love has.
*  Yeah, no doubt.
*  No question.
*  They can't go eight and nine.
*  Also like, why am I afraid of the Bills at this point?
*  Like what have the Bills done?
*  They blew a, they blew the playoffs in 13 seconds, two years ago.
*  Last year they rolled over and got their asses kicked in the playoffs.
*  Like, why is that a juggernaut?
*  I mean, look, people forget the season.
*  Like people forget how lucky Minnesota was to get 13 wins or how the giants were
*  fortunate in the beginning of the year and how unfortunate New England was.
*  I mean, the punt block in Minnesota, the stupid play against the Raiders.
*  I mean, they're in so many games that, you know, look at the end of the year, the
*  difference between 12 and five and five and 12 are about 12 plays and all those
*  12 plays went against New England.
*  And so they're eight and nine.
*  And so I think that the guy is going to coach the team, Bill O'Brien.
*  I think that the most important thing they did this off season is get a line coach.
*  I mean, Patricia was also coaching the line.
*  That line play was horrendous.
*  People say, well, you got to get a receiver for Mack Jones.
*  No, if you get Mack Jones a little bit of time, maybe he could throw the ball and
*  not turn it over.
*  Like he was getting a shit kicked out of him.
*  And I think that'll improve.
*  They had no receivers who could catch the ball and then run with it for more than a
*  yard and a half, right?
*  The entire team, the offensive line was, was really, really atypically bad for a
*  Belichick team and the strategy stuff was horrific.
*  But I thought they had a lot of talent.
*  Like I look at the defense now, if they hit with the, with the second round pick and
*  they hit with Gonzalez, which it seems like everybody's just penciling him, he's
*  going to play like they're actually kind of loaded on defense now.
*  Plus they fixed the kicking game.
*  That was another thing we didn't mention.
*  Jake Bailey was the worst punter of all time last year.
*  Right.
*  And they, they finally got a punter and they have a kicker just in case folk
*  finally, you know, it's been done for him.
*  But I just think they're deep.
*  I do too.
*  And I think that this map, he, the kid, they drafted from Sac State in the third
*  round gives them a box player that can tackle big guys like Josh Allen and defend
*  the six-pack attack, which they've struggled with.
*  And then when you look at them on, you know, offensively Stevenson is a
*  legitimate big time running back.
*  I mean, this guy, I mean, if he can protect the football, that's another game
*  that we didn't even talk about.
*  They're going to beat Cincinnati and he fumbles the ball going in the, I mean,
*  we've got the ball inside the five yard line and he fumbles it and loses that game.
*  So it was very uncharacteristic.
*  I can't see that happen in two years in a row.
*  Yeah, I don't either.
*  And I, you know, they're plus seven 50 for the division, which I also think
*  seemed a little crazy because it goes back to the bills thing.
*  I, I just feel like the bills getting pretty big benefit of the doubt at this
*  point, and they should be the favorites.
*  But then I look at Miami and say, I don't know how many more games two is going
*  to play at three concussions last year.
*  Then I look at the jets.
*  Um, I don't know when Bruce Hall is coming back.
*  Well, I don't know about, I don't know about the coach.
*  We haven't seen him actually like coaching a real playoff team.
*  I have no idea what's going to happen with Rogers.
*  I didn't like how he looked last year.
*  So there's a scenario where they're really good, but there's also a
*  scenario where it's disappointing and it feels like the Mets season right now.
*  Where all the Mets fans are like, what happened?
*  I thought we were going to be awesome.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, look, the, the, the offensive line is still an issue.
*  I mean, Miami just signed Isaiah Wynn.
*  I mean, if you think, if you, if you're worried about concussion protocol, I'm
*  not sure you want to sign Isaiah Wynn.
*  Get over your left tackle.
*  So the Miami has severe law offensive line issues that they've got to fix.
*  Or else two is going to get hit again.
*  And that's going to be problematic, but look, it's wide open.
*  I think every, when is there ever been a time where on paper it goes
*  the way it thinks on paper?
*  Never does.
*  Well, the one thing that we know for sure is that the NFC is not talented enough,
*  which means at least from like an over under division type of thing, that's
*  where the real inefficiencies are going to be right.
*  NFC South, something weird happened to NFC North, maybe Seattle right now.
*  To me, Seattle looks like what Philly was like last year where it started out.
*  Dallas was the favorites and Philly was like plus 200.
*  And then Philly started creeping toward them.
*  And by that time, what do we hit August?
*  Philly was the favorites in the division.
*  People started looking at their schedule.
*  Like, wait a second.
*  If they get past week two, it's like smooth sailing after that.
*  Um, so I, I, I'm, I have my eye on Seattle as like maybe still some value there.
*  I said this on my show and pot.
*  I would bet overs in the NFC, unders in the AFC.
*  Oh, good one.
*  Who's your favorite quarterback right now?
*  Still my homes.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's hard to argue with them.
*  I mean, Burrow to me has that it factor, you know, that ability to win, you know,
*  this is one of the key things that I think Bryce Young has too, is that ability
*  to play with instincts and awareness around you.
*  The bird factor, the magic, the great players have that.
*  And when you sit down and talk to them about a game, they can remember
*  the game like it was yesterday.
*  I mean, I told this story, Bill Russell's wife bought him a video of him in the
*  56 and C2A game against LaSalle.
*  And he sat down at 86 years old and he watched it and he knew every play.
*  He knew every player knew every play.
*  He thought he was 21.
*  Great players have that instinct.
*  And to me, Burrows got that.
*  I have a hard time doubting them.
*  And I think Amoromo is a really good defensive coordinator.
*  And if they could run the ball more and get a little bit, let them help him out
*  and take some pressure off, I think it would really, people say, well, you
*  can't run the ball.
*  I agree, but you have to pace the game.
*  You got to pace the game a little bit because when the, when the quarterback's
*  got to throw it 50 times, something bad is going to happen.
*  So you would have Mahomes and Burrow.
*  Who else is on that top, top tier for you before we go?
*  Is it, is it like six or two?
*  I love Herbert, but I can't put, you know, it means Stanley is, you know,
*  for me, it's just so hard.
*  I think Jalen hurts in the six back offense is really hard to defend.
*  You know, it never has to throw the drop back passes, right?
*  He never has to do that because they play from in front.
*  I mean, they had a plus one 75 first half point differential last year.
*  You know, I love Herbert's talent, you know, but to me, there's something
*  missing about that team.
*  It's to me, it's that toughness factor with, with the chargers.
*  They can't stop the run, you know, and I think that that's problematic, but, you
*  know, and look without Brady and Rogers, I mean, you know, Jared Goff is actually
*  one of the top quarterbacks in the NFC.
*  I know it's hilarious.
*  I thought Peyton was going to wait for that charger's job.
*  Cause I, I just couldn't imagine that Stanley was going to be more than another
*  year, but he obviously just wanted to coach again.
*  He loved it then Denver threw a shit load of money at him.
*  Well, I think D'Amico turning that job down cause he wasn't going to get that
*  job if D'Amico took it and he took Houston instead.
*  And so I think he realized, you know, I better take this now because if I waited
*  meant maybe something doesn't happen.
*  I think coaches get a little worried about that.
*  They better take one if not.
