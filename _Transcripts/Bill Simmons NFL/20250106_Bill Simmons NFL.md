# How the Patriots Stupidly Blew Their Shot at the First Pick  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [January 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA)
*  Unfortunately, my team, one of the most devastating days in the history of the franchise. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=0.0s)]
*  Come on. Come on. Maybe it wasn't. No, but it was when I think of like the dark dumb days [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=8.24s)]
*  in the history of the team since I became a Patriots fan with Jim Plunkett and Mack [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Heron and everybody when I was like four years old, this has to be in the top eight or nine. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=19.44s)]
*  It's just a complete organizational collapse, disgrace. It made no sense. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Made no sense as it was happening. Every other team, the fucking chiefs knew how to tank. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=31.28s)]
*  Right. The chiefs are like, here's Carson Wentz just handing the ball off and then we're going [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=36.72s)]
*  to bring in our third string quarterback. I don't know what to tell you. So I don't know. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  I don't know. We had the first pick and now we have the fourth pick. We moved back three spots [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=47.92s)]
*  every single round. Right. And one of my friends texted me, it was like we traded the first pick [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=54.64s)]
*  for the fourth pick and got nothing in the trade. Right. And we moved back three spots every round. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=61.92s)]
*  It was one. And we gave up all these potential assets that came with the pick. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=69.36s)]
*  And the thing that kills me is they fire the coach right after the game. They knew they were going [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=72.8s)]
*  to do that for at least a week. So you're letting this guy make the, basically he's trying to win [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=77.84s)]
*  and the offensive coordinator, they're trying to win because they don't know if they're going to be [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=83.84s)]
*  there. They're trying to coach for their jobs. You got to get rid of those guys. If you know, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=86.72s)]
*  you're going to get rid of them after the game. Why not get rid of them before the game? Why not [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  put this decision in the hands of people who care about the big long-term picture of the franchise [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  instead of trying to win the game? All right. I'll give you that. Maybe they should have fired [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=101.76s)]
*  them before the game, but I just, I know people who root for bad teams and then they just never [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=106.72s)]
*  end up rooting for their team. They just end up rooting for draft picks year after year and they [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  just never get to root for their team. This is three hours. It's three hours of my life. I never [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=115.76s)]
*  have to think about this game again. The whole last month you were thinking about it. Yeah. Well, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=119.84s)]
*  what was the year Lovey Smith did this? What was it? Two years ago? Yeah. I think it was two. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=124.72s)]
*  He was just like, yeah, fuck it. And he ends up, and he was gone. Yeah. Yeah. And he was gone. And [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=128.4s)]
*  he left that team with a nice shining turret on the sidelines. Well, I mean, let's put a pin in [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=133.52s)]
*  this already. Like tanking kind of just doesn't exist in the NFL because like, first of all, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=138.08s)]
*  three teams were in line for the number one pick in the last three weeks. They all won. The Rangers, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  the Giants and the Patriots. No, but in the last three weeks, all those teams had won. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=147.52s)]
*  Tennessee knew the job today. Cleveland knew the job yesterday. It's three hours. I don't think it [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  looked good for a quarter. It's like, all right, you got to go. Joe, how many quarterbacks do you [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  think you have? Joe Milton's your best quarterback. Kyle, Joe Milton was fantastic. I would have [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=161.6s)]
*  started both rookie receivers, the guys who have had no catches all year. Drake may, they at least [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=166.72s)]
*  figured that out, but that took five days for them to figure out. But here's how I would explain it [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=172.72s)]
*  to somebody who didn't know anything about this. If you owned a company and you had, I don't know, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=177.76s)]
*  hundreds of people that worked for the company and you had the single biggest decision of the year [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=185.12s)]
*  for that company that had the most financial and business implications possible. And you gave it to, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  I don't know, let's say your friend Harry is the president and you're like, I know I'm firing Harry [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=196.72s)]
*  next week. I know I'm going to fire him on Sunday night and this decision is going to be Sunday [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=200.48s)]
*  morning. Should I just let Harry make this decision for the company right before I fire him? Or should [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=207.68s)]
*  I try to figure out with other people who are going to be here next year, what the best decision [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=213.2s)]
*  is? You know what? I'll let Harry do it and then I'll fire him right after. It makes no sense. No [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=218.0s)]
*  normal business operates this way. You don't turn over the biggest decision of your year. It's not, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=222.56s)]
*  this was normal. You just shouldn't have hired Harry in the first place is what I would say to you. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=227.6s)]
*  But it's like, and you got people paying to watch this business. All of them are rooting for them to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  lose. I don't know. I don't know. Not Kyle. He's got the Joe Milton Jersey. Kyle was devastated. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=237.84s)]
*  Kyle was the most upset of anyone I was texting with during the game other than my dad. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=244.32s)]
*  You have to trade Drake May. Of course he's devastated. Yeah. They had, I don't know, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  they were in the catbird seat. They already have a franchise QB. They're going to have the number [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=253.12s)]
*  one pick, but like by within two hours, we're like, wow, the two QBs, nobody even likes them [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=257.36s)]
*  that much in this draft. Maybe we couldn't have gotten that much for them anyway. It's just, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=261.76s)]
*  it just speaks to what this whole season was like, which was owners who don't know what they're [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=265.92s)]
*  doing, a front office that don't know what they're doing and a coach who had no idea what he was [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=270.48s)]
*  doing and contradicted himself over and over again, starting in August when he was like, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=274.24s)]
*  it's going to be a competition for this job. Then starts reset, even though May was better. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=278.96000000000004s)]
*  And then four weeks in, he's like, well, May was playing better. So he's got to start. It's like, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  but wait, you, you actually said that wasn't what we were, but now and it was just contradictions [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=286.88s)]
*  left and right. And he deserved to be fired. Listen, that's fine. But now you have three [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=292.16s)]
*  coaches in the last three years. You're like the Panthers with the one and Duns. Congrats. You're [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=296.56s)]
*  rude for the New England Panthers. And now it's like, you can't talk about Patriot lore and well, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=300.72s)]
*  we have, we have grit and we're going to go, we have staying power and all that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  You're like everybody else. I know we're like everybody else, but we had a chance to have a [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  franchise QB and the number one pick in the draft. You got, it's three hours out of your life. Like, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=314.64000000000004s)]
*  we do this all the time in basketball. It's like, oh, these two weeks are going to suck, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=321.12s)]
*  but it's all going to be worth it. Cause we'll be in this spot after it's done. This was three hours. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=324.48s)]
*  I think it's very difficult to get tanking to work in the NFL. You have to have the coaching staff, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=328.64s)]
*  the players and the front office on the same page. Maybe the giants did it today. Exactly. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=334.64s)]
*  They didn't do it in the last two weeks and the NBA. It's as easy as checking in at the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=339.52s)]
*  score table. This is different. It's just different. It just is. But you just, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  you just laid out exactly what the problem was. You need to have the players, the coaching staff [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=347.84s)]
*  in the front up. Well, the players are going to do whatever they're trying. They're always going to [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=352.4s)]
*  play. They're not going to do what they're always going to try. Yeah. You need the coach, the front [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=355.28s)]
*  office and the owners all to be on the same page. And when they're not on the same page, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=358.71999999999997s)]
*  dumb shit like today happens because you have coaches who have different motivations for what's [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=363.92s)]
*  best for those three hours than the front office and the owners. And my, so some people were like, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=369.84s)]
*  do you think he fired Mayo because they were supposed to lose that game and they didn't? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=375.6s)]
*  I think they knew they were firing them the whole week. They had like this long statement ready, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=380.16s)]
*  you know, an hour and a half after the game. But this is just, this is what the whole, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=385.68s)]
*  really the whole year has been like dating back to the Apple doc, dating back to this process of [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=391.04s)]
*  hiring a coach that was never a coordinator before, not really hiring a GM, not spending money. And [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=395.12s)]
*  this was the worst team in the league that somehow doesn't have the worst pick. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=401.44s)]
*  But take me through it. What's involved in losing today? Like the Bills play Josh Allen, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=404.8s)]
*  one play, right? Or one series, whatever. So the Bills bring in Trebesky. Trebesky is like actually [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=409.04s)]
*  pretty good. And they're like, all right, gotta get, the Bills wanted us to win. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=414.08s)]
*  They bring in Mike White and they're just spinning the ball up over the middle so they can give the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=418.0s)]
*  ball back to us. So it's a staring contest. So like, maybe, I don't know, you know, it wasn't [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=422.08000000000004s)]
*  like you started everybody. You were throwing bombs every play. It was just a weird, weird game. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=426.8s)]
*  Joe Milton was great. And by the way, kudos to Joe Milton. He was awesome. This was his one chance [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=431.6s)]
*  to shine. Yeah, he's your guy. And he was really good. But this is really why you need a fourth [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=436.40000000000003s)]
*  quarterback. This is where you need a Bailey Zappi. You need a Nathan Peterby. You can take a knee [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=440.56s)]
*  every play, but whatever. Well, but this is when the offensive coordinator is not on the same page. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=448.0s)]
*  And it's like, just, can you just keep handing the ball off and have guys run into the middle line? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=452.64000000000004s)]
*  Can we just keep doing that for a while? Week 18 sucks. Let's just say that. We could just agree [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=456.88s)]
*  on that. And every year I'm like, I'm never betting on this again. And then I bet on it. I had Buffalo. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=462.0s)]
*  I also had Houston because I loved Houston. You lost your wise wager. Yeah, I sat my starters. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=466.64s)]
*  I bet Tennessee. I was like, they're two and 14 against the spread. And that's why I got to warm [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=472.64s)]
*  up for the playoffs. So I'm not starting anyone. But I felt like today was like a little bit of an [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=477.28s)]
*  outer body experience. We're used to the 1pm slate being kind of shit, right? But we saw so [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=481.92s)]
*  many backups today. It reminded me like of a high school reunion where you're like in the corner of [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=486.96000000000004s)]
*  the room, like you're sipping cheap wine and staring at name tags like, Oh, there's Marcus [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=491.84000000000003s)]
*  Mariotta and Trey Lance. Oh, wow. Jimmy G. What's he up to? I'm going to go over and talk to him. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=496.32s)]
*  Yeah. Jimmy, Jimmy, you still living in Los Angeles? Yeah. What's up with the divorce? And then [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=503.36s)]
*  Davis Mills corners you and spends like 20 minutes showing you pictures of his vintage Chevy. And [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=509.68s)]
*  you're like, all right, I'm good. I'm good. Let's get to the playoffs already. This sucks. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=513.68s)]
*  Who is that? Bailey Zappi? Yeah. Yeah. That's the whole weekend. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=518.32s)]
*  It's great. Shepter's reported there's a trade. The Pats have traded down from the first to the [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=523.2s)]
*  fourth pick and they've dropped three spots and every round after that in return for jack shit. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=531.36s)]
*  Got nothing. Got zero to do that. I haven't seen the specs on jack shit. I'll have to see a linebacker [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=538.48s)]
*  from the quarterback. He's a quarterback. Under size. All right. There's your four quarterbacks. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=546.0s)]
*  Kyle said, get your jack shit jersey because that's what we traded the first pick for. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=551.6s)]
*  One thing I was thinking, I mean, at least they realized that they don't have the coach [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=558.24s)]
*  and they got rid of poor Mayo who, you know, was put in an impossible spot. He didn't know [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=562.0s)]
*  how to be a head coach. But I was looking at the coaches who made the playoffs, Andy Reed, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=566.96s)]
*  Kevin O'Connell, Tomlin, both our boss, Peyton McDermott, Dan Campbell, Matt LaFleur, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=574.4000000000001s)]
*  D'Amico Ryan's, and then Dan Quinn, Todd Bowles and Sirianni as the last three. Those are probably [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=581.9200000000001s)]
*  the shakiest three out of all the playoff coaches. It's pretty good batch. That just makes me think [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=588.0s)]
*  like coaches and QBs. What you, if you could just figure out those two things, you're probably good. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=593.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good, that's a good starting point. I'm hoping love is a hundred percent. I'm hoping [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=597.76s)]
*  hurts is a hundred percent. So we don't waste a couple of games in there, but yeah, it seems like [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=602.3199999999999s)]
*  all the quarterbacks, most of them will be solid. Yeah. I think variable is probably the favorite [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=606.64s)]
*  because he was Patriots hall of Famer and I think he wants a job and he has a relationship with [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=612.72s)]
*  Kraft and he's a fucking awesome coach. And I can't believe nobody, I can't believe he's available. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=617.84s)]
*  I don't know why somebody has it already hired him, but you think he used the jets to nudge [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=623.44s)]
*  the Patriots firing today? No question. Well, that's probably the bigger reason they fired Mayo [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=627.6800000000001s)]
*  then today. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cause he's five teams are going to want him at Flores would be [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=633.2800000000001s)]
*  interesting too, because he has Patriots DNA was with the team, really good coach, coach somewhere [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=637.6s)]
*  else. So would it be his first job? Those would be my top two, but variable, I always thought, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=645.2s)]
*  I just always thought variable was a top seven, top eight coach. You'll be in good shape if you [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=650.88s)]
*  get him jack shit's a high school coach is his name is in the hat. Well, that's the thing. And [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=655.36s)]
*  once you have jack shit, do you get jack shit's college coach? Doesn't matter who coaches bring [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=659.84s)]
*  a man. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0B4Y14dIA&t=664.48s)]
