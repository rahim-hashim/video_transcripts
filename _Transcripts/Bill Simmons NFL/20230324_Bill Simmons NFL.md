# Are the Lions Favorites to Win NFC North Next Year? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [March 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEyYUV2PLMI)
*  Um, the Detroit Lions, man.
*  The hype.
*  This offseason.
*  That was my next one. Great one.
*  Everybody, myself included, loving what they're doing in free agency.
*  I'm pretty confident they're the current favorites to win the NFC North right now.
*  Bill, you said you looked at the odds, right?
*  So I texted Sal and a couple of other of our friends because I was stunned that they were plus 130.
*  I actually thought they're going to be like minus 150, something like that.
*  They have the sixth and the 18th picks on top of all the stuff that in free agency.
*  And they went nine and eight last year and that division stinks.
*  Like why wouldn't they be like legitimate favorites?
*  Yeah.
*  So many things go working in their favor.
*  Jameson Williams coming back with even play in the offense, which I think finished top five in DVA.
*  And then perhaps equally importantly, they bring back Ben Johnson, their offensive coordinator,
*  doing something that I have always advocated for teams to do, which is spend everything on your
*  assistance. You can just throw money at them.
*  I think there are other reasons why he stayed, but maybe he didn't like the jobs and whatever.
*  But clearly the dude got a raise and he is awesome.
*  So that was so you're saying the Patriot strategy of relatives and washed up other coaches
*  working out of position is a bad strategy.
*  Joe Judge got promoted today. I saw it. Right.
*  He got a great new game.
*  So fired up for special teams.
*  And then the other thing is, and this is the free agency stuff really,
*  such the glaring weakness of the team was the past defense, worst QBR in the NFL,
*  worst in a bunch of categories.
*  They went out and they completely remade their secondary aggressively too,
*  because they tried to get Jaylen Ramsey, which was the other service team I think that one.
*  But they miss on him.
*  So they sign a bunch of kind of like your favorite cornerbacks,
*  cornerback guys like Cam Sutton, Emmanuel Mosley coming out the injury people that
*  football people just love.
*  And then they get CJ Gardner Johnson, who has familiarity with their defensive coordinator,
*  Aaron Glenn, on a really, really cheap deal, which now at number six,
*  they're like in pole position to do a million different things.
*  So love their offseason, love them as division favorites, love the Lions.
*  Danny, I'm just going to say it.
*  They probably have one of the four best quarterbacks in the conference.
*  If Roger sleeves.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  Name me four, four that you would rather have in the NFC than I guess you would take Gino, Dak, Kurtz.
*  I'm trying to decide if Stafford is.
*  Cousins?
*  Yeah.
*  No, Stafford.
*  Stafford is tough right now.
*  I can't tell if he can throw or not, which is obviously important.
*  Would you rather have Goff or Cousins at this point?
*  That's tough.
*  I'd rather have Goff.
*  Goff played surprisingly well last year.
*  I think I would probably pick Cousins just by a hair.
*  But I mean, if we're even discussing it, I think that's notable that because like we had given up on Goff
*  and in this offense, like I don't know if he was necessarily elevating everyone around him,
*  but he was delivering the football on time.
*  He's doing kind of what he did earlier in his career with the Rams and running the offense to
*  like the way that you can run it with like you're getting the ball to your
*  playmakers, letting them do the work.
*  So I thought he took some hits too, which was the rap on him earlier on in his career
*  that you could hit him a couple of times and he was like, yeah, yeah.
*  I like that team.
*  I mean, the Jameson Williams is a great point because they're going to have the sixth and
*  the 18th pick, but then they also get him who's almost like a redshirt freshman in college or
*  something. They trotted him out.
*  I had him in fantasy last year, so I was kind of like, I wonder if he would only play like 10 plays,
*  but they would always run one play a game where he just got wide open 50 yards down the field,
*  beating people by 10 yards.
*  He was my favorite wide receiver in the draft when he was healthy at Alabama.
*  But I mean, OK, so Lions fans love Jared Gaff, so they don't love it when you say this.
*  So I'm almost afraid to say it.
*  This would be such a good landing spot for Anthony Richardson at six.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Six for a year.
*  Right.
*  Perfect place. Great offense. Great place to learn.
*  And then you get to tap into that upside that he provides.
*  I would love that for him.
*  I thought you were going to say Lamar there because that was Sheila Capadia was his big.
*  Also interesting.
*  Why wouldn't the Lions trade for.
*  Because I think they could do the 18th pick, not the sixth, right?
*  When you get to pick your pick.
*  So yeah.
*  For the Lamar six.
*  Trade 18 and next year's first and other stuff and then pay Lamar.
*  But I don't think they have to. I think they're in a great spot.
*  I was stunned that they were still plus money as a favorite because Green Bay is going to go the
*  other way.
*  I don't the Bears.
*  I just need to see Fields have a game where he's like 25 for 35 or something.
*  They just didn't throw the ball at all last year.
*  I have no idea what to make of them.
*  And they feel like they're maybe a year away from being whoever they are.
*  And then Minnesota looks like a mess.
*  And it looks like they're kind of a stealth candidate to maybe trade cousins.
*  If once we get past the draft and quarterback roulette slows down.
*  Danny, is that inconceivable?
*  No, I think.
*  Let's say the Jets Rogers thing just falls apart.
*  The Jets like, shit, we need a quarterback.
*  I don't know.
*  Could be cousins.
*  I'm not positive he's going to be in that team.
*  I mean, cousins is the hired gun of veteran quarterbacks at this point.
*  Like he did the thing where he got he bet on himself and he made tons and tons of money.
*  It doesn't really feel like the Vikings love him.
*  Like they've sort of slipped up several times talking about like how they don't really buy him.
*  It's like a long term solution.
*  I mean, I don't know if that's like, you know, it's pretty much acknowledged and everyone agrees with that.
*  But like you don't say it, right?
*  Like if you're the team, you don't say that even though they have a couple of times.
*  So I thought that was a little bit funny.
*  So yeah, it does feel like they're not they don't look at him as like this is our guy.
*  It's just kind of like he's here for now.
*  Lions were nine and eight last year.
*  So to me, they have the kind of feel of the Eagles last year where the Eagles was just sitting there
*  and everybody was staring at it and everybody was going, Jalen hurts like that was like the hiccup.
*  Right. And then they kept adding people and then their odds started to shift and they became like
*  the sexy pick and it kept shifting.
*  And then all of a sudden they were favored ahead of Dallas.
*  Goff is kind of the hiccup for this for the case for them.
*  And also like, you know, Dan Campbell, the game management stuff, there were some hiccups is
*  I would use the word again.
*  But I find it hard to believe they're not two wins better this year, like 11 and six seems pretty
*  reasonable either way.
*  This is probably the most exciting spot the Lions have been in since I can't even remember.
