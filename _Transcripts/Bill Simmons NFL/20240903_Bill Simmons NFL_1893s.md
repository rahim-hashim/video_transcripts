# NFL Guess the Lines Week 1 With Cousin Sal  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdSlvsJuzv0)
*  All right, it's time.
*  Guess the lines.
*  Week one,
*  2024.
*  And because gambling lines are so omnipresent,
*  and I don't know how I do it,
*  but I genuinely avoid them all through the summer.
*  And then once we got to like about eight, nine days ago,
*  I was like, not only do I wanna see the lines,
*  cause I wanna bet a couple things early,
*  but I know I'm gonna end up seeing them.
*  So I sent you a bunch of guesses.
*  So tell us specifically why you had to see them,
*  because you're like, I gotta bet against the Patriots.
*  That Bengals teaser isn't gonna be there much longer.
*  I wanted to put the Pats in the tease.
*  The preseason made me so bad.
*  I'm just not betting against them in week one.
*  And by the way, I feel no guilt about it.
*  I want the Pats to be bad this year.
*  Anyway, every year since 2007,
*  so this is our 18th year together,
*  we've been guessing the lines.
*  This started in, well, you started even earlier than me.
*  What was it with Darren?
*  With the parlay kid, yeah, we used to do it in college.
*  He used to hide in the closet,
*  so his girlfriend, now wife,
*  didn't hear him talking gambling.
*  But yeah, so now here we are.
*  18 years.
*  Yeah, so when I moved to LA,
*  I moved to LA in 2002,
*  we had desks next to each other
*  in the Jimmy Kimmel Live offices, which are still there.
*  And then week one, we got the USA Todays out.
*  We did Guess the Lines.
*  And then I left the show
*  and we would just do it on the phone.
*  And I think I have in a column from somewhere,
*  I was like, this would be the greatest radio show,
*  me and Sal guessing the lines.
*  I sound like I'm insane.
*  But when I got the podcast in 2007,
*  that fall, we immediately started with Guess the Lines.
*  Yeah, you said greatest radio show.
*  I was like, no, no, podcast.
*  You're like, what is that?
*  I'm like, pod, what?
*  Then I explained to you, I was like,
*  look, it's gonna turn out good for you.
*  So, all right.
*  So this podcast has a lot of history.
*  We've done it all over the place.
*  It was the podcast that got me suspended
*  from ESPN for three weeks,
*  which I'm still mad about.
*  10 year anniversary coming up.
*  Anyway, we Guess the Lines.
*  I usually win.
*  I don't know, remember the last time you've won.
*  I don't know.
*  I, you know, this is,
*  I haven't been here in a while.
*  I don't think so.
*  And I feel like I'm ready though.
*  I lost a lot on college football yesterday.
*  Screw you, Texas A&M.
*  Oh good, congrats.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's like when you overeat appetizers
*  and I still have like a strip steak coming.
*  It's like, all right, I'll put it away.
*  But let's do it.
*  Thursday night.
*  Opening night in Kansas City.
*  The Kansas City Chiefs are playing the Baltimore Ravens.
*  And I guessed minus four for this game.
*  And what did you have?
*  I had minus four as well.
*  And it's minus three.
*  So we tie.
*  Should we stop now?
*  We just tied.
*  So what are the reasons?
*  Why do you think this dropped?
*  You know, this Thursday game was almost always
*  an automatic four for the favorite,
*  for the incumbent, you know?
*  And now it's like, your team kind of ruined it.
*  You beat the Chiefs on the road,
*  or the Chiefs beat you on the road, right?
*  Patriots was a Thursday night game years ago.
*  Last year it was three and a half against the Lions
*  and they lost the Chiefs.
*  So it's obviously not the end of the world,
*  but I don't know why there would be
*  a lot of Ravens backers here.
*  The last four years,
*  they kind of started messing around it in the late 2010s.
*  And then this decade,
*  they've gone back to having the Super Bowl champ
*  host the first game.
*  Detroit beat KC by one last year.
*  Buffalo killed the Rams 31 to 10.
*  The Bucs beat Dallas by two, but did not cover.
*  That was a really fun game.
*  And then KC in 2021 beat Houston 34-20.
*  They're the only team that's covered in the last four years.
*  Right.
*  So this used to be an automatic.
*  Something shifted.
*  I guess the question for me is Ravens revenge game,
*  or should we be worried about the Ravens game?
*  Cause it feels like it's gone one way or the other.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's my one only thing with the Chiefs over wins
*  and one seed.
*  Like they now know they can win on the road.
*  They now know they don't have to win the first game.
*  They could be like, you know, 11 and six after.
*  So nothing really bothers them, but you're right.
*  This is a test for the Ravens.
*  They get beat up here.
*  You think, wow, that's a tough AMC North.
*  They have to go through after this.
*  Do you think this is the last chance this week
*  to grab Mahomes futures?
*  Almost like when, you know, like whatever that Amazon day is,
*  or when you go on some website,
*  it's like 50% off next two days.
*  And then everything goes back to full price
*  and you go back there, you go in a store and it's like,
*  oh, fuck, I should have gotten that shirt.
*  Cause the, all the Mahomes, the MVP,
*  anything involving him is the best price
*  you're ever gonna get right now.
*  Yeah.
*  And he gets, he has a billion prime time games.
*  I think we said they play every day this,
*  every day of the week, except Wednesday this year.
*  So yeah, you're right.
*  His visibility is higher than anybody else's.
*  So what is it still plus four 50
*  usually get six to one for MVP.
*  Yeah. You you've said this every year.
*  That just bet my homes for MVP.
*  It's basically like a mutual fund.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  It'll work.
*  Friday night, we're going to Brazil.
*  Wow.
*  There were some weird internet rumors
*  about this game over the weekend
*  that it might be canceled because of the smog
*  that then turned out to be misinformation.
*  Go figure.
*  Oh really?
*  But, but we have the Eagles and the Packers
*  on a Friday night in Brazil.
*  The NFL has crossed a line that I,
*  they always said they would never cross.
*  We never want to go against high school football.
*  Friday night is sacred.
*  We're never going to do it.
*  And
*  Goodell's imperialism is like, F this.
*  We waited around you high school kids.
*  You can play, you can play Wednesday if you want.
*  Sorry guys.
*  Yeah. He's basically, Goodell is Ted DiBiase now.
*  Right.
*  He's like, everyone's got a price.
*  Friday night, eight o'clock in Brazil, cut me a check.
*  Like, do you think the NFL will play a game in Abu Dhabi
*  in the next three years?
*  Cause my bet would be yes.
*  Maybe not three, but yeah.
*  Yeah. I'm sure they'd have to figure it out.
*  That's, cause I heard the team USA played two games
*  over there and got like 40 million for the team USA program.
*  Those two basketball games they played.
*  The boxing is going over there all the time.
*  UFC like anywhere in Saudi Arabia.
*  And I just, at some point Goodell's not going to be able
*  to turn it down.
*  Yeah. There's no way.
*  Well, I mean, you know, so the Europe thing,
*  we know for sure they're trying to get a team in there.
*  Right.
*  Yeah. We're like a little four team division or something.
*  Yeah. Something's going on.
*  Doing that with South America too.
*  Well, we're going to, is that the,
*  cause then I would think Abu Dhabi might just be a waste, but.
*  Well, I'm just, it should be a straight paycheck.
*  They're like, here's $300 million for one game.
*  Anyway, Eagles Packers and my pick was Eagles minus one and a half
*  over the Packers.
*  What'd you have?
*  I went slightly higher.
*  I said two and it's two and a half.
*  So you hit that one.
*  Listen, I always win the first week and it doesn't matter,
*  but I want a big Dom.
*  I don't know if big Dom's ready for the handle,
*  the hooliganism in Brazil, the Eagles,
*  remember the security guy, he's back.
*  Then you get like a,
*  He's back.
*  Or a raise, he got like promoted or something.
*  Got a slap on the swollen wrist in his back.
*  It's like assistant GM or something crazy now.
*  I thought the more I stared at this game
*  and the only reason I could see the Eagles being minus two
*  and a half was they're pretty good.
*  They're six and oh in their last two September's.
*  Green Bay's got banged up running backs.
*  People were worried about.
*  Other than that, I have these two teams even in my head
*  and I don't know why this isn't a pick them.
*  I know I'm gonna end up talking myself into Packers.
*  I think there's some T stuff with them.
*  Maybe bringing them back to plus eight and a half,
*  but this would violate my rule.
*  I told you I was gonna do five days ago.
*  Don't bet on any of these fucking games.
*  I read this story about AJ Brown was saying,
*  like I'm just not leaving my hotel room.
*  I'm not leaving the entire time we're there.
*  Like weird shit happens when you go to these countries.
*  So I don't, these are hard to bet on.
*  This is a bad deal for Philly,
*  especially if they lose obviously,
*  but they, I don't know.
*  You wanna give up one of your home games
*  and go to Brazil against a good team to start off?
*  Right.
*  It's, I mentioned Texas A&M, but it's like, hey,
*  watch what everybody's doing.
*  They're 40 point favorites.
*  All these college powerhouses.
*  Just don't play anyone good the first couple of weeks.
*  Right.
*  Don't play in Brazil.
*  Our Sunday marquee game.
*  Oh, by the way, Brazil banned Twitter.
*  Right.
*  So anyone who covers this game won't be able to tweet.
*  So I don't know how we're all gonna survive.
*  We're gonna find out what happens.
*  No way.
*  Now I'm gonna have to actually watch the game
*  instead of Twitter.
*  Sunday marquee game could have gone in a lot of directions,
*  but you know, it's your team.
*  Tom Brady's announcing for the first time ever.
*  Right.
*  It's the Sean Watson against Dak.
*  There's injured guys on both sides.
*  Cleveland's not gonna have Nick Chubb.
*  They're not gonna have a left tackle.
*  They might have more offensive line injuries.
*  You don't have bland.
*  Cleveland's D was really good at home last year.
*  13.9 points per game at home.
*  29.6 on the road.
*  Your team has a big bullseye on it.
*  Everyone's talking.
*  Always.
*  Yep.
*  And I think it's the marquee game.
*  Right?
*  That's fine.
*  I'll take that.
*  In Cleveland. There are some others
*  I'm interested in, but yeah.
*  In Cleveland, Browns, Cowboys,
*  and I have the Cowboys favored by one and a half
*  over the Browns.
*  Well, I hit this exactly.
*  You forgot to implement the Cowboys tax.
*  You'll remember.
*  You'll remember.
*  It's two and a half, and I said two and a half,
*  but you just gotta think the big money
*  isn't coming in on the Browns just yet, even at home.
*  I think that's fair.
*  Two and a half.
*  Although I could see Cleveland stealing this too.
*  Here's the problem with betting Cleveland.
*  A, they're not gonna be able to run the ball,
*  but you're like, no, no, Browns, home dog, round one,
*  and then Deshaun sales his first pass over somebody's head,
*  and you're like, what did I do?
*  He's just walking off.
*  To me, this is a stay away.
*  I don't know what to make either of these teams.
*  I don't think I would be betting on this game.
*  I'll be watching it though.
*  It's so bad because I obviously have to defend my Cowboys
*  against people like you and Hench,
*  just cannot see that the regular season's different
*  from postseason, but whatever.
*  And then I have Cleveland to win that division,
*  so I'm gonna bind either way here, but go Cowboys.
*  Yeah, you boxed yourself in.
*  Cowboys minus two and a half.
*  Okay, the watchables.
*  I got three legit watchable games.
*  Now granted, we have a Friday and a Thursday
*  and a Monday game, so we're a little asleep,
*  but first one, it's in Buffalo.
*  The Bills are playing the Cardinals,
*  and I can't wait to watch this game.
*  I think the Cardinals are gonna be super fun to watch.
*  The Bills, you know, Milano's out, secondary's banged up.
*  Seems like a nice spot.
*  I keep staring at that Arizona plus two 15,
*  but when I had to guess this, I guess Bills five and a half
*  over the Cardinals, what'd you have?
*  You got it exactly.
*  I said six and a half.
*  This is the Hal Murray rematch, right?
*  No Hopkins on this team anymore, but yeah,
*  this is a fun one, and I feel like we've grown up
*  because I think we would've been like,
*  oh, teaser, no doubt about it, Buffalo, let's do it.
*  No way.
*  Yeah, either you're teasing the Cardinals
*  or you're just taking the money line, I think, for this one.
*  And also, fully admit, you take Cardinals and whatever,
*  and then it's like, and the Bills, we're back in Buffalo.
*  The Bills are up 27 and nothing.
*  Josh Allen has two touchdowns.
*  He's also throwing for two.
*  And you're like, what did I do?
*  11 inches of snow somehow, first week in September.
*  No one can just get it.
*  Yeah, I feel like that line's gonna go down.
*  I think that goes down to four and a half
*  by the time we get to Sunday,
*  but that's gonna be a really fun one.
*  A lot of fantasy guys in that game, too.
*  Next one is a great game.
*  Could've been in the discussion for the marquee.
*  Texans Colts.
*  We are going to Indianapolis for this one,
*  and I picked the Colts minus one.
*  Yeah, you were off on this one.
*  I was way off.
*  Yeah, I was.
*  I said Texans by one and a half, and even I was off.
*  It's Texans minus two and a half.
*  Yeah, you know what?
*  And I made this pick eight, nine days ago,
*  and since then, there's been just a lot of Texans buzz,
*  including on our podcast, and it was a bad pick by me.
*  Texans are, Colts are 0-9 and one
*  in the last 10 week one games.
*  Not sure if that matters for this,
*  but 0-9 and one.
*  0-9 and one.
*  Wow.
*  Last 10 week one, yep.
*  Couple things going on in this game.
*  I think this is my number one pick
*  for the overreaction game.
*  Whatever happens in this game, massive overreaction, right?
*  Richardson kills Houston, and he's awesome,
*  and they beat Houston.
*  We got, it's just Richardson Day the next day.
*  Houston takes care of business,
*  beats the Colts again in Indy,
*  and CJ Stroud looks awesome.
*  A lot of buzz that way, but then also,
*  Richardson doesn't look good, and then it's like,
*  oh no, Richardson, are we sure he's good?
*  It just feels like whatever happens,
*  there's gonna be an overreaction.
*  People are banged up on both sides here,
*  because Texans pass, Russia's banged up,
*  Indy's got some receivers.
*  Indy didn't change their secondary from last year,
*  which I thought was interesting,
*  because I was reading about the games last year,
*  and they're just like, we're running it back.
*  Even though CJ Stroud did what he wanted against them,
*  but I'm probably gonna bet Houston on this game, by the way.
*  Yeah, well, if it stays under three, right,
*  that might be the way to go.
*  We like them better than the Colts this year, so.
*  Oh, 91 is tough.
*  Here's another one I'm probably gonna bet.
*  Miami home for the Jaguars.
*  I initially picked Dolphins minus four.
*  There's been some injuries on the Dolphin side.
*  What'd you have?
*  I had three and a half, and it's down to three,
*  so I'm gonna bet that.
*  That's a good one.
*  I feel like you're cheating.
*  That's a good one.
*  No, no, no.
*  You're the one who sees the NFL Reddit teams.
*  I don't do any of that.
*  So Miami's missing Chubb, they're missing Odo Beckham,
*  Barrios might have to play third receiver,
*  they're missing their left guard,
*  their D-backs are banged up,
*  Waddle and Tyreek are both questionable right now,
*  but probably playing, and odds are
*  it's gonna be fucking hot there,
*  which it's the Florida team, so they'll be fine,
*  but I'm gonna make a note this year for week one too,
*  because we always forget when it's 85, 90,
*  and 100% humidity, I always remember after the fact,
*  I don't know who that's gonna hurt,
*  but I'm in on the Jags.
*  I could see spending some betty money on them.
*  Yeah, well I don't know who's gonna hurt either,
*  but yeah, when it's like 140% humidity,
*  I don't think you could make it higher than three
*  with two decent teams.
*  No, just don't know.
*  Yeah.
*  Fairly watchables.
*  You could tell me if any of these should have been
*  in the other category, but Bears, Titans I put in there
*  just because Caleb's first game, I'm interested,
*  wanna know how it looks, wanna see if they whip it around.
*  I had the Bears minus three and a half at home
*  against the Titans, would you?
*  I went a little higher, and I win this.
*  I said four, and it's four and a half.
*  Yeah, so we're in the Vega zone.
*  Well, you know, this is the first week,
*  excuse me, of cheating, but I do use the over on the win
*  totals to decide what I'm gonna pick for a line,
*  and the Bears are considerably expected to do better
*  than the Titans, so had to put in the Vega zone.
*  Feels like either Monday morning, Sunday night,
*  Chicago fans over the moon going nuts, how good they looked,
*  or it gets dark immediately.
*  This is another overreaction candidate,
*  but it's only really for the Bears.
*  I don't think anything could happen with the Titans.
*  That would make people crazy, but there's two worlds
*  with the Bears, and one of them is gonna be extreme.
*  Yeah, it's a must-win for the Bears.
*  Yeah, it kinda is.
*  It's a week one must-win.
*  Yeah, it's one of their must-winners.
*  By the way, I know we needed a Friday game
*  to make this work, but eight early, four afternoon,
*  one Sunday night, one Monday.
*  Let's just stick to this, please, when there's no buys.
*  Please, let's stick to this.
*  I think we should have a 10 and a three.
*  That's worse, don't we have a 10 and a three coming up,
*  or a 10 and a two?
*  There's two 10s in there, and it's like,
*  I think Scott Hanson came on, they changed it
*  because of red zone watchers.
*  They're like, well, we can't have two late afternoon games
*  with the red zone.
*  Like, what about us, the old schoolers,
*  who actually watch all of these?
*  Why did it have to take red zone to make a move here anyway?
*  Your game's late, right?
*  Yeah, Cowboys are late afternoon.
*  Yeah, they want people watching, Brady.
*  So next one is Falcon Steelers,
*  which initially I had in the watchables,
*  but the more you read about the Steelers offense,
*  there's a better chance it's gonna be unwatchable.
*  I texted you before, and I was like,
*  if you had one regret, one possible do-over
*  for the Marlboro Underpod.
*  Just Steelers, you said?
*  It seems like everyone's out on the Steelers.
*  What happened between Tuesday and Sunday?
*  Well, their offensive line is, I think, in shambles.
*  Jalen Warren's hurt.
*  This is like, I kinda needed them to win this game
*  as part of my over-under,
*  and it feels like this is a horrible spot for them.
*  They have the Arthur Smith revenge game
*  because he's their offensive coordinator now.
*  But it just feels like their offensive line
*  has kinda passed the point and no return.
*  That was one of the reasons I liked them this season.
*  They drafted, they spent on it,
*  but they've had bad luck all over the place.
*  So this is another overreaction possibility
*  because you can see the Steelers
*  just not being able to do anything.
*  Judon gets a sack, Simmons makes a play,
*  and there's Raheem Morris is jumping around,
*  fist-pumping, and the Falcons win like 30 to three.
*  Cousins is back, the NFC Salads for real.
*  I will say,
*  Pitt might be the nobody who leaves on this team.
*  Everyone's out on them.
*  I think it's just, I think I'm the only one
*  that picked them in the playoffs.
*  If there's anyone else out there who,
*  everyone's out on them.
*  Even on the Ringer pods,
*  the Bundo and Austin Gale on Friday,
*  on the bread zone on Ringer Gambly,
*  just destroying Pittsburgh.
*  On your pod, who likes Pittsburgh?
*  Anybody?
*  You know what it is, I think we talked about it.
*  You look at their schedule,
*  you just can't come up with an error.
*  You can't just do it.
*  There's no two weeks in a row where it's like,
*  oh, okay.
*  So on the other hand, they're gonna be in every game.
*  They just kinda are.
*  They'll get blown out once, maybe twice.
*  Otherwise, it's just a knuckleball,
*  1917 fourth quarter kind of thing.
*  I feel like people are,
*  I still feel like people are glossing over the defense,
*  but you're gonna be asking a lot.
*  Yeah, if it's healthy, they're great.
*  The over-under on this game is 40 and a half.
*  And this game feels so undery to me.
*  Yeah, right.
*  It's just, are the Steelers gonna score,
*  I don't know, 17 points?
*  I don't see it.
*  Okay.
*  We didn't pick it though.
*  We didn't pick the, we didn't do it.
*  Oh, we didn't?
*  We didn't pick it?
*  I think we should've picked it anyway.
*  I had Falcons minus three and a half in it.
*  So I said two and a half and it's three.
*  Okay.
*  It's probably where it should be.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that shifts up by Sunday.
*  I think that ends up at three and a half, don't you?
*  I don't see a lot of Pitt money coming in.
*  Everyone's out on Pitt.
*  All the advanced metrics, they're all like, we're out.
*  I think it stays.
*  I think it stays.
*  Mike Tomlin, I believe in you still.
*  I can't believe you want a Mulligan for our week.
*  I didn't say Mulligan.
*  I said, if I, you know, we're on the record.
*  I'm saying if I could have a Mulligan.
*  I say, all right.
*  I think I would switch Pittsburgh and Buffalo
*  as my playoff team.
*  And I think I would put Buffalo in the playoffs,
*  but I don't have a Mulligan.
*  So I'm going to ride with the Brahmin.
*  Yeah.
*  I know.
*  Chargers, Raiders.
*  Could argue this is a watchable just cause there's so much
*  going on, but I picked, it's in LA,
*  which is usually a good thing for the team.
*  That's the home team.
*  But in this case, the Raiders will probably have
*  40,000 fans there.
*  I am not scared.
*  I have Chargers by two and a half.
*  I got this exactly.
*  I said three and a half.
*  So they don't believe in the, again,
*  I was just going by the old run to win things,
*  but you're right.
*  There's no home advantage at all.
*  It's a disadvantage in this case.
*  This is three and a half.
*  Then I thought it was two and a half.
*  I looked 10 minutes before we went.
*  Oh, it's up to three and a half.
*  Wow.
*  This is a move in the last 12 hours.
*  I didn't check honestly until this morning.
*  I think it moved.
*  This is a Nance Romo game.
*  There's some good storylines for this.
*  Yeah, cause Harbaugh, they played in December
*  and the Raiders beat them 63-21
*  and they ended up firing Staley.
*  That was Easton Stick.
*  They ran it up.
*  And I just, I'm thinking of Harbaugh this whole week,
*  just doing the last time we played these guys,
*  they embarrassed you.
*  Right.
*  That was a Thursday night, but yeah,
*  I thought they'd get a better game,
*  but then you look at it,
*  it's like, I guess nothing else really makes sense.
*  I think Harbaugh's first game is a good game.
*  Yeah.
*  This might be a Chargers defense wins it by itself game.
*  Adams and Bowers are both questionable for the game.
*  You got Harbaugh versus Antonio Pierce.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  That'll be fun.
*  So I like the Chargers.
*  I love every single one of them.
*  Well, you're beating me in guess the lines,
*  which I don't like.
*  That last one is Bucks at home for the Washington commanders.
*  And I bet on Bucks minus three for this one, would you?
*  We both had, oh no, yeah, I had three also.
*  It's three and a half.
*  Yeah.
*  So we tie there.
*  That's tough.
*  So this is a human weather game.
*  What do you mean?
*  If it's in Tampa and it could be a-
*  Oh, human weather.
*  Yeah, this could be one of those,
*  oh my God, not that Washington is a walk in the park anyway,
*  but this is a complete stay away from me.
*  I want to watch Washington for a week.
*  I'm not betting on that.
*  We have no idea how bad their defense is.
*  I'm staying away.
*  I think it's gonna be fun for Jade and Daniels,
*  but I'm not sure about that.
*  It'll be fun.
*  I'll root for them.
*  I don't want money on it.
*  Poopfecta, Bengals versus the Pats.
*  It's in Cincinnati.
*  It's our first Poopfecta game.
*  I have the Cincinnati Bengals by 10.
*  I said nine and it's nine and a half,
*  so we tie that.
*  Split.
*  I'm taking the Patriots and the points.
*  I think Zach Taylor's still vacationing in early September.
*  They got killed by the Browns last year, their first game.
*  They lost to the Steelers.
*  Burrow was hurt.
*  He was hurt.
*  Last year's first game.
*  Over time, two years ago, the Chase even playing.
*  You manipulated Hench to trade him,
*  Jamar Chases in street clothes.
*  Oh, in our keeper league.
*  I did do that.
*  Not sure what's gonna happen.
*  So since he's missing their left tackle
*  and they don't know if they're gonna be missing Chase or not,
*  the Patriots are missing talent on both sides of the ball.
*  I saw that in the injury report.
*  The Patriots are like, we have a good secondary.
*  Does that help us?
*  The talent's not even day to day.
*  They're just out, huh?
*  I don't see a scenario where the Pats hang in this game.
*  Who'd you tease them with?
*  Oh my God. I don't think you ever told me.
*  Who have I not teased them with?
*  No, I.
*  I like them with the Packers.
*  I like the Packers getting points in that Brazil game.
*  I did something with the Lions too.
*  All right.
*  That first one.
*  Anyway.
*  Not bad.
*  Vikings, Giants in New Jersey.
*  I have the Vikings somehow.
*  Maybe the only time this year they'll be favored.
*  Vikings minus one and a half over the Giants.
*  Well, is that what you have?
*  Oh, I thought you said the Giants favorite.
*  Yeah, you get this then.
*  Either way.
*  I had the Giants by two and a half.
*  And you're right.
*  It's the Vikings on the road,
*  favored by one and a half.
*  Can I f this up?
*  No.
*  Who's home?
*  No, the Giants are home.
*  What? What?
*  What's going on?
*  They're not favored?
*  The Giants are home.
*  They stink.
*  And I think part of this is that
*  I don't know if the Giants have a home field advantage.
*  This is very bad news for Danny Dimes
*  if he can't be favored over.
*  Their offensive line not only sucks, but is banged up.
*  Their linebackers are super banged up.
*  Their DBs are bad.
*  So we might have a good Jefferson game.
*  They're gonna be booing Danny Dimes
*  from the moment he shows up.
*  Minnesota's missing Hockinson for four weeks
*  and Addison looks like he's out.
*  But I still like the Vikings.
*  By the way, I would not bet on this game
*  because if you bet on this game,
*  you're betting on Sam Darnold playing
*  in the old Giants stadium.
*  This is a fucking stalemate.
*  Oh, the ghosts and everything.
*  Yeah, you can't do it.
*  I just, the Vikings were,
*  all right, so again, this is how I did the Lions week one.
*  Over seven and a half, Giants six and a half.
*  Giants are home, but you say no home field advantage?
*  And they have more injuries.
*  New logo at midfield?
*  All right.
*  The only thing I would bet on is the New Jersey turf
*  will do something awful in this game.
*  That seems to be a September tradition.
*  The turf eats them.
*  Justin Jefferson again, sorry.
*  We don't need to spend a lot of time on Saints Panthers,
*  which is in New Orleans.
*  A lot of injuries on both ways.
*  Well, the league sent out a memo
*  before we guess a line on this and said,
*  there's no way to bet and win this game.
*  So stay away.
*  There's just no, they went all different ways,
*  but can't do it.
*  Well, I had the Saints minus six, which was off.
*  What'd you have?
*  Yeah, I went high too, five and a half,
*  but it's four and a half.
*  Vegas zone.
*  Vegas zone.
*  Both teams have a bunch of injuries already.
*  The thing for me and why I kept looking at the Panthers is,
*  I'm not sure New Orleans is gonna have
*  a home field advantage this year
*  because of how unpopular a car is.
*  And just in general, the fans I think are pretty mad
*  about this team and what's happened with it.
*  And it does feel like Bryce comes out, does something,
*  they're up seven nothing, car throws a pick.
*  And I think the crowd turns immediately.
*  So it's almost like that first quarter
*  is gonna be where it goes.
*  Wow.
*  Panthers first quarter, let's bet it.
*  The Panthers money line I think is enticing.
*  And I think that line drops.
*  I think that goes, I wouldn't bet it,
*  but I would bet the money line, not the line.
*  Again, the league sent out a memo.
*  I know.
*  I'm just saying, if you're betting this game,
*  bet the money line.
*  Throw out the points.
*  Last one, Seahawks home for the Denver Broncos.
*  I kind of wish these two teams weren't playing each other
*  because I like both of them.
*  I had the Seahawks.
*  Old AFC West battle.
*  Yeah, I had Seahawks minus four.
*  You get this.
*  I said three and a half, it's five and a half.
*  Yeah, we moved Vegas only.
*  Let me count these up.
*  Seven.
*  I'm coming back a little bit.
*  This is where you make a mistake counting.
*  You can do your comeback next week.
*  It's 11-7.
*  One, two, three.
*  Oh, I'm not winning them.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, all right, good.
*  I told you, this is the only one I win.
*  All right.
*  I am gonna try hard not to put the Seahawks
*  in a teaser parlay.
*  Yeah.
*  I think this line feels a whiff too high,
*  but it is a rookie quarterback on the road in Seattle.
*  Aren't we gonna see a stat any day now
*  about rookie quarterbacks on the road
*  against the spread and all that stuff?
*  Not exactly a bevy of skill position guys,
*  but Tyler Lockett's banged up.
*  They're missing a pass rusher,
*  but otherwise Seattle looks pretty good.
*  Okay, two more, and these are both great ones.
*  Sunday night.
*  Detroit.
*  Home.
*  For the Rams.
*  Oh my God.
*  We talked to Jared Goff.
*  That guy is so happy.
*  He has no ill feelings against the Rams, Mike.
*  He's happy for everybody.
*  It worked out for him.
*  Did you know Matthew Stafford used to play for the Lions?
*  Did you even know that, Mike?
*  These guys played on each other's teams.
*  There's no animosity.
*  It's great, Mike.
*  Rams left tackles out.
*  They have a guard playing center.
*  Naku is still banged up.
*  Yeah.
*  Detroit's healthy.
*  Rams almost beat them around one last year.
*  To me, this is like, if you believe in the Lions,
*  you gotta fucking bet them this game.
*  Have to take them.
*  You have to bet them.
*  This is like, if you think they're a one seed
*  and all the shit they're gonna do,
*  like this is a game, take care of business,
*  take the lead, keep the foot in the pedal and go.
*  Monday night.
*  Well, the Lions, we didn't guess it,
*  but it scares me, those Lions.
*  We both said four and a half.
*  So I'm just setting up these games
*  and we're not actually getting the guess of the Lions.
*  We're doing a whole new thing this year.
*  I'm trying to get my mojo back.
*  Guess which Lions we're gonna guess
*  because we're not gonna guess all of them.
*  I'm just moving on.
*  You don't even get to guess the Lions.
*  I guess Lions minus four and a half over the Rams.
*  Yeah, so we both did and we both liked the Lions.
*  Why is it three and a half?
*  It's a little bit fishy.
*  Tiny bit fishy.
*  Little fishy.
*  Like what was the playoffs?
*  The playoff game, they could deal higher than that, wasn't it?
*  I think people are afraid of the Rams now.
*  They've just burned too many people.
*  They're like one of those boxers.
*  Nobody wants to fight anymore.
*  It's like give McVeigh like six guys
*  and somebody could throw the ball
*  and he could try to almost beat you.
*  Monday night, great game.
*  San Francisco 49ers home for the New York football Jets.
*  I picked 49ers by four and a half.
*  Yeah, I said four because there's so, so much Jets love here.
*  49ers are a little banged up too.
*  And it's three and a half.
*  I get that.
*  I get the weak.
*  Look at that.
*  That line was four and a half, eight, nine days ago
*  after I guessed the Lions and sent them to you.
*  Yeah, yeah, well, when I guessed them, it was,
*  but now it is what it is.
*  But, and I was like, do I need to put something in on this?
*  Cause I know that's gonna drop.
*  And now, I mean, Greenlaw's out, Caffrey's still hurt.
*  Hufanga might play, might not.
*  Warner's banged up.
*  Leonard Floyd's banged up.
*  Ricky Pearsall is obviously not playing.
*  Trent Williams is holding out.
*  We've no idea if we're gonna see him.
*  Iuke has had a fucked up off season
*  and I guess he's gonna play, but.
*  You get a free four plays out of Rogers.
*  Like no question about it.
*  He's definitely gonna get in there for four snaps.
*  Yeah, we know this will be the healthiest
*  the Jets will be all year.
*  Right, yeah.
*  I really like the spot for them.
*  And they, the Jets are, they just have a ton of talent.
*  I don't think they're gonna be afraid of this game.
*  And if you like the Jets and you don't like the Niners
*  and you gotta bet this game.
*  That's it.
*  Guess the lines, you're up.
*  You did it.
*  As always, you're up one nothing
*  in week one of the NFL season.
*  I know, I think I was like minus 650 to take the first week.
*  And then the over-under wins go away
*  and there's nothing I could do.
*  ["The Big Game"]
