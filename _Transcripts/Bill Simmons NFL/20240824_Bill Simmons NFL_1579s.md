# Five Favorite NFL Hot Takes with Steven Ruiz | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [August 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=0.0s)]
*  Steven Ruiz is here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=0.24s)]
*  He writes for the ringer.com a great website. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1.48s)]
*  He also is on the ringer NFL show. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=4.12s)]
*  He's known to have some takes and I wanted to bring them on to play five [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=6.4s)]
*  favorites with his five. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=9.88s)]
*  This is it, man. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  We're, we're bringing them right out of the pizza oven. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=13.32s)]
*  Your five hottest takes for 2024 in reverse order from five to one. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=16.76s)]
*  So what is number five? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=23.36s)]
*  Number five is Doug Peterson is the NFL's most overrated coach. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  And the Jaguars are going to finish last in the FC South because of it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=30.28s)]
*  That's number five. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=34.64s)]
*  I was told, like I, I, uh, I asked, that's amazing. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=36.56s)]
*  I can't wait for the next four. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=39.72s)]
*  If that was number five, he said that one's not hot enough. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=41.24s)]
*  Oh, that's good. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=45.0s)]
*  Well, I am also out on the Jags, but I do not have them under Tennessee. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=45.76s)]
*  So what, what make the case for them being worse than Tennessee? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=50.32s)]
*  Does that say, I have not heard that one yet. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=54.0s)]
*  I mean, when you hear reports out of their camp, first of all, they still [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  have offensive line issues and that was the crux of all of their issues last year. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=58.96s)]
*  They couldn't run the football. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=62.36s)]
*  They couldn't protect Trevor. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=63.24s)]
*  Their wide receiver game, but this off season did not pay off where they try to, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=64.64s)]
*  they thought they could get Calvin Ridley back. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=68.0s)]
*  They couldn't, they replaced them with Gabe Davis, who I don't think is a [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=69.6s)]
*  like for like replacement there. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=72.36s)]
*  And apparently he showed up to camp overweight. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=73.44s)]
*  That could be a concern there too. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=75.56s)]
*  And then first year defensive coordinator, you never know what to expect there. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=77.4s)]
*  But like my, my main reason is Doug Peterson in this. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  Attachment to press Taylor is offensive coordinator, which has gone [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=84.44s)]
*  back all the way to Philly. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=87.2s)]
*  And he lets them call plays and press Taylor just isn't the play caller. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=88.96s)]
*  He thinks he is. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  I think if Doug Peterson calls plays for this team, they could win eight, nine [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=93.08s)]
*  games, if press Taylor's calling the plays, I think it might be a five [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  win season for them, especially if everything goes wrong. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=99.6s)]
*  Let me, let me ask you a question. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=102.08s)]
*  Who do you think has more 10 win seasons? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=103.08s)]
*  Doug Peterson or Chip Kelly? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=105.24s)]
*  I mean, I gave away the answer there. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  How many does Doug Peterson have? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=109.16s)]
*  He has won the year they won the super bowl. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=110.96s)]
*  The year he had Jim Schwartz, the top five defensive coordinator in this [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=112.8s)]
*  league, the area Jeff Stoutland, the top five offensive line coach of all time. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=115.8s)]
*  Outside of that, he's only won nine games at most. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=119.28s)]
*  I was looking pretty heavily at their alt unders, cause you can get them under [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=122.08s)]
*  six and a half I'm with you on Jacksonville. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=125.8s)]
*  You can get them under six and a half. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=128.0s)]
*  It's like plus two 50. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=129.28s)]
*  The Brian Thomas junior stuff threw me off a tiny bit cause he's had an [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=130.84s)]
*  awesome training camp and it really does seem like he's going to be really good. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=134.72s)]
*  But I don't know how that helps their offensive line, but at least like they [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=139.04s)]
*  didn't keep Ridley, but it seems like they have somebody who's going to be able [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=142.6s)]
*  to play and make plays. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=145.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  And he's a rookie receiver. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  You never know with those guys, like they have to block. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=148.44s)]
*  They have to be able to line up in the right spot. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=150.36s)]
*  They have to be able to convert their routes based on the coverage. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  And in Jacksonville, that's been an issue for the last couple of years. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  So I don't have the most confidence in Doug Peterson being able to teach him and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=157.28s)]
*  get him ready for this season that quickly. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  I blame Brandon Staley. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=162.60000000000002s)]
*  Like this, this already conversation would have been a wrap if they hadn't [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=164.28s)]
*  blown that weed at halftime. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=167.16000000000003s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=168.4s)]
*  Where are you on Trevor Lawrence? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  Cause you've been known to be anti certain QBs, but then, you know, I think [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=171.32s)]
*  you're one of the Justin Herbert enablers. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=176.56s)]
*  There's a lot of them out there. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=178.56s)]
*  Uh, where are you on Trevor Lawrence? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=180.2s)]
*  I'm a, I'm a supporter. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=182.2s)]
*  I mean, there are weaknesses. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=183.56s)]
*  I'm not going to act like there aren't weaknesses. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=184.72s)]
*  I think he fumbles the ball too much. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=186.28s)]
*  I think he, he's a little too ambitious as a passer, a little too much dip on his [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=187.52s)]
*  chip, uh, inaccurate at times, but like, when you break down a skillset, there's [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=191.24s)]
*  nothing he lacks. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=196.6s)]
*  He has the arm strength. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=197.44s)]
*  He has the athleticism. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=199.24s)]
*  He has like the pocket movement. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=200.16s)]
*  He has the ability to read defenses, make quick decisions. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=201.52s)]
*  I think you put him in a decent system with an average supporting [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=204.64s)]
*  cast, average play calling. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=208.6s)]
*  I think we're viewing him as a consensus top 10 quarterback. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=210.72s)]
*  I think there are a lot of people that already view him as that. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=214.24s)]
*  This is the year where I want to see it because I don't think it's going to be [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=216.92s)]
*  good around him, but that's not an excuse anymore. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=220.24s)]
*  You're making $275 million. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=222.6s)]
*  Like you have to overcome your play. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=224.51999999999998s)]
*  You have to elevate the players around you. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=226.0s)]
*  It's going to be harder. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=228.04s)]
*  It's not going to look like, you know, reporting touchdowns, but give me the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=229.0s)]
*  year you gave me in 2022. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=234.76s)]
*  That's all I ask. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=236.08s)]
*  And that's not a high book. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=236.84s)]
*  I feel like we would have seen it in a real way at this point. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=239.0s)]
*  Here's another thing I don't like about Jacksonville week one at Miami week, two [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=241.48s)]
*  Cleveland week, three at Buffalo in Mexico, uh, week four at Houston, then [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=246.4s)]
*  Indy week five at Chicago week six. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=253.32s)]
*  That could be like one in five. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=255.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=258.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  And does this feel like a coaching staff that allows you to punch above your weight [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=259.16s)]
*  at all? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=262.64s)]
*  Like they lose the games they're supposed to lose and they lose some of the games [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=263.04s)]
*  they're supposed to win. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=265.72s)]
*  No, they're clearly, I have them clearly third. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=267.04s)]
*  Richardson would have to be like just bad for Indianapolis for them to be below [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=272.2s)]
*  Jacksonville and that might happen. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=276.72s)]
*  I mean, it can't be ruled out. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=278.48s)]
*  He might not, he might stink. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=279.64s)]
*  I'll, I'll wait for my first, my hottest take to break down why it's in Tennessee. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=281.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=287.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=288.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=289.44s)]
*  So go to number four. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  Number four take awesome kind of Eagles related to like, I mean, the Peterson [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=293.56s)]
*  thing is kind of Eagles related. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=297.68s)]
*  I think the Eagles offense is going to be a disaster. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=298.92s)]
*  And I think after this year, we're looking at a reset year for this team. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=301.16s)]
*  Similar to the Carson Wentz, uh, 30 million in dead money. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=304.52s)]
*  We don't care. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=308.8s)]
*  Just get rid of them here. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  I think they're headed down that same road right now. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=310.68s)]
*  I know the vibe seemed good out of camp. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=313.92s)]
*  Jalen just through his first interception camp the other day, but that Jason Kelsey [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=315.88s)]
*  loss is bigger than anyone is, is letting on about, like it might be the biggest loss [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=320.6s)]
*  of the off season. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=324.36s)]
*  This is maybe the best center in NFL history, but he was the best player in that [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=324.96s)]
*  Eagles offense for the last two years. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=329.32s)]
*  And the most important player. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=330.72s)]
*  He's the reason why they could do the stuff that they still did well last year. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=332.6s)]
*  Like the, the tush push was a lot about him, the run game, the quarterback run [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=336.08s)]
*  game, a lot about him. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  Like he was the one calling all the shots before the snap. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=342.92s)]
*  He was the one changing the place. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=345.16s)]
*  There's that famous clip from, I think it was the Kansas city game on Monday [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=346.24s)]
*  night where Jalen's trying to make a check at the line. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=349.76000000000005s)]
*  And then Kelsey kind of looks at him and just waves it off, like demonstrably. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=352.96000000000004s)]
*  He's like, no, no, that's, that's not your role in this offense. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=356.52000000000004s)]
*  And losing that I think is a bigger deal than we're giving credit to. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=359.56s)]
*  I mean, I talk about with, with Philly, I do wonder seven years now, are we [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=363.44000000000005s)]
*  going to look back at this era when a bunch of teams were like, we're going to [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=369.88s)]
*  pay our quarterback like 45 to 50 million a year, and we're also going to pay two [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=373.56s)]
*  receivers 20 to 30 million a year. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=378.0s)]
*  And this is a good game plan. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=381.56s)]
*  I wonder if like in 2031, we're going to look back and say, remember when teams [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=382.96s)]
*  were doing that and it turned out to be the most insane season murdering thing [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=387.4s)]
*  you could possibly do to spend over a hundred million dollars on two receivers [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=391.79999999999995s)]
*  and a quarterback, especially with this team, cause they've been through it [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=395.12s)]
*  before with Wentz where like even in 2017, it was very obvious the offensive [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=398.4s)]
*  line was kind of the key to everything they did offensively. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=401.8s)]
*  That was the case in 2022. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=404.32s)]
*  I feel like there is some naivety on, on Harry Roseman's part, paying [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=406.96000000000004s)]
*  Jaylen Hertz when they paid him, I thought was a mistake at the time. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=413.84000000000003s)]
*  And it looks like a mistake now. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=417.6s)]
*  This is the year where we find out. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  This is the make or break here, which is why I'm so confident that [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=420.68s)]
*  it's going to go either way. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=422.92s)]
*  Either they're going to win like 12 games and be back where they were in 2022. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=423.84000000000003s)]
*  Or I think it's going to be a disaster. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=427.72s)]
*  I like the Kellen Moore, Jaylen Hertz marriage. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=429.12s)]
*  I need to see if I get optimistic about it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=431.76s)]
*  Because isn't there a case though, but isn't there a case though that [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=434.35999999999996s)]
*  Hertz was just hurt last year? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=437.24s)]
*  That there is a case for that, but I don't think it had affected him in the ways. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=439.32s)]
*  That where he struggled the most, like as a passer in the pocket, I think [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=444.96s)]
*  it affected him as a runner. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=448.68s)]
*  I don't think he was as dynamic as a runner in the run game or on scramble plays. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=449.91999999999996s)]
*  I don't think he scrambled as much as he did before, but he has to have those [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=454.0s)]
*  parts of his game to be viable. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=458.44s)]
*  Cause we saw last year when he was just a pure drop back passer, it all fell apart. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=460.71999999999997s)]
*  And it wasn't like guys weren't open. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=465.56s)]
*  I know Brian Johnson wasn't the best offensive coordinator, especially in [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=467.24s)]
*  comparison to what was there before in Shane Steichen, but you watch the tape [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=470.0s)]
*  and guys were open and pockets were clean and Jaylen Hertz wasn't pulling the trigger. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=473.76s)]
*  And that falls on him. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=478.04s)]
*  Maybe there is some competence issue. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=479.32s)]
*  I believe it was the knee that was bothering him. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=480.88s)]
*  I just don't see how that would affect him in the pocket as a runner. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=483.28s)]
*  Yeah, I know we talked about it on both of our podcasts last year, but there [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=487.0s)]
*  was a couple of games, there was one game, they're playing somebody awful. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=490.40000000000003s)]
*  It was like the jets or the giants and he was just so bad the whole game. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=494.12s)]
*  And then it came down to the last two minutes and he just threw it into like [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=498.28000000000003s)]
*  triple coverage right to the other team. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=501.12s)]
*  It was like, it was like, does this guy have a concussion? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  What is happening? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=505.64s)]
*  He had a few of those games where you're really wondering like, what was wrong with him. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=506.8s)]
*  So I don't know, maybe, maybe he got down, maybe making a lot of money and having [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=511.16s)]
*  that contract, the pressure got to him, but he's certainly got to watch. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=515.44s)]
*  I think they bounced back, but I'm with you. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=519.5600000000001s)]
*  I certainly wouldn't bet on it. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=521.8800000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=523.44s)]
*  What do you got for three? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=523.6800000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=526.1600000000001s)]
*  How hot do I want to go here? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=526.5200000000001s)]
*  I'm going to go hot. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=527.8000000000001s)]
*  It's like, pull this right out of the 850 degree oven. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=528.6800000000001s)]
*  The jets are a top five team in the NFL this year. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=532.5200000000001s)]
*  Is that hot for you? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=535.72s)]
*  It's hot. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=538.48s)]
*  It's, it's, I think they're the single hardest team to figure out in the league. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=539.4000000000001s)]
*  I think they're hard to figure out because so much of it has to do with the fact that [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=543.6400000000001s)]
*  they play on that turf and they have a bunch of guys who should not be playing on that [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=547.08s)]
*  turf. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=551.1600000000001s)]
*  Like this should be an HR complaint on their, on their part. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=551.32s)]
*  There might be like a mass ritual ACL tearing in week one if these, if all these guys play, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=553.96s)]
*  but if they stay healthy and that's a big if I look at the construction of this roster, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=559.8000000000001s)]
*  I look at what the team has been despite its quarterback play in the last couple of years. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=563.9200000000001s)]
*  Like you have a number three defense with what I would consider as a number one [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=567.84s)]
*  defense. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=573.04s)]
*  I would consider what's the opposite of a complimentary offense because that's what [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=573.56s)]
*  they had. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=577.76s)]
*  They, especially with Robert, an insulting offense, an insulting offense, especially [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=578.3199999999999s)]
*  with how Robert solid likes to play defense where it's like, we're just going to rush [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=583.3199999999999s)]
*  forward. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=586.7199999999999s)]
*  We're going to play zone coverage. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=587.0799999999999s)]
*  That becomes harder to do when you're playing from behind because teams can just run the [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=588.7199999999999s)]
*  football. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=592.88s)]
*  They don't have to drop back and pass the ball. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=593.4s)]
*  You don't get those jumps on the snap. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=595.16s)]
*  So the fact that they've remained in the top five bodes well for them going forward. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=597.76s)]
*  And maybe they were seven and 10 last year. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=601.36s)]
*  Seven and 10 with how are they seven and 10? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=605.36s)]
*  They had the worst offense I've ever seen in my life. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=607.4s)]
*  I think they won seven games the year before that. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=610.04s)]
*  And Chris Streveler, who is for my money, the worst quarterback I've ever seen attempt [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=611.64s)]
*  to pass in NFL history, played, played meaningful snaps with them and they won seven [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=615.52s)]
*  games. So I think Bob solid like is a better coach than he gets credit for. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=619.96s)]
*  And then maybe I'm just like bombing onto the preseason results from last year. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=624.16s)]
*  But we saw Aaron Rodgers play last year. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=627.8000000000001s)]
*  Like, it's not like we haven't seen him play since Green Bay. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=629.9200000000001s)]
*  And when he played in August and he got to play with Garrett Wilson, it looked like the [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=633.0400000000001s)]
*  Devontae Adams, Aaron Rodgers combination that we saw in 2021 and 2020 when he won MVP. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=636.9200000000001s)]
*  And a big part of Rodgers problems in that last year in Green Bay, he was hurt like he [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=642.84s)]
*  couldn't run. And that's what stuck out when we watched him on film is like, if a play [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=647.76s)]
*  was dead, it was dead. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=652.1600000000001s)]
*  And in the past, Rodgers could get outside the pocket, make an off-platform throw. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=653.1600000000001s)]
*  He didn't have that in Green Bay's last year. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=657.08s)]
*  If that comes back again, another big if because now he has an Achilles injury on top [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=659.1999999999999s)]
*  of that, they have a decent offensive line. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=663.5999999999999s)]
*  They have Garrett Wilson, who I think is the top 10 receiver. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=666.56s)]
*  I would say better than decent for the offensive line, wouldn't you? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=669.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean, if they if they stay healthy, I think that's an above average offensive line, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=672.4399999999999s)]
*  especially with the investments they made this offseason. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=676.5999999999999s)]
*  Like they signed a couple of guys from free agency. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=679.16s)]
*  They have some guys coming back from injury. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=681.7199999999999s)]
*  They have the weapons for them. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=685.0799999999999s)]
*  They have some handpicked weapons that Aaron Rodgers picked himself. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=686.6s)]
*  I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=689.04s)]
*  I'm not concerned about Nate Hackett being heavily involved because I think Aaron Rodgers [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=691.36s)]
*  has the ability to turn off his headset and call his own play. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=695.44s)]
*  And I think that's what he was doing when Hackett was his OC in Green Bay. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=698.2s)]
*  And I think that's why he wanted him in New York. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=701.0s)]
*  So if Aaron Rodgers, if this is in his hands, those are capable hands, in my opinion. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=703.12s)]
*  They have a ton of talent on both sides of the ball. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=709.5600000000001s)]
*  They might have the best running back in the entire league, or at least in the top [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=712.44s)]
*  three, the way he looked down the stretch last year. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=716.12s)]
*  If McCaffrey's hurt all season, he might be the number one weapon. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=720.28s)]
*  He's probably going to be the most expensive fantasy guy. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=723.16s)]
*  Wilson could be like one of the seven best receivers in the league. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=726.16s)]
*  We have no idea because he had nobody. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=729.52s)]
*  We didn't even know who was throwing the ball. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=731.04s)]
*  I was looking at some of the high end bets with them. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=733.08s)]
*  Cause I'm with you, the ceiling of them, if Saul is just doing defense, that's it. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=736.12s)]
*  And Rodgers is basically the head coach on offense and he's healthy. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=741.32s)]
*  Like there's a lot of if, if, if, if, but the ifs are pretty high end. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=745.08s)]
*  Like that number one seed, which was nine to one on Fandl like two months ago. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=749.32s)]
*  Now it's plus seven 50. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=753.8000000000001s)]
*  There's been some action on it. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=755.08s)]
*  Their division odds were like plus one 80 plus one 75. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=756.76s)]
*  Now they're the favorite in the division at plus one 55. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=760.2s)]
*  I think people are all looking at it the same way. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=763.48s)]
*  And I've heard the Hassan Reddick. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=765.1600000000001s)]
*  Well, they don't have Reddick. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=768.12s)]
*  Why'd they do that? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=769.08s)]
*  Well, they traded next year's number two for him. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=769.76s)]
*  It's not, they didn't trade anyone to have on this year's team, you know, he's [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=772.92s)]
*  going to obviously come back at some point. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=776.28s)]
*  That's going to be a bonus, but I can't shake the Rodgers hasn't been good in [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=777.88s)]
*  three years piece. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=782.76s)]
*  I can't shake the Jets turf, the Jets history, the jet stuff in general, but [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=783.8s)]
*  they seem like they're the safest bet in the AFC East. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=789.8s)]
*  I certainly like that more than Buffalo or Miami. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=792.92s)]
*  And maybe I'm, I'm reading too much into this and this doesn't matter at all, but I [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=796.04s)]
*  like the uniform change. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=799.96s)]
*  I like going back to the classic uniforms. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=801.32s)]
*  Always a move that works. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=803.24s)]
*  The Bucks did it when they got Brady, they went to Superbowl, the Browns did when [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=804.28s)]
*  they had Baker, they went to playoff game. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=807.48s)]
*  Like going back to the classic Jersey always, always offers a boost to the team. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=809.16s)]
*  There's a case here with them. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=812.76s)]
*  They're at San Francisco on a Monday night, week one, but they're catching San [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=815.0s)]
*  Francisco, I think, at a nice spot with the McCaffrey piece, IU, who the hell knows, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=819.32s)]
*  Trent Williams, who the hell knows. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=824.36s)]
*  Like that, I would want to play San Francisco in week one if I had to play them at San [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=825.8s)]
*  Francisco, then they're at Tennessee. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=829.64s)]
*  They're home for the Pats on a Thursday, home for Denver. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=831.9599999999999s)]
*  They played Minnesota in London and Minnesota is probably not going to be great. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=835.7199999999999s)]
*  They might be like four and one after those first five, maybe even five and oh, and at [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=840.12s)]
*  some point there's going to be Jets momentum going. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=844.12s)]
*  I like their schedule. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=846.5999999999999s)]
*  They have some, some, some stinkers in there. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=847.56s)]
*  Yeah, I haven't decided fully yet and I don't feel great about it, but I feel my brain [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=851.4799999999999s)]
*  gravitated to them. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=857.4799999999999s)]
*  What do you got for number two? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=858.5999999999999s)]
*  This isn't really a take. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=860.52s)]
*  It's a prediction, but I think it's pretty hot just based on their past results. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=861.4799999999999s)]
*  I think Matthew Stafford is winning MVP and I think Sean McVay, we're going to see [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=865.56s)]
*  Sean McVay's best offense ever. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=869.0799999999999s)]
*  Matthew Stafford is winning MVP is a hot take. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=871.56s)]
*  He almost wanted two years ago or whenever they won the Super Bowl. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=875.56s)]
*  He almost wanted, he was like one of the favorite players. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=878.52s)]
*  One of the favorites, but I'll say this when you said Matthew Stafford, I thought you were, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=880.52s)]
*  I actually thought you were going to say something like, I think his career is over [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=885.0799999999999s)]
*  and I think he's going to start 12 more games. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=888.4399999999999s)]
*  And you went, you zagged and did MVP. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=890.52s)]
*  I mean, if you would ask me a month, a year and a half ago, I would have said that I was [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=892.84s)]
*  one of the people that left him for dead after the season when he hurts his back. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=896.6s)]
*  You like watch him play after that and he's not, he doesn't have the same zip on his [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=900.04s)]
*  passes. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=904.76s)]
*  I don't think he's as confident in the pocket, but last year that was top five [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=905.16s)]
*  quarterback play. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=910.12s)]
*  He didn't have the best offensive line. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=911.88s)]
*  He didn't have the best run game. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=913.4s)]
*  That offense was very much, Hey, Matthew Stafford, we're going to put a lot on your [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=915.16s)]
*  plate and go do it. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=918.6s)]
*  It's like reminiscent of an ISO offense, like Allen Iverson back in the early 2000s. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=919.5600000000001s)]
*  Like that's what it felt like to me. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=925.08s)]
*  I mean, obviously he has more talent around him. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=927.0s)]
*  You can't do it all on your own in the NFL. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=928.84s)]
*  He has Spook and Nakua. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=930.44s)]
*  He has Sean McVay dialing up the plays, but now he's got rejuvenated Cooper Cup. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=931.8s)]
*  Rejuvenate. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=936.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's a, that's a big reason why I'm buying this team because Cooper [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=937.56s)]
*  Cup wasn't good last year. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=940.68s)]
*  They beat Detroit in that playoff game. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=942.28s)]
*  If Cooper Cup hangs onto a pass on fourth down. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=944.1199999999999s)]
*  No, it looked like his career was headed to being over, but he was obviously really [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=946.68s)]
*  hurt and now he seems like he's on a mission. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=951.0799999999999s)]
*  But reports out of camp seem to suggest that Cooper Cup is back and he's back to [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=953.64s)]
*  what he was two years ago. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=957.64s)]
*  That's the case. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=958.68s)]
*  And they pair him with Nakua and they had those two guys creating the system they [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=959.2399999999999s)]
*  had when they had Odell late in that year, that Superbowl run. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=963.16s)]
*  Those guys were hard to cover. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=966.52s)]
*  And I think they're running backs too, by the way, because they got Williams and then [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=967.72s)]
*  they'd like the guy they drafted and they might have a little two headed monster [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=971.1600000000001s)]
*  thing going too. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=974.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=975.72s)]
*  And their offensive line has, has been upgraded and apparently Sean McVay has [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=975.96s)]
*  really invested in diversifying his run game. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=979.88s)]
*  Like when they played the Patriots in the Superbowl, it was easy for Belichick to [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=982.12s)]
*  devise the game plan because they did two things. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=985.48s)]
*  And if you stop those two things, they were done because Jared Goff couldn't [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=987.48s)]
*  create it out of structure. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=990.44s)]
*  That's not the case anymore. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=992.44s)]
*  Sean McVay is going to have answers. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=993.88s)]
*  He's going to have counters to your answers. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=995.16s)]
*  And then he has a quarterback that you could put back there in shotgun. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=997.48s)]
*  You can empty out the backfield and just let them kind of read things out. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1001.96s)]
*  He has so many options. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1005.32s)]
*  I think this is the best Rams offense we've seen since he got there. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1006.52s)]
*  And that's certainly was in the last half of the season. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1010.2s)]
*  It felt like they were in the top four and that was with Cup not even being [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1013.64s)]
*  really cut. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1018.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1018.84s)]
*  I, yeah, I have a hot take off your hot take. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1019.56s)]
*  I, first of all, Stafford 30 to one on Fandl to win MVP. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1022.12s)]
*  So that's, that's tasty. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1025.24s)]
*  NFC West to me is the alpha division this year. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1027.8799999999999s)]
*  I really like it. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1031.72s)]
*  You could talk me into four playoff teams with them if I had like two drinks, but [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1032.92s)]
*  I think they could easily. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1037.24s)]
*  I, I said this to Sheila earlier. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1038.52s)]
*  I like the, I like the NFC a little more than I think most people. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1040.52s)]
*  And I really liked the NFC West lions Packers. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1044.68s)]
*  The Falcons are interesting. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1048.6s)]
*  Eagles, maybe Cowboys, but you know, I think it's, it's going to be a little [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1049.96s)]
*  tougher to get one of those playoff spots than people think. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1054.52s)]
*  But if, if the Rams, the Donald thing is the scary part. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1056.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1061.88s)]
*  I have no way to quantify what it's like to lose the best player who ever played [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1062.2s)]
*  that position and he just leaves. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1065.8s)]
*  Like, how do you replace that? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1067.32s)]
*  I know they have some younger guys they like, but it's, that could be one of those [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1068.6000000000001s)]
*  things four weeks in where we're like, Oh man, remember when we thought the Rams [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1072.1200000000001s)]
*  defense was going to survive losing our, our Donald. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1075.0s)]
*  Now he's such like a load bearing player too, for them. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1077.72s)]
*  And for that defense in the past, like everything was built around the fact [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1080.52s)]
*  that he could get pressure in 1.5 seconds and right in the quarterback's lap. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1083.64s)]
*  And losing that just has to alter things. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1086.68s)]
*  That's why I kept the defense out of this piece. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1088.76s)]
*  And I just focused on the offense for this because I'm with you. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1091.08s)]
*  I don't know how to calibrate this. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1093.4s)]
*  So I, if I gave you both LA teams in the playoffs, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1095.56s)]
*  and I said pick yes, no, are you no on that? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1101.4s)]
*  I'm not totally no, I'm no, because the AFC is tough for the charters to overcome, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1105.32s)]
*  but I think the charters are going to surprise a lot of people because I have [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1109.6399999999999s)]
*  confidence in that coaching staff. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1112.36s)]
*  They win everywhere they go. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1113.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1115.1599999999999s)]
*  Either chargers are plus one 14. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1116.52s)]
*  And then the rant, this is just to make the playoffs, the man Rams are minus one [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1120.52s)]
*  Oh six. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1124.28s)]
*  That's probably like plus two 50. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1124.76s)]
*  So it's a little more realistic, but I guess from a game like this, I think [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1126.52s)]
*  it's a little more realistic. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1129.32s)]
*  I think it's a little more realistic. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1130.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1132.2s)]
*  It's time. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1132.76s)]
*  I don't know how you get hotter than Matthew Stafford winning the MVP at 30 to [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1133.4s)]
*  one, but it is time for the number one hottest take from Steven Ruiz. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1136.68s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1140.6000000000001s)]
*  What is it? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1141.0800000000002s)]
*  Bryce Young gets benched this year. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1141.64s)]
*  And at the end of the season, we all agree that he's QB four in this class. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1144.0400000000002s)]
*  Maybe QB five are in his class. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1147.5600000000002s)]
*  Bryce Young gets benched like halfway through this. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1151.48s)]
*  Like it's that bad where they're just like, we have to get to the top. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1155.24s)]
*  We have to get to the top. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1158.2s)]
*  It's that bad where they're just like, we have to like get this guy off the field [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1159.56s)]
*  and reset and try to figure out what happened here. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1163.96s)]
*  It's the Zach Wilson thing where you frame it as like we need him to take a step back [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1166.1999999999998s)]
*  and be able to like see things from the outside in. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1170.04s)]
*  We got Andy Dalton here. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1171.96s)]
*  He's a capable veteran who can kind of show him the ropes secretly. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1173.1599999999999s)]
*  Andy Dalton was the only quarterback who really performed well when he got to play last year. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1176.6799999999998s)]
*  We had the same supporting cast as Bryce Young, but it looked a lot better. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1180.9199999999998s)]
*  But I'm writing the quarterback rankings right now. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1185.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm doing the blurbs and I saved the young quarterbacks for last because I want to compare [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1187.56s)]
*  how they finished last year to what they're doing in preseason. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1190.84s)]
*  And I watched him and Will Levis back to back. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1193.32s)]
*  And I would not blink if you gave me a choice between those two quarterbacks. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1195.96s)]
*  I would take Will Levis every time. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1198.9199999999998s)]
*  I think Will Levis actually showed the traits of a top quarterback. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1200.52s)]
*  With Bryce Young, I didn't see him. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1204.2s)]
*  What is the trait? [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1207.24s)]
*  What is the thing you've gone on to? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1208.04s)]
*  With a lot of these quarterbacks, there's something you could take from their rookie year. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1210.28s)]
*  With Josh Allen, he had that bad rookie year, but everyone was like, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1214.52s)]
*  look at his intermediate numbers from 10 to 19 yards. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1217.48s)]
*  He's one of the best quarterbacks. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1219.56s)]
*  Zach Wilson, it was like over 2.5 seconds. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1221.24s)]
*  If he gets protection, he's one of the higher rated quarterbacks. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1224.2s)]
*  Even Blaine Gabbard got some of this. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1226.52s)]
*  With Bryce Young, there's no split you could do to make his numbers look good. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1228.44s)]
*  It seems like the only case is Dave Canales. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1233.16s)]
*  He worked magic with Baker Mayfield and now it's going to be Bryce Young. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1237.24s)]
*  That's the only case I've heard for it. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1240.68s)]
*  Other than, oh, it was a bad year. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1242.6s)]
*  He's learned some stuff and year two. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1244.04s)]
*  He didn't bring Mike Evans along with him. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1246.76s)]
*  He didn't bring that guy along with him. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1248.52s)]
*  So I don't know how it works out. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1249.8s)]
*  And there has to be a trait you build around. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1252.28s)]
*  The comparison before the draft was Steph Curry. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1254.84s)]
*  He's the Steph Curry of football. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1257.1599999999999s)]
*  What's the equivalent of Steph Curry's three-point shooting in Bryce Young's game? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1259.0s)]
*  I think the thing that was shocking to me was that he wasn't as lightning fast, scrambling. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1263.48s)]
*  And I thought he'd be one of those guys, because in college he was in such control when he moved around. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1269.72s)]
*  And he always felt like he was a half step faster than anyone chasing him. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1276.36s)]
*  And then the pros, he just wasn't. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1279.16s)]
*  So there was that. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1280.84s)]
*  And then you get to the pros. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1282.12s)]
*  I think we just forget this. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1283.4s)]
*  Just how fucking big the linemen are on both sides. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1285.08s)]
*  You know? [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1287.8s)]
*  He couldn't throw the ball over the middle because, you know, that's a guy six-five here, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1289.08s)]
*  six-six here, six-seven here. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1293.24s)]
*  So they were trying to innovate and have him roll out a little bit or take a seven-step drop. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1295.4s)]
*  And it was pretty ugly. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1300.6s)]
*  I was looking at, I think they're going to be terrible. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1302.36s)]
*  I was looking at some of their alt-unders, like their alt-under three and a half wins. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1305.0s)]
*  So then go three and 14 or worse is plus 330. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1310.6s)]
*  To go four and 13 or worse is plus 205. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1316.52s)]
*  I think the three worst teams in the league are going to be the Panthers, the Patriots, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1319.96s)]
*  the Giants, and I would have Vegas. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1325.0s)]
*  Probably the four. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1328.12s)]
*  Those four, I just don't see any path for any of those teams being good. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1329.4s)]
*  Vegas is like the quarterback thing and the coach. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1333.16s)]
*  That's just a mass murder, right? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1335.56s)]
*  Giants, the Dimes thing combined with the weird offseason they had. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1338.2s)]
*  That's a murder. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1343.0s)]
*  And then if you're right about Bryce, what's the path for the Panthers? [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1344.6s)]
*  They didn't even have a first run pick. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1347.32s)]
*  I think even if I'm wrong about Bryce, what's the path for them? [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1349.16s)]
*  Even if Bryce is the 20th best quarterback in the NFL, the supporting cast is one of [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1353.0800000000002s)]
*  the worst in the NFL. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1357.0s)]
*  The defense isn't going to be that good. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1358.1200000000001s)]
*  I would put them in their own category almost, with the Raiders. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1361.24s)]
*  I would put the Raiders in there, but at least the Raiders have a defense that looked good [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1364.76s)]
*  last year at the end of last year. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1368.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1369.4s)]
*  The Raiders can rush the passer, but that's not going to matter if they're down 14 in [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1369.64s)]
*  the third quarter. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1373.5600000000002s)]
*  The big pass rush ain't helping. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1375.16s)]
*  The bigger piece of this would be if he really did suck and got benched this year, now that [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1377.1599999999999s)]
*  trade's moving into a whole different category of Caleb's good, right? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1385.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1389.6399999999999s)]
*  And that's the problem. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1389.8799999999999s)]
*  We're already seeing some comparisons. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1391.32s)]
*  Caleb made that one throw where he spun out and threw to his left. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1393.6399999999999s)]
*  I saw Panthers Twitter. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1396.52s)]
*  I'm a Panthers fan, so I'm following all those people. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1397.56s)]
*  They were posting the clips of Bryce Young doing a similar play last year, but it wasn't [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1399.6399999999999s)]
*  quite the same. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1403.48s)]
*  But you hit the nail on the head. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1404.9199999999998s)]
*  The pass rushers in this league are big and they're strong and they're fast. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1407.56s)]
*  And Bryce Young is none of those things. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1411.08s)]
*  And you could see him try to work around those defensive linemen. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1412.9199999999998s)]
*  It's just not there. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1416.6799999999998s)]
*  He doesn't have the arm talent to do it. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1417.6399999999999s)]
*  He can't make the throws to the perimeter. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1419.08s)]
*  And like you said, the middle of the field is kind of cut off to him. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1420.84s)]
*  There's nowhere else on the field to throw the football. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1423.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1425.3999999999999s)]
*  You're just throwing deep outs and stops or screen passes or whatever, bubble screens. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1425.56s)]
*  We should have mentioned earlier, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1432.04s)]
*  you're a giant Panthers fan. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1433.4s)]
*  So this is something you've probably put more thought into than any other team and any other [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1435.0800000000002s)]
*  take. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1440.3600000000001s)]
*  And you watch Bryce every week. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1440.68s)]
*  And I thought the same thing. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1442.44s)]
*  That was why that one time when he beat the Packers, it made me so mad. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1444.68s)]
*  I had the Packers and a tease. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1448.44s)]
*  I'm like, you gotta be fucking kidding me. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1449.72s)]
*  This guy can't do anything every week. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1451.4s)]
*  And now he's torching you. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1453.48s)]
*  But that was the perfect game for him. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1454.76s)]
*  Now, as you face a soft defensive line who does, he's not going to put pressure on the [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1456.76s)]
*  pocket. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1460.52s)]
*  He's going to play off in the secondary. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1460.92s)]
*  That's how he has to play. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1463.5600000000002s)]
*  That's the type of defense he has to play. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1465.0800000000002s)]
*  You're not going to see those in the NFL very often, though. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1467.0s)]
*  So they start at New Orleans, home chargers, at Vegas, home since he at Chicago. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1469.64s)]
*  That Chicago game could be a nightmare. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1475.88s)]
*  That's week five. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1478.44s)]
*  If Caleb's awesome and Bryce has like three picks, that's a disaster. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1479.4s)]
*  They somehow pulled out the Texans game last year because that had the potential to be [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1484.8400000000001s)]
*  the disaster because of how Shroud looked. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1488.2s)]
*  But if it happens this time, especially since they made the like for like trade. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1490.04s)]
*  And with Dave Tepper, it's hard to describe what it's like to be a fan of a team with [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1495.72s)]
*  a bad owner, especially in the NFL, because it's so easy to hide in plain sight in the [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1502.12s)]
*  NFL. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1505.56s)]
*  You have to be Dan Snyder to get the bad owner rep. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1505.8799999999999s)]
*  Where like in the NBA, if you don't pay the luxury tax, you're a bad owner. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1508.84s)]
*  In the MLB, it's very easy because there's no salary cap. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1512.76s)]
*  I mean, he's a bad owner. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1516.04s)]
*  He's showed it. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1517.8799999999999s)]
*  The hires have been bad. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1519.24s)]
*  The patience, there has been no patience as evidenced by the trade for Bryce Young. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1520.68s)]
*  He couldn't wait one year for Caleb. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1525.24s)]
*  He needed his number one overall pick that year. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1526.76s)]
*  And he picked a year where the number one prospect was 5'8 and weighs 180 pounds. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1529.16s)]
*  Well, anytime you fire a coach you hired during the first season of that coach, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1533.56s)]
*  it's a pretty rare level to get to as an owner. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1538.68s)]
*  Like to miss that that badly where you're like, I can't even wait till the end of the [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1541.48s)]
*  year to get rid of this guy. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1544.92s)]
*  He went the whole off season to hire him and that's how bad it went. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1546.6000000000001s)]
*  He did it with the MLS team too. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1549.8s)]
*  The MLS, he owns both teams in Charlotte and he fired the MLS manager too within a year. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1551.64s)]
*  David Tepper. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1558.04s)]
*  Some people shouldn't own a sports team. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1558.8400000000001s)]
*  Stephen Ruiz. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1560.76s)]
*  We can read you on theringer.com. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1561.56s)]
*  We can listen on the Ringer NFL show. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1562.92s)]
*  Great takes. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1564.68s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1565.16s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAnE2MGZ_g&t=1566.28s)]
