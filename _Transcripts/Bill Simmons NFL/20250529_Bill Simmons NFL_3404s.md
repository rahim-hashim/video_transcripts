# The Rodgers-Steelers Saga, Playoff Tweaks and More NFL Offseason Subplots | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=0.0s)]
*  We're recording this part of the podcast. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=0.5s)]
*  That is late Thursday morning, Pacific time. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2.08s)]
*  I needed a Massachusetts guy on it. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=4.12s)]
*  It'd been a while. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=6.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=7.0200000000000005s)]
*  I've had, had a few over the years, but we got Albert Brewer from sports [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  illustrator also haven't talked football in a long time on this podcast. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=10.8s)]
*  Haven't talked football with you on this podcast ever. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=15.14s)]
*  And I sent you a text and I said, come up with a gimmick. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  I don't want to know what it is. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=22.16s)]
*  Maybe it's a gimmick. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=23.92s)]
*  Like you're buried in the NBA playoffs. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=25.28s)]
*  Stuff's happening in the NFL that you're probably not paying attention to. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=28.74s)]
*  I'm here to tell you what that is. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=32.08s)]
*  What gimmick did you come up with? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=33.34s)]
*  That was actually exactly it, Bill. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=35.2s)]
*  Um, I suppose your gimmick that, uh, that, that, yeah, you might be [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=36.74s)]
*  buried in the NBA playoffs. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=42.42s)]
*  And so we're going to get everybody caught up on what's happening in the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=43.82s)]
*  NFL who hasn't been paying attention. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  And, um, I got a sneaking suspicion. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=48.7s)]
*  A couple of these, you probably, uh, you probably paid some attention to, but, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=51.1s)]
*  um, I actually had trouble narrowing it down to five, but I think I have five [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=55.32s)]
*  weeks to work with. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=59.64s)]
*  You could do an honorable mention at the end. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=60.72s)]
*  If there's a couple honorable mentions, like my honorable mention, we can do [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=62.52s)]
*  that start like Jim mercy is passing. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=66.28s)]
*  I think, you know, we should give some, uh, give some mention to that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=69.0s)]
*  And then Trey Hendrickson's contract situation. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  I didn't know if that was interesting enough, but that's still ongoing. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=75.84s)]
*  Um, we'll save those for the end. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  Come, come in with a bang first, and then we'll save the honorable [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=81.44s)]
*  mention for late. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=84.16s)]
*  The other thing is like over the last 48 hours, I did learn what pink cocaine is. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=85.2s)]
*  So I got that too. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=89.2s)]
*  So this has been on a few of my past fan text threads. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=92.64s)]
*  I also did not know what pink cocaine is, but I'm old. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=97.44s)]
*  Um, yeah, Stefan Diggs already in a, what is it a yacht scandal? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=100.84s)]
*  Is it an embrolio? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=105.88s)]
*  What is it? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if it would, I mean, it's not like it's up there with like [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=108.12s)]
*  the love boat, you know, um, in Minnesota 20 years ago, that, that I think still a [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=111.36s)]
*  gold standard that probably put, I probably still put this behind like the SS Beckham [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=115.52s)]
*  and, um, 2016, right, right before the playoffs, but maybe it might be number [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=120.64s)]
*  three in my time covered in the NFL as far as boat scandals go. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=126.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=130.16s)]
*  Vrabel Pat's coach, Mike Vrabel, uh, the new most important coach of my life. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=130.36s)]
*  Uh, did he was just basically like, we're not talking about this and yada [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=135.96s)]
*  did a little bit and we'll see if the story does. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=140.08s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=142.6s)]
*  So let's go top five biggest things do first and then we'll do honorable mentions. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=143.12s)]
*  So the biggest thing that has happened during the NBA playoffs, NFL related [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=147.4s)]
*  that you think I should care about because I'm paying attention is what. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=151.8s)]
*  There's a Steelers didn't sign a quarterback. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=155.44s)]
*  What are they doing? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=160.04s)]
*  Um, they are pretty confident that their quarterback is going to be Aaron Rogers. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=161.68s)]
*  And I do think that there's like, I think there's actually some decent reason here [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=167.2s)]
*  for people who want to listen to it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=172.2s)]
*  And I think this, this, this goes back to like how you manage everything in the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=173.88s)]
*  spring and trying to get their work done. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=180.16s)]
*  And I think the logic for both sides here was if he signs April 1st and look, he's [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=182.2s)]
*  got personal stuff he's dealing with, he's traveling and if he signs April 1st [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=187.83999999999997s)]
*  and says, okay, guys, like, I'm going to go away for the next two months. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=192.76s)]
*  And when I'm back, I'm back, but like, I got, I got some personal stuff. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=196.32000000000002s)]
*  I got to attend to, I got to, I'm, I've got travel plan. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  Um, what you're inviting then is then whenever you, you, you start the off [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=205.24s)]
*  season program, you get no TAs, um, anytime the media is there, it's going to be, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=209.84s)]
*  where's Aaron, where's Aaron, where's Aaron. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=215.0s)]
*  And so I think both sides wanted to avoid that. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=217.24s)]
*  Um, and so that's part of it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=220.76000000000002s)]
*  And then I think the other end of it, and this is like to me, almost the more [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=222.44s)]
*  interesting thing, I think Aaron was really affected by the way his, um, his [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=225.56s)]
*  trip to Egypt was covered last year. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=230.36s)]
*  And so going through all of that, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=232.76s)]
*  we can, we can we go backwards. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=234.88s)]
*  How was it covered? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=236.4s)]
*  I don't even remember. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=237.16s)]
*  Well, if you remember, so he skipped the mini kid, the jets had their mini camp [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=238.12s)]
*  at the end of June or in the middle of June last year at the end of their off [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=241.12s)]
*  season program and Aaron had been like pretty much a full participant in [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=244.0s)]
*  everything that they'd done up until then. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  And then he skipped the mini camp. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=251.44s)]
*  And it was something that they had kind of predetermined he was going to do, but [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=253.76000000000002s)]
*  you know, Salah said to him, okay, like that's fine, but I still have to find you [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=257.92s)]
*  and I still have to hold you responsible. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=261.6s)]
*  I still have to say, like, this isn't an excused absence because we have to have [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=263.16s)]
*  a standard for everybody. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=267.16s)]
*  And it became like a two or three week story. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=269.24s)]
*  And when they hit bumps in the summer and early in the fall, it [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=271.88s)]
*  continued to be a story. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=275.76s)]
*  And I, like the sense I get is that Aaron was frustrated by that and he didn't [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=277.04s)]
*  want to go through that again. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=281.44s)]
*  So I think part of the logic here for the Steelers for Aaron is just whenever [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=282.44s)]
*  you're in, you're all in, but not until then. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=289.0s)]
*  And so I think the logic here between the Steelers and Aaron is like, okay, like [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=292.08s)]
*  once you show up, like we need all of you, bud, we need you, we need you all the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=297.4s)]
*  way here. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=302.08s)]
*  And so Aaron's taken care of everything he needs to take care of now. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=303.48s)]
*  And, and, and when he shows up, I do think he'll be all in. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=307.08s)]
*  And, you know, again, I think a huge part of this is marked by what happened with [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=310.44s)]
*  the jets last year. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=314.08s)]
*  Can I recap your seemingly logical explanation? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=315.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=319.44s)]
*  So Aaron Rogers was upset that when he left the team to go to Egypt during a time [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=320.88s)]
*  when all of his teammates were actually around and accountable to play for the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=327.36s)]
*  jets, that people covered that like it was a news story because he was the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=330.8s)]
*  quarterback of the most famous person in the team. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=335.12s)]
*  And he didn't like how that played out. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=337.32s)]
*  Because it was his new story. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=338.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=340.84s)]
*  So he didn't like that. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=341.56s)]
*  A new story was a news story. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=342.36s)]
*  And now he is doing this. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=344.48s)]
*  Uh, I don't know what I'm doing yet, but then he's also showing up on Pat McAfee, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=346.68s)]
*  just a pining on stuff and kind of doing it every once. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=351.68s)]
*  Like if I'm on the Steelers and I thought this guy, I, I thought Rogers was, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=354.56s)]
*  didn't want to get hit anymore last year. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=359.71999999999997s)]
*  I don't know how you felt. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=361.52s)]
*  Did you feel like he wanted to get hit anymore? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  Cause I didn't know. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=364.24s)]
*  I think that there's an element of that, but I think if you go back and you watch, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=365.0s)]
*  you see pieces of it, like I'm telling you, just pull up like a 10 minute [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=367.92s)]
*  highlight of their game against the Jaguars, which nobody watched. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=372.04s)]
*  Cause it was the jets and the Jaguars at the end of the season. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=374.72s)]
*  But if you pull up like a 10 minute YouTube highlight of that game at the end [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=377.36s)]
*  of December, you'll see it's like all still there. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=381.04s)]
*  You'll be like, wow, like that looks like Aaron Rogers in 2011, you know? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=383.76s)]
*  I mean, I didn't realize he was able to pull that off against the tanking Jaguars. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=387.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, but it does look good. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=392.36s)]
*  I'm just telling you that like, like I understand, but like there were [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=394.32s)]
*  some real, there was like some high level shit in that game and that he and [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=397.56s)]
*  Devante Adams, they, it, it, it's really, it's, it's all there, you know? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=401.88s)]
*  So, um, you know, I, I think, I think what's maybe most interesting about this [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=406.88s)]
*  whole thing to me is where the Steelers are and that they are so leveraged for [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=412.76s)]
*  right now, um, TJ watt wants a new contract. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=416.88s)]
*  He's turning 31 Minka Fitzpatrick's turning 29. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=420.16s)]
*  I mean, cam Hayward isn't on the back nine. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=423.44s)]
*  He's, I mean, basically walking to the clubhouse now, like he, this is probably [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=425.84s)]
*  his last shot, they trade for DK Metcalf who's a third contract guy and has had [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=429.88s)]
*  some injury issues like this really, I mean, this is a team, like if this group's [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=434.84s)]
*  going to win, it sort of has to be right now. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=439.52s)]
*  And so, you know, I think a big part of, you know, the Steelers logic, and I felt [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=443.0s)]
*  like all along, like they were going to be a contender for whatever big name [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=447.2s)]
*  quarterback became available. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=450.8s)]
*  Um, is Kirk Cousins a swing for the fences? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=452.64s)]
*  I mean, waiting on that one, by the way. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=456.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=458.88s)]
*  And like to me, like that's the thing with Kirk. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=459.2s)]
*  It's like, Kirk is like more, you may be more likely to hit a double with Kirk [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=461.16s)]
*  and less likely to hit a home run. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=465.48s)]
*  If that makes sense, you know, where with Aaron, maybe you're more likely to strike [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=467.2s)]
*  out, but at least you're swinging for the fences when you've been really average [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=471.12s)]
*  at that position since Ben Roethlisberger retired. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=476.16s)]
*  So you're basically only in the torn Achilles recovery, old quarterback [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=478.79999999999995s)]
*  business at this point. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=483.32s)]
*  I mean, what else is available though? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=484.84s)]
*  I mean, if it wasn't going to be Stafford, right? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=486.47999999999996s)]
*  Like, and I think Stafford was the most logical answer for a lot of different [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=488.52s)]
*  teams, you know, and the Raiders and Giants were really in that one. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=492.64s)]
*  Um, the Steelers dipped their toe in it. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=496.2s)]
*  I like, there just aren't that many options, you know? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=498.52s)]
*  So it was a bad year to be looking at quarterback in the draft, especially, you [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=502.32s)]
*  know, if you didn't have the first overall pick and the veteran options, again, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=508.08s)]
*  like there were a lot of, I mean, the Rams, when the Rams, when, when the Rams [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=513.1999999999999s)]
*  made the offer, they did to Stafford, you know, back in March, it was with it in [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=517.76s)]
*  the back of their head. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=522.48s)]
*  This guy doesn't want to leave Los Angeles and this guy doesn't want to play [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=523.4399999999999s)]
*  for anybody but Sean McEvoy. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=527.28s)]
*  And the Giants and the Giants had the, yeah, and the Giants had the same, the [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=529.28s)]
*  Giants had the same like sort of thing in the back of their head as they were, as [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=533.0s)]
*  they were pursuing them Raiders too. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=536.6400000000001s)]
*  It was like, yeah, we're really going after this, but this guy's going to wind [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=538.08s)]
*  up back in LA. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=542.48s)]
*  So, you know, if you take Stafford off the table, then it really is it's cousins. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=543.36s)]
*  It's, it's, it's, it's Rogers. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=548.36s)]
*  And then, I mean, now after that, you're talking about getting into like Joe [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=550.84s)]
*  Flacco territory. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=555.6400000000001s)]
*  There just wasn't a lot out there. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=556.8000000000001s)]
*  So just all, all probably washed up guys. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=558.6s)]
*  So the Steelers died in the last month of the season. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=561.36s)]
*  And one of the people, one of the things, one of the reasons they died is T.J. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=564.32s)]
*  Watt died as the season went along and the last, I don't know, 40, 35, 40% of his [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=567.1600000000001s)]
*  season, he just didn't seem disruptive anymore. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=572.44s)]
*  And I know they, you know, maybe under the, under the radar blaming, but the Russell [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=575.9200000000001s)]
*  Wilson thing got weird. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=579.8000000000001s)]
*  Team wasn't that good to begin with. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=581.2800000000001s)]
*  The schedule got really unfavorable for them down the stretch, et cetera, et [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=583.24s)]
*  cetera. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=587.1600000000001s)]
*  But like I'm looking at Fandl and they are over eight and a half wins. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=587.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=593.24s)]
*  Which with in the Tom and era for me is just the blind. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=593.76s)]
*  I don't even have to look at that checking it. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=597.36s)]
*  That's plus one 25 on Fandl because all the action has been on the under, which [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=600.44s)]
*  is now minus one 45. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=605.2s)]
*  I don't know how much that's just because Basin Rudolph's the quarterback right [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=610.0s)]
*  now. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=613.0s)]
*  But could it also be what happened to them in the last month, the last season [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=614.4s)]
*  and the fact that you can point to a couple of AFC teams and go, well, that [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=619.24s)]
*  team's going to, the paths are going to be better. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=623.72s)]
*  The jets are going to be better. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=625.2800000000001s)]
*  They're in the same thing with the Ravens, the Bengals, they might fix their [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=626.84s)]
*  defense. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=629.6800000000001s)]
*  We'll see with Hendrickson. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=630.12s)]
*  Browns might actually have a little more stability, a quarterback AFC south is [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=631.9200000000001s)]
*  going to be better, except for Houston. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=637.08s)]
*  You go on through and it's like, maybe this is going to run out this year. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=639.2s)]
*  I'm just starting my homework and it makes, they make me nervous. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=643.12s)]
*  They're there. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=646.4s)]
*  So like I would, you know, I would say like they're, they're offensive lines [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=647.3199999999999s)]
*  should be a lot better. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=651.04s)]
*  Like, and they've actually drafted. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=652.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=653.92s)]
*  If Troy Fittano, you know, works out for them at tackle, you know, they've got [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=654.24s)]
*  Broderick Jones, that's two first round picks at tackle. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=658.12s)]
*  They should be a strong Zach Frazier might be the best young center in football. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=660.4s)]
*  Like they, they have a chance to have the best offensive line they've had in over [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=663.76s)]
*  a decade. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=667.3199999999999s)]
*  And then if DK Metcalf comes through, and I know I'm talking a lot of ifs here, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=668.6s)]
*  right? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=672.0s)]
*  Like if DK Metcalf comes through, if TJ Watt is himself again, if, if it's [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=672.24s)]
*  Patrick, if Aaron Rodgers is still alive. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=676.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=678.96s)]
*  So like there's all of these ifs, but if, but if you're them, like what's your [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=679.64s)]
*  other choice, you know what I mean? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=683.64s)]
*  It's either, it was either this, like take this big swing at quarterback and try to [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=684.88s)]
*  get it right and try to squeeze a championship run out of this core that [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=688.6s)]
*  you've had together for the last few years or blow it up. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=692.76s)]
*  And like, that's why I look at this as like, that's it's a, it's the one team [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=696.0s)]
*  where you look at it. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=700.84s)]
*  I was like, that's a team that like, that's a really worthy swing because now [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=701.4s)]
*  at least like you're taking that swing with TJ Watt and Fitzpatrick and like [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=705.56s)]
*  some really great players they've had there for a long time. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=709.68s)]
*  Um, I don't, I don't mind this swing if I'm the Steelers and look like I think [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=712.8s)]
*  people there would tell you that the Russell Wilson thing undermined so many [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=718.04s)]
*  things in the last month of the season. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=723.64s)]
*  And that a lot of that building really wanted them to go back to Justin Fields. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=725.8s)]
*  And it was, it was something where, I mean, Tomlin was kind of again, all [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=730.3599999999999s)]
*  on his own on that one. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=735.44s)]
*  And I think it's part of the reason why. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=736.72s)]
*  It Tomlin likes should do or something like, like he likes to do or going [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=740.12s)]
*  into the draft, but I don't think Tomlin wanted to, I don't, I don't think [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=744.32s)]
*  he wanted to like press that button again, a quarterback after what happened [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=748.8800000000001s)]
*  with Russell at the end of the year last year. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=752.6800000000001s)]
*  So there's some dynamics there where it's like, I mean, there's some stuff [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=754.24s)]
*  that happened at the end of the year in games where it was just like, man, like [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=757.8800000000001s)]
*  if we were just like average at that position, or we should, we're just running [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=761.52s)]
*  the running things as they were supposed to be run, we might've been okay. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=764.96s)]
*  And like, so I think their thought is a, if we can get like 80, 85% of what [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=768.88s)]
*  Aaron Rogers was three years ago, like we might have a Superbowl team, which [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=776.08s)]
*  you can argue whether they would or not. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=780.2s)]
*  But I think when you, when, if you're them and you're looking at it with this [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=781.88s)]
*  group of players that you've had for the last few years, and this might be your [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=785.2s)]
*  last shot before you really like go through like a real reset, then it's [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=788.92s)]
*  worth taking that swing. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=794.88s)]
*  Well, philosophically, they just feel like they're one of the teams that have [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=796.64s)]
*  decided it doesn't make sense to spend a lot of money at quarterback unless the [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=800.72s)]
*  guy's awesome. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=803.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=805.08s)]
*  And we can patch this together, put together the rest of the team around and [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=805.4399999999999s)]
*  try to get to 10, 11 wins every year, and then hope we can cross our fingers. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=808.76s)]
*  Here's the issue for them. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=812.6s)]
*  I mean, if, if I asked you on Fandl right now, who had better odds to make the [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=814.52s)]
*  playoffs, the Patriots or the Steelers, who would you say? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=820.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, because you're asking me, I know it's the Patriots. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=823.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=825.5999999999999s)]
*  I probably could have framed that better. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=825.88s)]
*  I should be better at this after 19 years. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=827.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=830.0799999999999s)]
*  The Patriots are plus 158 and the Steelers are plus 164. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=830.3199999999999s)]
*  Now a lot of that has to do with this schedule. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=834.1199999999999s)]
*  This schedule the Patriots have is it's comical. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=836.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=839.76s)]
*  Like you're like, is this real? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=840.04s)]
*  Where are they? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=841.52s)]
*  Oh, there's Buffalo. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=842.0799999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=843.04s)]
*  There's, but you go through it and it's like, they're favored apparently. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=843.36s)]
*  And 11 games. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=847.4s)]
*  I think it's 13 of the 17 right now or 12, something like that. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=848.72s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=851.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=852.52s)]
*  Well, we'll see with Pittsburgh. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=852.92s)]
*  All right. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=853.84s)]
*  What's your number two thing? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=854.04s)]
*  So my number two thing, the Cowboys a year after Jerry Jones famously used [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=856.28s)]
*  the phrase all in actually pulled an all in move and traded for George Pickens. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=860.84s)]
*  And this one is really interesting to me because there are another team where [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=865.84s)]
*  like what all the things you said about the Steelers, I think sort of apply to [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=871.1999999999999s)]
*  the Cowboys, right? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=873.92s)]
*  Like, is this group that they have right now going to be good enough? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=874.92s)]
*  Um, and like, is there something that you can do to try to put [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=879.56s)]
*  that group over the top? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=883.92s)]
*  And so I think the answer was like, we got to get Dak Prescott some more help. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=885.48s)]
*  And so that when they went into the draft, they looked at it like, we [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=890.8399999999999s)]
*  either want to come out with, come out of this with a lineman or a, or a receiver. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=893.8399999999999s)]
*  And I think if Ted Arroyo, Macmillan who went eighth to the Panthers made it to [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=898.9599999999999s)]
*  12, like maybe that would have been a consideration, but they were sort of [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=902.52s)]
*  looking at it as this mosaic. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=906.4799999999999s)]
*  It's like, well, we still have, there were, I think there were a handful of [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=908.1999999999999s)]
*  receivers they were considering in trade, um, veteran receivers that they had [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=912.28s)]
*  studied and they had talked to teams about. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=915.92s)]
*  And so Macmillan's gone. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=918.4399999999999s)]
*  They liked Tyler Booker. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=922.24s)]
*  They just lost Zach Martin. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=923.5999999999999s)]
*  They draft Tyler Booker. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=924.8s)]
*  And then on the back end, they go and make the deal for George Pickens, which [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=926.24s)]
*  here's the most interesting thing about it to me. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=930.64s)]
*  I'm cracking my neck as we get ready for this discussion. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=933.32s)]
*  So, so, so this one, this one. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=936.0s)]
*  So the reason, one of the main reasons the Steelers got rid of George Pickens [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=939.36s)]
*  is because like the issues with him, a lot of times have come out, come down [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=943.72s)]
*  to his role in the offense, the direction of the offense and how much he's getting [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=949.68s)]
*  the ball, which is normal with a lot of receivers. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=954.44s)]
*  He's very over the top with it, which makes him worse than most with it [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=957.7600000000001s)]
*  when it comes to that stuff. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=960.96s)]
*  And so when they traded for DK Metcalf, the thing was it was like, he plays [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=961.9200000000001s)]
*  the same position, not that, not that they're just receivers, the same [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=967.0s)]
*  receiver spot, running a straight line down the sideline position, the X [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=970.6800000000001s)]
*  receiver position, right? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=973.7600000000001s)]
*  So they're both X receivers. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=975.2800000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=977.36s)]
*  So now you've got to figure out a way to play them together. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=977.72s)]
*  And now George Pickens is in a contract year. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=980.6s)]
*  So do you think if he goes through a two or a three or a four week stretch in the [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=984.1999999999999s)]
*  middle of October with say three catches, and is he going to be okay with that [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=989.4799999999999s)]
*  just because we got another receiver? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=995.52s)]
*  Is he going to be okay? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=997.4399999999999s)]
*  Also, as we discussed earlier, the quarterback situation might [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=997.92s)]
*  not be to George's liking. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1001.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1003.3199999999999s)]
*  So to say the least. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1003.7199999999999s)]
*  So is he going to be okay? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1005.0799999999999s)]
*  Is he going to be okay with, if he wasn't okay with it before, now in a contract [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1006.4799999999999s)]
*  year with a hundred million dollars on the line, is he suddenly going to be okay [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1011.3199999999999s)]
*  with no, that's fine. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1016.64s)]
*  I'm okay with DK Metcalf's on the team now. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1018.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1021.24s)]
*  So like that's part of the logic for the Steelers and moving off of them and saying [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1021.52s)]
*  we're going to be better off with Calvin Austin and Roman Wilson and whoever else. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1025.16s)]
*  Well, can I interject one thing here? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1029.72s)]
*  But when he started the Thursday night, that last play of the game against the [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1032.36s)]
*  Browns, when instead of trying to go for the hill Mary, he just chose to get in a [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1035.8799999999999s)]
*  fight with the D back that he'd been waiting to fight with for an hour. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1040.48s)]
*  That to me is like, it's the beginning of the end, at least with George and [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1044.6s)]
*  Pittsburgh, that was such a weird play. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1047.72s)]
*  So there's that, but like, and there's the lack of effort blocking sometimes [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1049.84s)]
*  all of that, right? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1054.44s)]
*  Like, so like that all exists. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1055.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1057.16s)]
*  So if, if that, if that, that whole thing was going to be the ball, be, be, be a [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1057.44s)]
*  problem in a contract year in Pittsburgh, who's one of the highest volume receivers [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1062.88s)]
*  in football, as far as targets go? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1067.92s)]
*  Well, CD lamb. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1069.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1071.64s)]
*  So like, is this now going to be okay with him? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1072.0400000000002s)]
*  Again, he's in a new place. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1075.3200000000002s)]
*  He's with new offensive coaches who are in their first year, truly running the [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1077.1200000000001s)]
*  offense, cause Mike McCarthy's gone now. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1081.0800000000002s)]
*  Um, and he's not getting the ball with all that money in the lines. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1083.52s)]
*  He's suddenly going to be okay with that. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1086.8000000000002s)]
*  Like that. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1088.96s)]
*  You don't think they're going to take care of him as part of this deal? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1089.3200000000002s)]
*  Cause that was my assumption. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1091.72s)]
*  Not right now. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1093.68s)]
*  They're not. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1094.48s)]
*  I mean, they're going to see how it goes. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1094.8400000000001s)]
*  And like I said, like everything, everything's going to be in May and June. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1096.2s)]
*  Like, like it's all, it's really easy for everybody to have their arms around [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1101.3600000000001s)]
*  each other and say, this is all going to work out in May and June. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1104.76s)]
*  It's a little different to project these things in September and October. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1107.8s)]
*  They still have the Mike Parsons thing floating around out there too. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1111.48s)]
*  Like, and I, and I know like one thing that they had sort of discussed with, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1115.52s)]
*  with George and his people was, are you comfortable going into the year [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1119.64s)]
*  without a new contract? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1123.0800000000002s)]
*  And the answer was yes. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1124.28s)]
*  And so like, if they go into the year, so like, but you can look at that both ways. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1125.9199999999998s)]
*  Right? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1130.8s)]
*  Like is it, are you going to get a super motivated guy who's going to be out to [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1131.04s)]
*  prove to everybody he's team first? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1134.36s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1136.04s)]
*  I think the people in Pittsburgh would tell you what might be more likely is if [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1137.32s)]
*  he's not getting the ball a month or two into the season, you could have a problem. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1140.7199999999998s)]
*  So that's sort of like, we also have a, we have a 30 year, maybe even longer, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1144.0s)]
*  um, sample size with receivers like this who aren't getting paid or aren't getting [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1149.6s)]
*  the contracts they want, Dan aren't getting the ball enough and kind of how [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1154.44s)]
*  that's going to go. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1158.04s)]
*  I just, to me, like from afar, it's just like a typical Jerry Jones move, but [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1158.64s)]
*  it's a shine. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1164.16s)]
*  It's another shiny new toy. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1164.64s)]
*  It's like when, when the bark box comes from my dog every month and it's like, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1166.1200000000001s)]
*  Hey, it's a newspaper. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1170.2s)]
*  That's a squeaky toy. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1171.28s)]
*  And my dog will be excited about it for 20 minutes. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1172.24s)]
*  And then moves on to the next thing. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1174.8s)]
*  That's how he's been in free agency almost every year. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1176.3600000000001s)]
*  I thought they, I mean, running back to me was a way more important. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1179.3200000000002s)]
*  They, the running backs murdered them last year. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1182.56s)]
*  They addressed that to the offensive line is in close to where it used to be. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1184.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1188.96s)]
*  Um, and I don't see any scenario where they're one of the top two teams in the [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1189.32s)]
*  NFC East. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1193.92s)]
*  So you're just going into a season, knowing you're number three and maybe even [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1195.0s)]
*  worse if the giants are a little bit better right away than people think. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1198.92s)]
*  So I don't, I do not feel good if I'm Dallas. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1201.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1204.32s)]
*  And, and that division, by the way, you've seen the schedule for that division. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1204.6399999999999s)]
*  They're playing the NFC North and the AFC West. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1208.92s)]
*  So brutal. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1212.52s)]
*  It's the worst one of all the schedules. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1213.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1215.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1216.12s)]
*  So, so, I mean, it's going to be really interesting. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1216.48s)]
*  And I think a lot of it for them is counting on Brian Schottenheimer as a culture [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1218.92s)]
*  builder that he'll be able to build the right environment. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1222.56s)]
*  But I always go back, but I always go back to like, I don't like the idea of [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1224.8799999999999s)]
*  like the, the, the receiver, that the Steelers, that Mike Tomlin is ready to get [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1232.68s)]
*  rid of, like the history of that's not great, you know, like when, when Mike [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1236.76s)]
*  Tomlin, I mean, back in 2015, 2016, like, did anybody think of like Antonio [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1240.92s)]
*  Brown and Le'Veon Bell as bad guys? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1248.52s)]
*  It wasn't until they were gone, really, you know, or disruptive in some way. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1251.16s)]
*  Disruptive at the end, like Bell got disruptive at the end, but it's like, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1255.5600000000002s)]
*  generally when, when, when the Steelers are ready to walk away from a guy for [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1259.0800000000002s)]
*  those sorts of reasons or a guy who has that sort of background, generally it [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1262.96s)]
*  doesn't work out for the next team that gets them. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1267.64s)]
*  Dallas is, you could get a, and they're over under is eight and a half [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1270.24s)]
*  playoffs, not looking great. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1275.1200000000001s)]
*  I, I, I'm, I'm down on them. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1276.3600000000001s)]
*  What's your third thing? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1278.48s)]
*  Um, Derek Carr retired, which I feel like this, maybe because it happened on a [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1280.3200000000002s)]
*  Saturday, kind of like flew under the radar, you know what I mean? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1283.6000000000001s)]
*  Like, but, um, it's one of a number of quarterback situations. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1286.72s)]
*  I kind of grouped this together. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1291.04s)]
*  This is cheating a little bit by me, but the Saints, the Vikings, the Browns, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1292.04s)]
*  like I, there are, it feels like a few teams where the quarterback situations [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1296.04s)]
*  are going to be really interesting. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1300.96s)]
*  Um, and or Macabre or, or, or Grizzly. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1302.56s)]
*  I don't know what the right adjective is, but there's going to be some tough ones. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1308.16s)]
*  I mean, I throw the Viking. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1311.92s)]
*  I am hesitant to throw the Vikings in there. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1313.36s)]
*  Don't be hesitant. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1315.12s)]
*  What? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1316.04s)]
*  We don't know if JJ McCarthy coming off the tour at ACL is going to be good. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1316.28s)]
*  And the reason, the reason I throw them in there with the other two is because [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1319.76s)]
*  the expectations are so high there. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1323.92s)]
*  Like if you're a player on that team, that's a 14 win team last year. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1325.72s)]
*  Like that's not the type of team that like can throw the year overboard in [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1329.84s)]
*  the name of quarterback development. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1335.08s)]
*  So, you know, what does that look like? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1336.52s)]
*  And, you know, I, I know like JJ fought through a lot last year. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1338.6000000000001s)]
*  He lost a lot of weight, like, and he had a lot of ups and downs, like [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1341.4s)]
*  coming back from that injury. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1345.08s)]
*  And, you know, obviously at the second follow-up surgery is more of a cleanup. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1346.96s)]
*  He's in a much better place right now. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1350.04s)]
*  And I don't think there's a better place in the league for a young quarterback to [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1352.04s)]
*  be, especially because of what they did with their offensive line and signing [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1354.68s)]
*  Ryan and Kelly and Will Fries and drafting Donovan Jackson and, you know, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1358.1200000000001s)]
*  getting Christian Derrisaw back, obviously it'll help a lot, but the Vikings [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1362.04s)]
*  are the one where I look at it and it's like, so much is going to hinge. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1365.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean, that could be a Superbowl team. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1369.28s)]
*  If JJ McCarthy has a great year or the quarterback position [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1372.1200000000001s)]
*  could really hold them back. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1377.24s)]
*  Plus, especially you had cousins for a few years there who regardless of [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1378.3600000000001s)]
*  how you feel about him was still a significantly above average quarterback. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1382.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1386.28s)]
*  Then you get Darlo for four months last year, who was excellent. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1386.52s)]
*  And now you have a new guy who God only knows coming off ACL. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1390.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1394.28s)]
*  So I got to look at those three teams, the guy, the Saints to me, I mean, like [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1394.6s)]
*  Tyler Shuck, Spencer Rattler, I mean, Jake Handers hurt now. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1398.96s)]
*  Well, can you explain the salary cap piece of it? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1402.6399999999999s)]
*  Cause wasn't it in a weird way, a great thing that Derek Hart retired? [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1404.72s)]
*  Cause I think the Saints were going to suck either way. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1407.9199999999998s)]
*  So does that help them? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1410.1599999999999s)]
*  It was one of the more bizarre endings to a career I've seen in 20 years covering this. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1412.48s)]
*  I mean, it started with, if you go back to the end of the season, like I think [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1417.8799999999999s)]
*  like Kellan Moore committed, but didn't really commit to Carr as the starter in [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1423.8799999999999s)]
*  the introductory press conference. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1429.8799999999999s)]
*  Then there were some whispers that Carr wanted to trade and some teams sniffed [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1434.72s)]
*  around that. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1439.8s)]
*  They sniffed around and it smelled like sewage. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1441.12s)]
*  They were like, Oh. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1444.48s)]
*  And then there was, well, Carr wants a raise because to affirm like, this is my team. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1446.28s)]
*  Then we got to confirm that he was so good the last two years. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1453.9199999999998s)]
*  So let's give him the Carr keys. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1457.96s)]
*  Then after that, then after that they convert his contract, which basically [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1459.84s)]
*  means he's on the team without really consulting with them, which they can do. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1464.0s)]
*  It's a contract mechanism, but it basically locked them in where it converted. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1467.12s)]
*  It took like basically, you know, 95% of his set 98% of his salary and [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1471.6399999999999s)]
*  turned it into a signing bonus. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1477.28s)]
*  So they F themselves for this season with how they did that because they didn't [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1479.0s)]
*  think the season was going to go on. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1483.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, they had that. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1485.28s)]
*  And that restructures that that restructure pushes the cap money forward, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1486.3999999999999s)]
*  but it basically locks them in with the team. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1490.32s)]
*  Now where they are saved by this is that they don't have to spend that money now. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1491.92s)]
*  Now they, they sunk a $10 million roster bonus into him. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1497.7600000000002s)]
*  And part of the separation agreement is he gets to keep the $10 million roster bonus. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1501.3200000000002s)]
*  But it's a buyout. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1506.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1507.64s)]
*  For the most part. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1508.0s)]
*  And now, and now they move on and we'll see, I mean, Tyler Shuck was in college [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1508.88s)]
*  for seven years, he was at four different schools. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1513.68s)]
*  I've actually, I've heard he has, I think it's four degrees, which is pretty wild. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1516.36s)]
*  But like he was, he was Justin Herbert's backup for two years at Oregon, which is, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1521.36s)]
*  which gives you an idea how old he is. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1526.24s)]
*  And then you have him competing with Spencer Rattler and you know, you see [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1529.2s)]
*  where that goes and that looks like, is this a full reset year for them where [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1533.0s)]
*  they're in the mix for one of the quarterbacks next year? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1538.0s)]
*  You know, obviously there's a quarterback who could be in the draft. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1541.48s)]
*  I don't think he will. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1544.08s)]
*  But a quarterback who could be in the draft next year with a very famous last [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1544.92s)]
*  name that has ties to that organization. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1548.3200000000002s)]
*  Why don't you say that's the number one I could see them tanking once we get to [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1551.0s)]
*  November NFL team that we have, I can't even think of another one that would be [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1554.96s)]
*  a bigger suspect. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1558.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1560.16s)]
*  I mean, like they, I'd have to think about that one. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1560.48s)]
*  I mean, I don't know how many teams there are that are like just outright in that [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1564.92s)]
*  position and need a quarterback might wind up being in that position where [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1568.8000000000002s)]
*  they're not very good. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1573.1599999999999s)]
*  And you never know like the way these things are going to, going to play out. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1574.52s)]
*  And Kellen Moore is a first year coach. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1578.2s)]
*  Obviously can't afford for them. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1579.76s)]
*  It's, it's hard for him to be number one. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1581.8s)]
*  Cause like, even if you look at a team like Tennessee, they just got their [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1584.2s)]
*  quarterback, right? [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1587.9199999999998s)]
*  So it's not like they'd be like, Oh, I hope we suck. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1589.56s)]
*  Carolina has a quarterback. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1591.6s)]
*  Chicago has a quarterback. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1593.3999999999999s)]
*  Cleveland would be the only other one, right? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1594.52s)]
*  Vegas should be competitive. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1596.72s)]
*  I think more competitive with Gino as a quarterback. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1598.1599999999999s)]
*  So yeah, and I think that's the only one that's going to be a big, big, big [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1600.12s)]
*  one. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1602.52s)]
*  I mean, Cleveland would be the other one if that thing crashes and burns. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1602.8s)]
*  They just took two. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1606.16s)]
*  Um, yeah. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1607.6000000000001s)]
*  And the only other one I can think of is the Colts. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1608.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1612.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1612.88s)]
*  It's probably an AFC South team that will be have the number one pick next year. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1613.2s)]
*  It'd be my guess. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1616.8s)]
*  The Colts have the Colts cook, the Colts, the Colts are interesting. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1617.44s)]
*  Cause that could be, I mean, obviously with, with new people, with a new owner, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1620.88s)]
*  a new principal owner in charge. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1625.8s)]
*  And then like the GM has been there now for Chris Ballard has been there for, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1628.32s)]
*  this will be his ninth year there. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1632.76s)]
*  And they really haven't accomplished a ton. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1634.6s)]
*  Um, if he's in trouble, then maybe the coach is in trouble. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1636.84s)]
*  It could, if things get off to a bad start, it there could get messy in a hurry. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1639.4399999999998s)]
*  He's good at telling everybody how well he's doing though. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1643.36s)]
*  Chris Ballard. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1645.84s)]
*  It's going great. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1647.9199999999998s)]
*  He seems like a lot of people love him. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1650.0s)]
*  And every year it's like a victory lap about how good their draft or for agency [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1652.9599999999998s)]
*  was and then, you know, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1656.4399999999998s)]
*  it's hard cause like, I mean, like they, it really, while luck was still a [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1658.3999999999999s)]
*  quarterback, it looked like it was really going in a great direction. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1662.72s)]
*  And then, you know, you have the surprise retirement, um, two years, seven years [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1667.48s)]
*  ago, and that was, that's the thing is like, it had been a crutch for a while. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1671.3999999999999s)]
*  And it can't be a crutch anymore. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1676.0s)]
*  It's been way too long. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1677.6399999999999s)]
*  No, you look at that division. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1678.8799999999999s)]
*  Cause I think Houston's, I really liked Houston last year. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1680.6799999999998s)]
*  So Houston might not enough. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1683.9199999999998s)]
*  I've been, they make me really nervous, right? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1686.08s)]
*  Not enough people are talking about how I think Houston could bounce [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1688.32s)]
*  back in a really big way. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1691.6s)]
*  Oh, make the case. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1693.08s)]
*  So like, I think Houston, I think Houston's got a top five defense. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1695.28s)]
*  And I think with the level of like, like the young core players, like [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1699.72s)]
*  Will Anderson and Derek Stangley and they bring to Neil Hunter back. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1705.68s)]
*  And they've got like a lot of nice ancillary pieces on defense too. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1709.8s)]
*  Really good. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1714.56s)]
*  They they've got the defense yet. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1715.8799999999999s)]
*  They've got the defense where they want it. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1717.68s)]
*  And part of the reason they traded Laramie Tunsil was because they felt like [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1719.4s)]
*  the culture in their offensive line room was broken and that they weren't able [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1722.96s)]
*  to kind of match like the culture they built on defense on offense. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1727.44s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1731.28s)]
*  And so they trade Laramie Tunsil. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1731.84s)]
*  They bring in a million different tackles to try and fix it. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1734.2s)]
*  They draft the kid from Minnesota. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1736.32s)]
*  They bring in Trent Brown and Cam Robinson. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1737.56s)]
*  They just throw a bunch of darts to tackle. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1739.8s)]
*  They bring in a new offensive coordinator from the Rams and Nick Kaley. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1741.2s)]
*  And they take two wide receivers from the same college. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1745.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1748.0800000000002s)]
*  Who I think have a chance to be really like, if you look at the history from [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1748.4s)]
*  that school, like a lot of guys from that school come in and produce right away. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1751.24s)]
*  So it wouldn't shock me like as like complimentary pieces to, to Nico Collins, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1755.0800000000002s)]
*  if those guys are playing pretty well right away and you have CJ Stroud. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1760.16s)]
*  I, I look at it and I'm like, a lot of people have totally forgotten about them. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1764.52s)]
*  I think they have an elite defense. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1769.4s)]
*  And if your problem is offense and you've got CJ Stroud to build around and you're [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1771.3999999999999s)]
*  bringing in a coordinator from the Rams, who I think is really capable and has [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1775.8799999999999s)]
*  both like the Josh McDaniels and Sean McVay background and you play in a weak [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1780.28s)]
*  division and like as much as people thought they were not the same last year, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1785.56s)]
*  they were down by one point going into the fourth quarter of the [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1791.44s)]
*  divisional rounded arrow. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1794.48s)]
*  I was just going to, I was going to say that. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1795.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1797.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, that chief's game is the best case for that. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1798.1200000000001s)]
*  They're actually going to be good this year and they're a little, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1801.28s)]
*  little closer than people think. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1803.3600000000001s)]
*  The other case would be the division. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1804.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1806.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1806.96s)]
*  So like, like it's, I think we look at it like it was broken because our [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1807.2s)]
*  expectations were so high after CJ's rookie year, D'Amico's first year. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1811.2s)]
*  And I'm, I, I just don't know that teams are looking at that. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1816.28s)]
*  Like, I don't know if people are looking at that team enough and saying, you [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1819.44s)]
*  know what, like there's still a lot of like really good stuff in place here. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1822.32s)]
*  And if the young quarterback bounces backwards, CJ was doing incredibly high [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1826.72s)]
*  level shit and 23 Mike, that could be a dangerous team. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1830.2s)]
*  Now, do they break into the Buffalo, Baltimore, Kansas city? [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1834.76s)]
*  Um, do they break into, to, to, to that tier? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1838.8799999999999s)]
*  Um, you know, Cincinnati could get back into that tier, like maybe, maybe not. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1843.0s)]
*  But I think they're like, if you look at like the teams in the AFC, like they [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1847.08s)]
*  may have the best chance to do it of the, of the teams that are right below that. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1850.32s)]
*  So the division odds, do you know what their odds are for that division? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1853.92s)]
*  It's gotta be, it's gotta be an overwhelming favorite, right? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1858.04s)]
*  So that's what I thought too. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1860.16s)]
*  Went to Fandel, they're plus one 15 when they have CSEF. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1861.88s)]
*  I don't know who else you would bet in the AFC South unless you wanted to [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1864.84s)]
*  really talk yourself into Jacksonville. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1868.44s)]
*  I was going to say, is there like a lot of belief in James Gladstone [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1870.4s)]
*  and Liam Cohen now? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1873.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1874.44s)]
*  Or is there belief that that trade might, we actually might be like, wow, Travis [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1875.68s)]
*  Center is like pretty good, but holy shit. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1881.8799999999999s)]
*  They gave up a lot for that guy. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1884.52s)]
*  He's done jumping out of my TV. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1886.08s)]
*  I can't wait to watch him, but I just, I think Jacksonville's problem, like [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1888.12s)]
*  under the last regime, you know, the, and this is where I think like there's [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1892.72s)]
*  some cleaning up that needs to be done. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1896.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1898.2s)]
*  Is like, they paid a lot of good players, great money. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1898.72s)]
*  Like there are guys, there are, there are guys in that roster that they paid, like [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1903.08s)]
*  their franchise players when they're just pretty good. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1906.12s)]
*  Um, and you know, Trevor Lawrence in that list. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1908.76s)]
*  Cause I mean, you, you could, you could, I think, you know, they, they pay Walker [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1911.0s)]
*  a little to play left tackle after he played for like 15 minutes for them. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1915.3999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1918.6399999999999s)]
*  Tyson Campbell at corner. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1919.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean, Christian Kirk is gone, but I think he'd be another example of that. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1921.08s)]
*  Um, you know, like there was just a lot of examples of like, I mean, you could [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1924.36s)]
*  even, you could even like argue that, that, that Walker is one of those guys. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1928.6799999999998s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1933.4399999999998s)]
*  Like, so like, are they just, do they just have like a collection of pretty good [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1934.12s)]
*  players and they don't have like the types of, they don't have like Houston has [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1939.04s)]
*  Will Andrew, like I said, Will Anderson, Derek Stingley, Nico Collins, CJ Stroud. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1943.56s)]
*  I mean, they have an identity of this. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1947.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1950.52s)]
*  Like how many players on Houston's roster? [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1950.76s)]
*  Like if you rank the two rosters, Houston, Jacksonville, how many Texans would you [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1953.3999999999999s)]
*  have to go through to get to the first Jaguar? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1956.84s)]
*  Oof. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1959.2399999999998s)]
*  You know, all right. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1960.2399999999998s)]
*  Why sidetracked it? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1961.32s)]
*  You have two more on your list. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1962.1599999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1963.28s)]
*  So number four, Caleb Williams is in the news again. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1963.84s)]
*  Um, and this is an excerpt from, I think our mutual friend, Seth Wickersham's book. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1967.48s)]
*  Um, and it was for those who missed it, um, before the 2024 draft, he and his dad [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1971.56s)]
*  had looked at the idea of, um, he and his dad had looked at the idea of forcing [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1977.8799999999999s)]
*  their way out, I guess what you would call it is pulling a needle high and, um, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1984.2s)]
*  had their eyes on the Vikings and, um, the Vikings had actually researched Caleb too. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1988.48s)]
*  That was the, that was of course the draft they took JJ McCarthy in. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1992.96s)]
*  Um, so like this has become like a little bit of like a firestorm in Chicago. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=1997.2s)]
*  And I think it's sort of, I think the first signal of like what's to come for Caleb [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2002.24s)]
*  there, and I think he is such a high end talent. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2008.52s)]
*  Like when you, wait, when you say what's to come, you mean [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2013.04s)]
*  venom and disappointment? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2015.76s)]
*  And just know like just, just the level of like the training wheels are off. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2017.32s)]
*  Now the excuses are gone. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2021.08s)]
*  From a scrutiny standpoint. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2022.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2024.0s)]
*  Like, like now it's like, you have to start playing well. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2024.4s)]
*  Um, you know, we've seen the year two jump. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2027.04s)]
*  I mean, this might get you excited about Drake too, but we've seen the year two [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2029.92s)]
*  jump where I'm more excited. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2033.16s)]
*  I mean, I mean, but you look at it like Patrick Mahomes, MVP of the league, um, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2034.96s)]
*  his second year Lamar Jackson, MVP of the league, his second year, Joe Burroughs [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2039.28s)]
*  and the, in the Superbowl in his second year, Josh Allen, 10 wins and in the [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2042.76s)]
*  playoffs in his second year, Drake may is going to be in his second year. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2046.64s)]
*  And so like, you look at all of this, right? [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2050.52s)]
*  Like, and so like, is, is Caleb going to take that step? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2052.2799999999997s)]
*  And I think, I think this is like a, like this, this is a scrutiny that [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2055.4s)]
*  Caleb's going to be under because they fix so many things. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2059.48s)]
*  They drafted Colston Loveland, 10th overall Luther Burden with their second pick. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2062.2799999999997s)]
*  They traded for Joe Tooney and Jonah Jackson to play guard. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2066.48s)]
*  They signed Drew Dahlman from Atlanta to play center. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2069.92s)]
*  Um, they hire Ben Johnson, which is a huge part of it. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2072.7599999999998s)]
*  They removed every excuse he had coaching, offensive line, weapons, whatever. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2076.3999999999996s)]
*  It's see he has everything now. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2081.3599999999997s)]
*  He has, and you look at it and it's like, this is a, this now looks like they [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2082.9599999999996s)]
*  should be able to get a very clean read on what Caleb can be. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2088.04s)]
*  And it was interesting because I did a little reporting on this last week where, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2091.4799999999996s)]
*  um, you know, I kind of like asked around like, um, you know, what they've [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2095.12s)]
*  been working on with Caleb and the stuff that they've been working on was really [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2098.24s)]
*  how you carry yourself as a franchise quarterback and how you, and how you have [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2103.08s)]
*  to like the command that you have to have to be a franchise quarterback. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2107.68s)]
*  And, you know, a couple of the examples that were brought up to me, they watched [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2110.72s)]
*  tape of him taking sacks and how long it took for him to come off the ground. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2113.3999999999996s)]
*  And basically the point they were trying to make to him was last year was a tough [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2118.24s)]
*  year. We understand your offensive coordinator gets fired. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2121.3599999999997s)]
*  Then your head coach gets fired. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2124.2s)]
*  Your offensive line wasn't very good. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2125.9199999999996s)]
*  We get it. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2127.4399999999996s)]
*  It's like, but if you're lying on the ground, you know, for an extended period [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2128.3199999999997s)]
*  of time, you're not picking yourself up off the ground. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2132.7599999999998s)]
*  That's going to resonate with the rest of the team. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2135.3199999999997s)]
*  That's the sort of thing that's going to lie. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2137.16s)]
*  And so it's like, you need to be, you need to be popping up off the ground [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2138.68s)]
*  after hits. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2142.3199999999997s)]
*  Another show them, Jake, show them Drake may tapes of him popping off the ground [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2143.3199999999997s)]
*  during his 120 sacks. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2147.04s)]
*  Probably be a good, probably going to be a good example. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2148.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2150.92s)]
*  Another thing they said, but they showed, um, they showed tape like early in a [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2151.72s)]
*  game of him and the motions coming from the right and he's looking through the [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2154.76s)]
*  left. And so like, there's little things as far as like command, like we want you [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2158.2000000000003s)]
*  to be the commander of the offense. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2162.4s)]
*  And so I like so much of what they're doing right now is we're trying to make [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2164.48s)]
*  you the guy and we're going to give you every tool to make you the guy. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2169.92s)]
*  And we're going to tell you how you have to carry yourself as the guy. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2173.4s)]
*  And so, um, you know, I think you know what though, this is going to take a big [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2176.0s)]
*  jump. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2179.8s)]
*  This is why we spend so much time talking about this position because what works [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2180.56s)]
*  and doesn't work is so complicated and has so many different factors in it. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2185.3599999999997s)]
*  And all the stuff you're talking about is what I believe in the quarterback [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2189.3999999999996s)]
*  position. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2193.3199999999997s)]
*  It's not just about your arm strength. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2193.8399999999997s)]
*  Can you move around? [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2196.3599999999997s)]
*  Like you really, you were a leader of men. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2197.3599999999997s)]
*  You're, you have to be the most charismatic guy in the team. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2199.2799999999997s)]
*  You have to make those guys believe in you for, you know, 12 months a year. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2201.96s)]
*  And the guys that fail are always the guys that fail that test. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2207.4s)]
*  I remember Brady saying, I remember talking to Brady about this way back when [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2211.2400000000002s)]
*  I was covered in the Patriots. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2215.0800000000004s)]
*  And Brady put the most thought into this side of anybody, but go ahead. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2216.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2219.8s)]
*  And he said to me, the only way I can show my toughness is availability. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2220.0800000000004s)]
*  The, that's the only way I can, at that position, the only way I can in this [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2223.8s)]
*  tough, in this, this game where everyone's tough. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2227.1600000000003s)]
*  So the only way I can prove my toughness to the guys who are really out there in [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2229.76s)]
*  the trenches is to be available and to be the first one into the huddle and to [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2232.96s)]
*  be the first one up and to be available to them. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2236.2s)]
*  And I think that was sort of the point with like, you have to be the first one [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2238.64s)]
*  to pick yourself up off the ground too. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2241.3999999999996s)]
*  Cause no matter how hard you got hit, someone's probably hurting worse than [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2243.12s)]
*  you are out there on that field. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2246.7999999999997s)]
*  And like, even like the thing about the motion, right? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2248.72s)]
*  Like, is it going to be like that guy who's coming at that receiver, who's [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2251.08s)]
*  coming in motion, right from your right. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2254.64s)]
*  And you're looking left. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2257.3199999999997s)]
*  Is that guy going to follow you after that happens? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2258.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2261.04s)]
*  Like, or he's, is he going to see that and say, what, what is this kid doing? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2261.6s)]
*  You know, so it's little stuff like that, that I think they're trying to [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2264.68s)]
*  do to empower a Caleb and, um, and, yeah. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2268.32s)]
*  And so I think like, it's, it's just, I think that stuff is really, they're [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2272.36s)]
*  trying to kind of empower him to be the leader there. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2276.48s)]
*  And I even think like the way he handled the, the, the, the, the [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2279.48s)]
*  backlash, the Seth thing, um, I think it was yesterday, he stood up there [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2282.92s)]
*  and he just, he stood in front of the, the, the, the media and said, like, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2287.24s)]
*  look, like he took, took the bullet for it. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2290.92s)]
*  He said, look, like when, when I was coming out, me and my dad were [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2293.88s)]
*  looking at everything, my dad, you know, as any parent would, would like just, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2296.76s)]
*  we were just investigating all of our avenues. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2300.88s)]
*  Once we came and visited the bears and we got to know the organization, we [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2303.12s)]
*  felt differently about it, but of course we looked at the history and it was. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2306.12s)]
*  To me, it was like, he could have hid from that. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2310.96s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2313.2400000000002s)]
*  Like, and he could have just said, I'm not talking about it's in the past, but [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2313.84s)]
*  the only way to kill that story is to stand up there and answer the question. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2316.96s)]
*  So I thought that was a pretty good sign for maybe him maturing a little bit and [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2320.88s)]
*  growing into the leadership role for, I mean, what's, I mean, one of the most, I [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2324.84s)]
*  mean, that market for football, like that's one of the more pressure packed [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2329.52s)]
*  markets in the league. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2333.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, certainly among the hungriest. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2334.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2336.1600000000003s)]
*  If the story is true, admit it's true, and then nobody's going to talk about it [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2336.52s)]
*  anymore. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2339.8s)]
*  It's funny though, that a lot of the stuff heading toward that draft, when [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2340.52s)]
*  people were trying to say what they were concerned about with them and nobody [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2345.12s)]
*  could fully articulate it. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2348.16s)]
*  And then the way this story blew up over the last month is like, it's kind of what [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2349.6s)]
*  we're talking about. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2353.2799999999997s)]
*  We know you have the talent. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2353.96s)]
*  There's more to that position than just talent. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2355.56s)]
*  Are you going to figure out that part? [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2357.44s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2359.24s)]
*  I mean, even Anthony Edwards was taking shit during this OKC series about people [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2360.16s)]
*  didn't like how he handled the game five loss. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2365.44s)]
*  They didn't like that. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2368.8399999999997s)]
*  He disappeared a little bit in game four. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2369.52s)]
*  And it's like, there's just a different spotlight of how you're getting picked [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2371.44s)]
*  apart when you become the guy. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2375.3199999999997s)]
*  And that's part of how it goes. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2376.96s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2378.52s)]
*  You mentioned the getting yourself up fast thing, because there's a social media [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2378.92s)]
*  video of all the hits Brady took, especially early in his career, which were [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2382.7200000000003s)]
*  there's one, I think it's the Colts. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2388.56s)]
*  He's running, he's scrambling on the right sideline and just doesn't see somebody. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2390.2400000000002s)]
*  And he just gets like annihilated. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2393.7200000000003s)]
*  Like it's a video game and he gets right up like that. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2395.6400000000003s)]
*  But he was always passionate about that, which was what was so scary about the ACL [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2398.8s)]
*  injury member, because he didn't get up that time. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2403.04s)]
*  It's like, oh, this is bad. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2405.7200000000003s)]
*  He's not getting up. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2406.64s)]
*  Sometimes you pick up things on these things, covering them in really stupid [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2408.2s)]
*  ways, and this is one example for me. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2411.92s)]
*  So, you know, when I was, when, when I was covering the Patriots, um, when I was in [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2413.48s)]
*  the beat, um, you know, my roommate is one of my best friends from college and he [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2418.24s)]
*  was coaching, he was a limited earnings coach at Northeastern, um, before they [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2421.6s)]
*  dropped football and we were living in the North end. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2425.72s)]
*  And so like he and I would, would talk about all these things. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2427.92s)]
*  And I remember him like it was, it was awesome. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2430.3599999999997s)]
*  Like, you know, when I, when I watched football with him, like he would actually [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2434.04s)]
*  come in and watch with me when I would like watch the Patriots games over again. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2437.84s)]
*  And he said, you know what the difference with Brady is? [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2441.92s)]
*  And I'm like, no, what would you say it is? [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2444.52s)]
*  It's like, it's that he lets the plays develop. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2446.32s)]
*  It's like, if you watch other quarterbacks, they get rid of the ball. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2448.92s)]
*  He is so willing to take the hit. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2451.6s)]
*  And this was before the ACL, right? [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2453.44s)]
*  But he is legitimately like watching him. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2455.44s)]
*  He was saying to me, he's like, he is legitimately giving the receivers [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2458.16s)]
*  an extra second to get open. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2461.28s)]
*  He's giving everything an extra second to develop because he's willing to take [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2462.9599999999996s)]
*  a hit that the other quarterback won't, you know, and I thought that was such [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2467.2799999999997s)]
*  an interesting piece of insight and I think it matches up with what you're [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2470.3599999999997s)]
*  trying to say on Brady and I think the guys, the guys recognize that too. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2473.3199999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2477.2799999999997s)]
*  Like the receivers recognize that too. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2477.7599999999998s)]
*  The guys who, cause that's going to help them out. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2479.7999999999997s)]
*  That was the amazing thing about Drake May last year. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2483.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2485.7999999999997s)]
*  He was always willing to hold the ball for an extra second to the point where [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2486.56s)]
*  we're like, dude, we're going to go three and 14, like. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2489.56s)]
*  Maybe just get rid of the ball, but he didn't want to. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2492.7599999999998s)]
*  And I think that speaks to what you were talking about. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2495.24s)]
*  Concussion at the end of the year. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2498.04s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2499.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2500.8399999999997s)]
*  But also like Rogers last year, I didn't feel like he wanted to keep the ball. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2501.3999999999996s)]
*  I thought he wanted to get rid of it. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2504.56s)]
*  I don't think he wanted to take hits last year. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2505.68s)]
*  What's your fifth thing? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2507.72s)]
*  Um, so I was, I had like tush push here, but I'm so freaking [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2509.48s)]
*  sick of talking about that. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2513.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2515.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm done with it. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2516.24s)]
*  I did. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2517.4399999999996s)]
*  Well, I will say I did love the Eagles owner getting all aggro about it. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2517.8399999999997s)]
*  I like when those guys get aggro in those meetings and he really seemed like he [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2521.84s)]
*  was like challenging the manhood of the other owners, which was like hilarious. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2525.2000000000003s)]
*  How he approached it. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2529.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2530.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2531.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2531.56s)]
*  I think, yeah, I call them the other owners of teenager was, was, was an [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2531.84s)]
*  interesting, interesting strategy. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2535.6000000000004s)]
*  Um, I think I actually think the bigger thing to come out of that meeting is the [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2538.04s)]
*  discussion on the play mat playoff format changing and the let's fucking go. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2543.2400000000002s)]
*  I was hoping you'd bring this up. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2546.92s)]
*  So like, I don't think enough people are talking about this. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2548.6000000000004s)]
*  Um, when they first brought it up in the meeting in, um, in March, they had, uh, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2551.04s)]
*  they, they had probably five or six votes. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2557.36s)]
*  So for people don't know, you need 24. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2560.04s)]
*  Well, we got to explain what the, what the big tweak they wanted to do. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2562.68s)]
*  So they wanted, they wanted, they wanted, so you still get in the playoffs [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2565.56s)]
*  automatically if you win your division, but they want open, but the lions [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2568.52s)]
*  propose open seating more or less. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2572.24s)]
*  It would mean everything like, you know, you're seated purely by record. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2574.48s)]
*  But the genesis of this explained the Vikings week 18 thing, because that's, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2578.8s)]
*  that's where this really starts. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2583.36s)]
*  So I like, so yes, the Vikings, the Vikings in week 18 were in a war with the lions. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2584.5600000000004s)]
*  They, they lose their 14 wins and now they got to go on the most violent game [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2590.36s)]
*  of the year, basically, right. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2594.36s)]
*  And they got to go on the road and we, and, and, and the wild card round and play a [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2595.6000000000004s)]
*  Rams team that rested everybody and week 18 and lost what four or more games than [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2599.36s)]
*  the Vikings, like I think they had 10, I think they had 10 when they were 10 and [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2605.44s)]
*  seven. Yes. They were four games worse. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2608.24s)]
*  But I think the nuance to this is that people think this is about fairness for [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2611.6s)]
*  the league and it's not, it's about games in week 17 and week 18 being compelling. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2619.12s)]
*  And the Rams are actually the example of why the Rams are what scare what the, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2625.6s)]
*  what the Rams did scares the league because the Rams didn't have nothing to [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2630.72s)]
*  play for in week 18. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2635.56s)]
*  If you remember, they could have played to avoid the Vikings. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2636.64s)]
*  Like they could have been the third seed or the fourth seed. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2639.68s)]
*  Sean McVeigh makes the conscious decision. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2642.0s)]
*  It's more important that my guys get the rest than play for the third seed. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2644.08s)]
*  So I'm going to sit everybody down. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2648.52s)]
*  They lose to the Seahawks. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2650.08s)]
*  I was on this podcast saying, I couldn't believe they're playing this this way. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2651.48s)]
*  How would you want to have like, this is nuts. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2655.72s)]
*  You're going to end up playing the Vikings or the lions. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2658.6s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2660.52s)]
*  Why would you want to do that? [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2661.12s)]
*  So that scares the league because it paid off. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2662.32s)]
*  And because now you have a team and the NFL, they're very cognizant of [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2665.04s)]
*  what's happened in the NBA and they look at each, each of the 272 games as [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2668.6s)]
*  pieces of real estate that they can sell. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2673.44s)]
*  So are we making those pieces of real estate as valuable as we possibly can? [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2675.68s)]
*  If you have the format they have now, I think is fair in a lot of ways because [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2680.48s)]
*  of the scheduling formula and the way that works, but you have these games at [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2685.2799999999997s)]
*  the end of the season now, like where it's like, screw it, like we'd rather get [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2690.3599999999997s)]
*  the rest. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2693.44s)]
*  And how does, how does the 18 game season tie into that? [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2694.32s)]
*  And that's what I was going to say is like, this is like, so they're projecting [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2698.16s)]
*  it forward and they're saying, this is going to get worse, right? [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2701.44s)]
*  Like it just works for the Rams and this now is going to get worse. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2704.56s)]
*  If, um, if we don't do something about it. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2708.72s)]
*  And so if they have open seating, like there will be more to play for at [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2711.44s)]
*  the end of the year, the problem is the scheduling formula and the NFL, you [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2714.56s)]
*  only play 14 teams, um, over the course of year, of course you play [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2720.04s)]
*  your three teams in your division twice. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2723.96s)]
*  And you only play teams in your conference. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2726.84s)]
*  You only play 11 teams in your conference. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2729.96s)]
*  So the schedules are so wildly different. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2731.8s)]
*  And I use the example of like the NFC East, right? [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2733.96s)]
*  Like, so the NFC East plays the NFC North and the AFC West this year. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2735.92s)]
*  The NFC West plays the two South divisions. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2740.32s)]
*  So, I mean, you could argue an 11 win season by the Eagles is more [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2744.32s)]
*  impressive this year than a 13 win season by the Niners, right? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2749.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2754.36s)]
*  The Niners have played eight games against those two South divisions. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2755.96s)]
*  So it's the reason the Niners over under is like three wins higher than it seems [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2760.08s)]
*  like it should have been because their schedule is ridiculous. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2764.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2767.64s)]
*  And so like you had the Ram COO, Kevin Demoff stood up in this meeting, um, you [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2768.56s)]
*  know, last week and basically said to the room, guys, we need to decide [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2773.88s)]
*  what we're trying to do here. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2778.08s)]
*  Are we trying to be fair or are we trying to make the games at the end [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2779.4s)]
*  of the season more compelling? [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2784.6s)]
*  And that led to like more big picture talk where I think the scheduling [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2786.7599999999998s)]
*  formula is going to come under some scrutiny. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2791.6s)]
*  Are we doing this right? [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2793.52s)]
*  And I think the scheduling, the scheduling formula I think is mostly fine. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2794.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2799.44s)]
*  But like, that's the sort of big picture things that they're going to be looking at. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2800.56s)]
*  I mean, was it possible that it would be fair to have every, like just have open [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2804.04s)]
*  conference and no divisions, right? [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2810.4s)]
*  Just, I don't, I don't, I do not like that. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2812.72s)]
*  And like, just, but, but, but if you, here would be the idea you play, you [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2815.08s)]
*  play every team in your conference. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2818.56s)]
*  So you have 15 games in conference. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2819.96s)]
*  And then if you're going to an 18 game schedule, you play three games out [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2822.08s)]
*  of conference every year. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2824.88s)]
*  I like, I don't, I'm not wild. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2826.36s)]
*  You would basically, you do two divisions instead of three. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2827.84s)]
*  You play everybody in your division twice. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2831.24s)]
*  That's 14 games. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2833.48s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2836.36s)]
*  You deconstruct the divisions all together. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2837.88s)]
*  So you have a 16 team division. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2840.08s)]
*  You'd play 15. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2842.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2844.48s)]
*  That's, I don't know about that. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2844.68s)]
*  I mean, it's, it's one solution, but I, like, I, but I, the point is, like, I [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2847.04s)]
*  don't think they're going to do that. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2851.2400000000002s)]
*  But the point is like, I think this is the sort of big picture of thinking [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2852.08s)]
*  that's coming out of it. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2855.88s)]
*  Like I saw, you know, on the way out of the meetings, a team president say to [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2856.8s)]
*  somebody else, you know, Hey, I want to be part of the scheduling discussion. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2860.64s)]
*  It's going to be a big picture topic for them over the next couple of years. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2863.64s)]
*  And I think it's going to have way more of an impact than what everybody was [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2867.24s)]
*  focusing on last year with the last week with the Eagles, because it could, you [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2870.92s)]
*  know, they could lead to some structural change in the way that all this stuff [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2875.64s)]
*  works. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2878.68s)]
*  So I, well, think about this last year, Tampa was 10 and seven. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2879.0s)]
*  They're the three seed. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2882.7999999999997s)]
*  The Rams were 10 and seven. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2884.0s)]
*  They're the four seed. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2885.3199999999997s)]
*  The Vikings are 14 and three, five seed in Washington's 12 and five. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2887.0s)]
*  Six seed. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2890.6s)]
*  So, you know, if it's within two wins, I get it because that can be really comes [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2891.68s)]
*  down to, Oh, my division was way harder than yours. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2897.68s)]
*  We had to play the other, other conference division. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2900.3199999999997s)]
*  I think when it gets to like more than four wins, like did they talk about the [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2903.68s)]
*  possibility of you have to be three wins better than the team you're playing in [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2907.04s)]
*  round one to have the home game? [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2911.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2913.36s)]
*  The that was one was like, do we have a marker where it's like, if there's a [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2913.7999999999997s)]
*  three game gap or a two game gap, then like, then, then, then that's a stipulation [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2917.72s)]
*  in there. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2922.08s)]
*  Do you like that? [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2922.56s)]
*  I just feels like too arbitrary for me. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2924.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2926.44s)]
*  I mean, there, there was another one where it was like, you have to be plus 500. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2927.24s)]
*  If you win your division, you have to be plus, I've been saying that for 20 years. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2931.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2935.24s)]
*  You have to be plus 500 to, to, to get the automatic seat. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2935.64s)]
*  Otherwise you're in the pool with a wild card. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2938.3199999999997s)]
*  So you have to be nine and eight or eight, seven and two or whatever it is. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2939.56s)]
*  You have to have some sort of over 500 record. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2944.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2946.7599999999998s)]
*  So they, they, they discussed that, which I, that makes some sense to me too. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2947.04s)]
*  I just, I think, you know, when you're in a league that only plays 17 or 18 games [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2950.7599999999998s)]
*  and you're not playing everybody, it's just the records aren't the same. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2958.04s)]
*  The records don't mean the same thing. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2962.24s)]
*  And so I don't know that there's really simple way to take care of it. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2964.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2968.56s)]
*  If you go through the previous seasons. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2968.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2972.04s)]
*  That like, so in 2022 Tampa was eight and nine. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2972.24s)]
*  Hosting the 12 and five Cowboys in round one. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2977.6s)]
*  That's where it gets stupid. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2982.0s)]
*  And they beat them, right. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2983.16s)]
*  And by the way, they won. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2984.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2985.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2986.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, the sea hawks, you remember the sea hawks and the, the, the beast [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2986.96s)]
*  quake game, the Marshawn game. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2990.16s)]
*  That's the famous one. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2991.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2992.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2993.08s)]
*  So they beat the saints. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2993.36s)]
*  And I think if I remember right, the saints were like 11 and five that year. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2994.24s)]
*  It was like Breeze and the prime of his career and they had to go all the way to Seattle. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=2997.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3001.2s)]
*  They were like, yeah. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3001.4s)]
*  So if it's 17 game, it's 17 game season and it's three wins higher than the other [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3003.16s)]
*  team, I kind of like that because then if you're trying to make stakes for week 18, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3009.04s)]
*  I think that's one way to potentially do it. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3015.44s)]
*  I don't know if it solves every problem, but I thought the fact that the Rams, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3017.3199999999997s)]
*  that you made the key point earlier, the Vikings are in this absolute war. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3020.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3024.96s)]
*  And then they have to go play the Rams the next week who have just, you know, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3025.44s)]
*  been on vacation for a week. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3029.2s)]
*  And coming off the wildfire thing and they're playing and the game was weird in Arizona. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3031.2400000000002s)]
*  Like the Vikings were dealing with all of these strange circumstances. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3035.36s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3038.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3039.0s)]
*  And it was like, and, and, and it, but I, again, like, I think that's what scares, [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3039.08s)]
*  what scares the league is like, if that really works, that means more teams are [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3043.48s)]
*  going to consider it next year. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3047.48s)]
*  Like you don't see it 18 games. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3048.64s)]
*  You could do it for the last two games of the season. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3050.08s)]
*  But even that, like even this coming year, don't you think some teams are going to [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3052.28s)]
*  look at what the Rams did and say, like, we need to consider that if we're locked [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3055.28s)]
*  into a playoff spot and we're just playing for, you know, a single, a single spot in [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3059.44s)]
*  the seating, like maybe we are better off sitting all of our guys. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3064.8s)]
*  And if you watch that game, you go back and watch that game, the Rams look like [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3069.2000000000003s)]
*  they were shot out of a cannon, like it went and the Vikings look like they were [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3071.84s)]
*  dead legs. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3075.6s)]
*  So I think, you know, like that's, that, that's what scares the league about it. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3076.2000000000003s)]
*  And I think it's, it's something that's going to be part of like the big picture [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3080.44s)]
*  discussion going forward. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3083.76s)]
*  Can you explain to everybody in 40 seconds why we're going to 18 games? [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3085.4s)]
*  Cause you know the answer. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3088.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's because of money. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3090.04s)]
*  I don't need 40 seconds to explain that. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3091.6s)]
*  But why would the players agree to it? [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3094.16s)]
*  Um, because it's eventually going to be shoved down their throat. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3096.84s)]
*  And like, I think for the players, it's as much about like, how do we, how do we [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3100.16s)]
*  get as much as we can for it? [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3105.12s)]
*  And I would say like my argument, if I were, if I were the union, what I would [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3107.16s)]
*  want is you need to get me to free agency quicker, like you need to, instead of it [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3110.96s)]
*  being four years on rookie contracts, you need to have it be three years. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3115.16s)]
*  Because if you think about it, like the difference between 16 and the [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3119.08s)]
*  difference between 16 and 18 games, right. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3122.6s)]
*  That's eight more games that you've got to make it through to get to free agency [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3125.2799999999997s)]
*  over four years, right. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3129.2799999999997s)]
*  And you're talking about the most violent game, right? [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3131.92s)]
*  Like, so that's a real thing that, you know, if I'm looking at it, I'm a player. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3134.44s)]
*  I'm like, you got to get me to free agency quicker. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3138.3999999999996s)]
*  The problem is in the NFL is that the union is controlled by the older players [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3140.6s)]
*  who is that going to be a priority for them to get a 22, 23 year old to free [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3145.08s)]
*  agency faster? [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3150.48s)]
*  Generally, historically, it hasn't been the priority for them. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3151.48s)]
*  But I think that that's what you would, if I'm the union, like, I think that would [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3154.48s)]
*  be one of the first things I would ask for is you have to get more of my players [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3158.24s)]
*  to free agency faster. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3161.36s)]
*  And maybe even like you, you look at franchise tags and those sorts of things. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3162.64s)]
*  Is there a way we can loosen the reins on those as well? [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3167.7599999999998s)]
*  So the older players wouldn't want that to happen because they're competing with [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3170.08s)]
*  those people in free agency. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3174.2s)]
*  And then you have a league that 80% of the people, their careers are what, three [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3175.68s)]
*  years or less, four years or less. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3179.16s)]
*  It's the dichotomy of the league. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3181.2400000000002s)]
*  So they can't, they can't go on strike because you just lose the season and I've [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3182.56s)]
*  lost my earning power for one of the four years, basically. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3185.88s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3188.76s)]
*  That's exactly it. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3189.88s)]
*  Like that's the dichotomy of it is like the rank and file and the NFL is making [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3190.6s)]
*  less than a million dollars a year and like is probably going to be out of the [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3193.96s)]
*  league within a couple of years. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3198.64s)]
*  So they've got to take every dime they can get while they can get it. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3200.08s)]
*  And yet the guys who are controlling the negotiation are the 1% of the 1%. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3204.3199999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3209.6s)]
*  We're wrapping up. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3209.8399999999997s)]
*  So apologies to Jim or say in a Trey Hendrickson's contract, but you do have to [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3210.64s)]
*  give me 25 seconds on Drake May, who's really the only thing I have going for me [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3215.2799999999997s)]
*  now and those the Red Sox, club room and Anthony. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3220.3199999999997s)]
*  I would say the best thing I could say is like the new staff's gotten in there. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3223.4s)]
*  There was a lot of things broken last year. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3228.04s)]
*  Josh's offense is pretty complex. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3230.04s)]
*  He has worked on kind of simplifying some things. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3231.92s)]
*  He studied the college game a bunch last year to try to make it a little more user [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3234.8s)]
*  friendly, but, um, the best thing I can tell you, the most encouraging thing I [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3238.84s)]
*  can tell you is that they, they have not needed to like game the offense up to [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3242.48s)]
*  make it work for Drake May. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3248.72s)]
*  He has looked like a professional quarterback in the meeting room and on [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3249.92s)]
*  the practice field at this point. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3253.2799999999997s)]
*  And they got him a left tackle who's who's already sworn to protect him with [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3255.2s)]
*  his life game of Thrones, game of Thrones style, like that lady, what was [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3259.0s)]
*  her brand or brand or whatever? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3263.28s)]
*  I can't remember who it was. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3264.8s)]
*  There was somebody who tried to call bond lady. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3265.92s)]
*  There was somebody who tried to top it later in the draft too, who said that [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3268.0s)]
*  they were going to lay their life down for the franchise. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3271.08s)]
*  I, there was, I don't know if that's going to become a trend now. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3273.08s)]
*  Like who can go more Braveheart on like, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3275.76s)]
*  I've consumed all the Will Campbell content and I'm here for him. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3279.4s)]
*  I love how [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3282.84s)]
*  there's some, [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3283.56s)]
*  all he wants to do is protect Drake May. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3284.12s)]
*  That's his job in life. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3285.88s)]
*  If you Google it, there's some really good like LSU weight room content [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3287.48s)]
*  that you'd really like. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3291.0s)]
*  Like I haven't watched it. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYZ_krjj-xU&t=3292.04s)]
